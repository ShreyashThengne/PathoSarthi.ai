Preface 


For the first time in more than half a century of its publication this 
edition of Todd and Sanford is a work of multiple authorship Only in 
this way could ue expect to offer physicians, medical students, and tech- 
nologists a lolume having authority, recency, and depth, and one reflecting 
the rapidly expanding scope of clinical paiholog> 

Since It IS quite impossible to compress all of laboratory medicine 
into a single volume, ue ha^c chosen to emphasize certain topics that have 
compelling practical applications Thus, the fields of hematology, micro- 
biology, and climcal chemistry have been greatly expanded and each now 
appears as a senes of chapters In addition to the basic chapter on blood, 
tliere are separate chapters on blood groups and on the hemorrhagic dis- 
orders lmmunohematolog>’, a relame newcomer m clinical pathology, 
received due recognition as a key to the understanding of many old patho- 
genetic puzzles and as a practical diagnostic tool and a guide to therapy 
Microbiolog)’ IS dealt with in seven chaptei^, including one on micro 
biologic methods A chapter on clinical chemistry is devoted largely to the 
fundamental principles and basic techniques so essential in the modem 
laboratory, while various special phases of this field are handled in five new 
chapters Water and Electrolytes, Mlcrobiochemical Techmques in Pedi- 
atrics, Tests of Hepauc Function, Serum Enzyme Determinations, and 
Laboratory Tests Aiding in the Diagnosis of Pancreatic Disorders 

Among other topics appeanng for the first tune in the present 
edlUon are chapters on Statistical Tools in Clinical Pathology, Isotopology, 
Hospital Epidemiology, and a brief discussion of space and equipment 
needs in the modern chnical laboratory 

Small print is used both as a warning to those who lack time or 
mebnation to delve into areas of less immediate practical import and as an 
invitation to those who may be differently minded 

Despite the pressure of many new topics in a completely rewntten 
text, we have carefully retained the classic and traditional subject matters 
where these conunue to have current validity or can be used in the teach- 
ing process

TODD and SANFORD 
(xgo8'i^62,) 


The History of a Book 
and of a Medical Specialty 


sufl fata (books have ihcir 
destinies) ‘ This mcicnl phrase is certainly 
applicable to Todd and Sanford s book bc> 
cause of the age of the book and the influence 
it has exerted on clinical patholog} for otcr 
half a century What makes the history of 
Todd and Sanford especially interesting is 
that in it arc mirrored the histor> and the 
dotclopmcnt of clinical pathology In ihfs 
country 

Dr James C Todd a young man age 32 
Associate Professor of Pathology m the 
Medical Department at the Unuersity of 
Denver and pathologist at Mercy St An 
thonys and Denser City and County Hos 
pitals found lime In spile of his many dunes 
to publish in 1906 and 1907 in the Denier 
Medical Times and the Utah Wedicaf Jour 
nal a series of articles entitled "Laboratory 
Diagnosis for the Practitioner This led to 
the publication of the collected reprints of 
the articles in the form of a small book of 
124 pages entitled A Synnbus of Lectures 
Upon Clinical Diagnosis dated 1906-1907 
It was followed one year later by the first 
edition of A Manual of Cltmcal Diagnosis 
published by the W B Saunders Company 
in 1908 

Let us now take a look at what cbnical 
pathology was like in those days Bacten 
ology chemistry and physics had just begun 
to be appbed to medical diagnosis in the 
h\ mg patient At first practicing physicians 


most!) Internists practiced what we now call 
climetd pathology as a part of physical diag 
nosls Then the busy ones among them 
turned o\er this part of the work to their 
joungcrassistants EtentuaUy however the 
amassed knowledge and the necessary skills 
became too much to be handled as a side 
issue it became necessary to apply ones 
fuff time to do justice to the job That is how 
the clinical pathologist came into bemg He 
was a physician first and when he began 
employing instruments and methods of pre 
cision that enabled him to go farther and 
to sec more than was possible with his fi\e 
unaided senses he became a chmeal patholo- 
gist 

The number of physicians who entered 
the new field was small It required courage 
The clinical pathologist of those days was 
looked upon as little more than a techmcian 
with a medical degree That this atutude 
continued is apparent from an advertise 
ment in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association as late as 1920 at a Ume when 
Todds fourth edition was already two years 
old Under those circumstances it re 
guired dedication to speciahze m clinical 
pathology 

How did the climcal pathologist pracuce 
his specialty at the time when Dr Todd be 
gan teaching? It is interesting to read about 
It in the Syllabus

variety of leukocytes and drop a coffee bean 
into the appropriate compartment when a 
cell IS classified " Only two types of leukemia 
were rccognued myelogenous and lympha 
tic No clinical importance was attached to 
the platelets 

The first edition of Todd which appeared 
m 1908 measured 7*- x 5 Inches and had 
319 pages and 131 figures including 10 
color plates The illustrations were of fine 
quality The rcYlcYvtrs hake been uniformly 
in accord on this item through the entire 
liistory of Todd and Sanford As the title of 
the Syllabus indicated and as was stated 
in the preface to the first edition the book 
“btd its cngin same years ago in a shcit set 
of notes which the author dictated to his 
classes and Yvhich has gradually grown by 
the addition each year of such matter as the 
year s teaching suggested The eagerness and 
care with which the students and some prac 
Utioners took these notes and used them con 
\inccd the wntcr of the need of a aolumc 
of this scope In the authors own words 
The book was meant for the student and 
pnetuioner not for the trained laboratory 
worker" Hie emphasis was on simphciU 
and not on “absolute" accuracy 

The two largest chapters occupying more 
than one half of the ishole book were the 
second Unne 02 pages and the third Blood 
74 pages Coagulation rated 20 lines which 
i/idudcd a description of the icebnJque of 
coagulation tune Cytodiagnosis Yvas empba 
sued by de\oUng to it a page of text and 
three Illustrations Including a hint of Its 


possible value In the diagnosis of cincer— a 
harbinger of things to come 

Four years later the second edition ip- 
peared about one-tbfrd thicker wifli its title 
changed to C/micoi Diagnosis A Manual of 
Laboratory Methods The inclusion m the 
title of the word labontory" was svmbollc 
of the new emphasis 

Important additions included Benedicts 
test for sugar m the unne the blood culture 
in typhoid fever Wasscrminn tests and a 
chapter of 23 pages on bacteriologic methods 
in addition to discussions of special bac 
teriologjc procedures in various places in the 
book especlalJy in the chapter on “Misccl 
lancous Examinations ” and a sepante chap- 
ter of 13 pages on "Preparation and Use of 
Vaccines 

Photomicrography was discussed for the 
first time Photographs taken by the author 
nere so designated one of them ts hating 
been "taken with a Kodak " 

Economic fluctuations were reflected In 
the price of microscopes “A first class micro- 
scope of cither American or foreign make 
will cost In the neighborhood of a him 
dred dollars exclusive of the mechanical 
stage ’ In the fourth edition 3918 the price 
of the microscope dropped to S70 00 to in 
crease to S125 00 by the time the fifth edition 
was published in 1925 Reference to tht 
pnee was always accompanied bv the state 
ment "It Is poor economy to buy a cheap 
Instrument" Tht prict was quoted for the 
last time in the seventh edition (1931 ) 

The binocular microscope was rncntloned 
for the first time in tht fourth edition 
f J93B^ “After one has learned to use them 
the new monoobycciiv c microscopes arc cx 
iremcly satisfactory giving the impression 
of stereoscopic vision "

Returning to the second edition, we find 
a few especially interesting entnes “The 
hematocrit is not to be recommended for 
accuracy but seems to be gaming in 
fat or’ Noivadays, of course, tve recognize 
the hematocrit as the most accurate of the 
blood tests 

What we now call a monocyte was then 
divided mto two groups large mononudear 
leukocytes and transitional leukocytes 

Band forms were not mentioned by name, 
although they can be seen m the illustrations 
(Fig 90 p 235) 

Pernicious anemia Tt is frequently im* 
possible to diagnose this disease from the 
blood examination alone “ There was no men 
tion as yet of marrow aspiration (not until 
the tenth edition, 1943) 

“The rare and rapidly fatal anemia which 
has been descnbed under the name of aplas 
tic anemia is probably a variety of pernicious 
anemia ” The morphologic findmgs m aplas 
tic anemia are iveU expressed as ‘ absence of 
anj attempt at blood regeneration ” 

Hodgkin s disease was mentioned in paren 
thesis, with pseudoleukemia as the preferred 
term 

The third edition was pubhshed in 1914 
— agam substantially larger (from 469 to 
585 pages) Sources of error in laboratory 
work were emphasized, because, as stated 
in the preface, “To one ivho sees a great 
deal of the work of students in the chmcal 
laboratory it soon becomes evident that er 
rors in microscopic diagnosis spnng much 
less frequently from ignorance of the typical 
appearance of microscopic structures than 
from imperfect preparation of the slide, 
faulty mampulatjon of microscope, or failure 
to recognize extraneous matters artefacts, 
and other misleading appearances “ 

There was a new chapter on “Serodiagnos 
tic Methods," 52 pages long, iviitten by Ross 
C ^Vhltman, who was Professor of Surgical 
Pathology and Serology at the Umversity of 
Colorado The chapter included a two-page 
descnption of a test for cancer by the Ger- 
man immunologist. \ on Dungem, and it was 
claimed that the test gave correct results in 
o%er 90 per cent of the cases Another in 
teresting item is a 15 page discussion of 
Abderh^den’s test for fermentation reac 
tions The career of this test in Todd and 
Sanford is worth noting for Abderhalden's 
ideas had many adherents In those days 
Dr ^Vhltman must ha\e been one of them, 
as evidenced by this statement ‘It may be 
flatly asserted at the outset that, m spite of 
the se\ere criticism to ^vhich the method 
has been subjected, the correctness of Abder 


halden’s thesis has been abundantly con 
firmed” It is strange that the real purpose 
of the test and its possible clinical apphca 
tions were not stated clearly The lest be 
came a controversial issue as evidenced by 
the cntical remarks of a British reviewer of 
the third edition in the Lancet,- as will be 
mentioned later At any rate, the author was 
quick to recogmze that the Abderhalden re- 
action and the von Dungem test for cancer 
had not been established as clmicallj sigm 
ficant Both were dropped in the fourth edi 
non, nev er to reappear 
Other changes mcluded expansion of the 
space alloted to coagulation to three pages 
as compared with 20 lines in the first edition 
Acute leukemia was treated separately for 
the first tune, whereas, in the preceding edi 
non what is now acute granulocytic leu 
kemia was dismissed with “acute cases have 
been descnbed ’’ Acute lymphocytic leukemia 
was not mentioned and monocytic leukemia 
was not recognized at all 

The firsts in the fourth edition (1918) in 
eluded vital stainmg, the osmotic fra^ity 
test, and tests for blood grouping and cross 
matching Regarding the latter, it was stated 
that "if possible it should always be done 
when transfusion is contemplated” In the 
fifth edition (1925), the recommendation 
was changed ‘Matching of blood should 
always be done when transfusion is con 
templated " ^Vhat is now called the “walkmg 
blood bank" was recommended “In hospit^ 
work, upon the other hand, it will be found 
much more satisfactory to determme in ad 
vance the grouping of a number of indiva 
duals who may be willing to serve as donors 
upon occasion" 

The war may hav e been responsible for a 
seven year interval between the fourth and 
fifth eitions The size of the book increased 
from TV X 5 inches to 9 x 6 inches, and the 
number of pages mcreased from 687 to 762 
The firsts mclude the pbenoltetrachloro- 
phthalem test for hver function and the 
Kolmer complement fixation and the Kahn 
flocculanon tests for syphihs 

Tests for urea and unc acid. foimerl> 
treated in the chapter on unne, were now in 
the chapter on blood together with newly 
added tests for creatinine, blood sugar, and 
carbon dioxide It was not until 1935 that 
these and other tests relating to blood chemls 
trj rated a separate chapter 

Acute infectious mononucleosis was men 
tloned for the first time in the fifth edition 
“Within the past few years a number of 
cases of ‘acute infectious mononucleosis 
with glandular enlargement and fever have

been reported by Cabot, Sprunt and Evans 
Longcope and others The striking feature 
of the blood has been a marked leukocytosis 
ivith preponderance of mononuclear cells 
ivlilch appear to be lymphocytes or cells de 
n\ed from them ” 

The mdex outhne of laboratory findings 
in important diseases appeared for the first 
time and has remamed a permanent fixture 

The sixth edition appeared after only two 
years and now was ivntten by Todd and 
Sanford for Dr Todd s ill health had made 
it necessary to share the burden The preface 
contained a phrase repeated from previous 
editions The 'size has been considerably 
increased Actually this was the first edition 
in which the size was reduced, from 762 
pages to 748 

Dr Todd died on January 6 1928 at the 
age of 54 In an obituary published in the 
Journal of Laboratory and CUmcal Medicine, 
he was given credit for havmg been the first 
to advocate a chair of clinical pathology m 
mcdictd schools * At hjs request a separate 
Department of Clmical Pathology was 


Created in 1916 at the University of Coloradcj 
School of Medicme Dr Todd was sick ^ 
good part of his active life Work on all edi 
tions of his book was done while he wa^ 
bedridden or in a rocking chair 

The seventh edition was published in 1931 
with Dr Sanford as the sole author 

The Sheard Sanford photoelectrometer 
(later the photocolonmeter) was mentioned 
for the first time as being used successfully 
by the inventors but these new methods are 
scarcely beyond the experimental stage and 
are not yet available for general use 
Blood grouping tests were recommended 
for determining illegitimacy of children The 
technique of the Ascbheim Zondek test for 
pregnancy and of the more practical Fned 
man modification was desenbed 
In the preface to the eighth edition (1935) 
Dr Sanford stated that Climcal pathology 
has become a recognized specialty m medical 
practice ” There was for the first time a 
separate 59 page chapter on Clinical 
Chemistry ’ Other innovations included the 
Adis method for counting casts and cells

The History of a Btx)K and of a Mfdical SPEciAL-n 


Interesting are the repeated references to 
the relation between the development of 
chnical pathology as a branch of medicine 
and the influence exerted by Todd and San 
ford The following quotation is from a re 
view of the tenth edition that appeared in 
the American Journal of Chnical Pathology ' 
Referring to the 35 years that had elapsed 
since the publication of the first edition, it 
stated ‘ During these years climcal pathology 
has grown up from infancy to its present 
maturity and has gained recognition as a 
specialty of equal rank with the other 
branches of medicine Todd and Sanford has 
played a prominent part in this develop 
mcnt " 

If It IS true that “histona magistra 
vitae” (history is the teacher of hfe).® what 
does the history of Todd and Sanford teach’ 

1 It was ivnlten in response to a need 

2 The first author had a clear idea of 
what he wanted to achieve, and he sue 


ceeded m transmitting this idea directly 
and indirectly to those who followed 
him 

3 He and those who followed him were 
sensitive in respondmg to the changmg 
demands of the day 

These are some of the plausible explana 
tions of the continued demand for Todd and 
Sanford and the resulting success

It is probable that tlic usefulness of no 
other laborator) instrument Is so depend- 
ent On proper manipulation as Is the use- 
fulness of the microscope, and no other 
laboratory Instrument is so frequently mis 
used bj beginners Some suggestions re- 
garding the proper use of the microscope 
therefore appear to be indicated It imU be 
assumed that the reader Is already familiar 
ivith the general construction of this Instru- 
ment (Fig 1-1) A careful and frequent 


study should be made of the booklet that is 
furnished with each new microscope by 
the manufacturer 

ILLUMINATION 
Source of Light 

Good work cannot be done without 
proper illumination, and this is therefore 
the first and most important consideration 



Figttre l-I The microscope

Figure J-S Small microscope lamps >vith daylight 
glass filters 

for one who wishes eo use the microscope 
effectively 

The light that is generally recommended 
as best Is that coming through a white 
cloud the microscope being placed by 
preference at a north window to avoid di 
rect sunlight At any other window a white 
window shade is desirable Such light is 
satisfactory for all ordinary work Artificial 
light IS, however, imperative for those who 
must work at night and is a great con- 
venience at all times Properly regulated 
artificial light offers decided advantages 
over dayhght for critical work Almost any 
strong bght that is diffused through a 
frosted globe will give fair results Such a 
bulb may conveniently be enclosed within 
a metal box with small openmgs in the 
back for ventilation and a window in the 
' front to transmit the light All such hghts 
have a yellow tinge, and to counteract 


this a blue glass disk, usually supplied with 
the microscope, Is placed in a supporting 
ring beneath the condenser. 

Two types of lamps are shown In Fig 
1-2 Both can be fitted with light filters 
made of “daylight glass," which, when used 
with the mtrogen filled tungsten lamp, 
transmit a light practically indistmguish- 
able from daylight Figure 1-3 illustrates a 
more expensive t>pe of lamp but one that 
has a wide range of usefulness 

The microscope lamp should not stand 
at so great a distance from the microscope 
that Its image fails to fill the aperture of 
the condenser — a condition one can readily 
detect by removmg the ocular and looking 
down the tube 

Fortni of lllumtuntion 

After one has arranged the microscope 
in proper relation to the source of light 
whether this be daylight or an artificial 
source, the next problem is to secure an 
evenly illuminated field of view without 
mottling or any trace of shadows T^is is 
accomplished by manipulating the mirror 
and the condenser When this has been 
accomplished, the Erection and the amount 
of light must be considered in relation to 
the character of the object under examlna 
tion 

Central and Oblique Illumtnntion. Ulu 
mination may be eiiner central or oblique, 
depending on the direction in which the 
light enters the microscope To obtain cen 
tral lUuminauon the mirror should be so 
adjusted that the bght from the source is 
reflected directly up the tube of the micro- 
scope This IS easily done by removing the 
ocular and looking down the tube while ad 
justing the mirror The ocular is then re 
placed and the light reduced as much as 
desired by means of the diaphragm 

In simple instruments oblique illumina 
tion IS obtained by swinging the mirror to 
one side so that the light enters the micro 



Figure J-3 An excellent

for datkfield illuminaUon

scope obliquely In more complicated in 
struments it is obtained by means of a rack 
and pinion ivhich mo^e the diaphragm 
laterally Beginners frequently use ohhque 
illumination mthout recognizing it and 
the> are tliereby much confused If the 
light IS oblique an object in the center of 
the field tviU appear to swaj from side to 
side when the fine adjustment is turned 
back and forth The amount of light ad 
nutted is also important It is regulated by 
the diaphragm 

The bulk of routme microscopic work is 
done with central illumination therefore 
It should be used at the beginmng of each 
rmcroscopic examination Each of the 
forms of illummation however central and 
obhque subdued and strong has Its special 
uses and demands some consideration The 
well known rule “Use the least amount of 
hght that wall show the object well* is 
good but It does not go far enough 

In studying any microscopic structure 
one considers its color its outlme and its 
surface contour No one form of lUumma 
tion shows all of these to the best advan 
tage It may therefore be necessary to 
change the illumination many times dunng 
a microscopic examination 

To see color best use central lUumina 
tion with strong hght A stained glass win 
dow, for example shows the purest color 
when hght is stmanimg through it and 
therefore strong central light should be 
used for examimng stamed specimens 
such as bactena that must be recognued 
chiefly by their color In general strong 
centri light should be ^temated with 
other forms of light m the exammatxon of 
stained specimens 

To study the outlme of an object use 
very subdued central illumination The dia 
phragm should be closed to the point vvhich 
trial shows to be best in each case This 
lUummation is required for the examina 
tion of dehcate colorless objects such as 
hyaline casts and cholesterol crystals 
vvhich are recognized chiefly by their out 
hne The usual mistake of begmners is to 
work with the diaphragm opened too wide 
Strong light will often render semitrans 
parent structures entirely invisible 

To study surface contour use obhque 
light of a strength suited to the color or 
opacity of the object In routine vvork 
obhque illumination is resorted to only to 
study more carefully some object that has 
been found wath central illumination e g 
to demonstrate the cyhndnc shape of a 
hyahne cast 


Darkficld Illumination Darkfield iHumi 
nation consists of blockmg out the central 
rays of light and directmg the peripheral 
rays agamst the microscopic object from 
the side Only those rays that strike the 
object and are reflected upward pass mto 
the objective The object that is bemg ex 
amined thus appears bright on a black 
background By means of this form of lUu 
mination very minute structures can be 
seen just as particles of dust in the at 
mosphere become vasible when a beam of 
sunhght enters a darkened room 

^Vhen usmg the low power objective 
darkfield illummation can be obtamed by 
means of the nng stops with central disks 
which accompany most microscopes when 
purchased The stop is placed in a special 
nng beneath the condenser When the 
regular stop is not available one can use 
the glass disk which is generally supphed 
with the microscope or an extra large 
round coverglass m the center of vvhich is 
pasted a circular disk of black paper The 
size of the black disk depends on Uie aper 
ture of the objective with which it is to be 
used and can be ascertained by trial For 
best results the condenser shotild be oiled 
to the under surface of the slide and should 
be focused on the object that is being 
examined 

\Vhen the oil immersion objective is 
used a special condenser is necessary This 
is known as a "reflectmg condenser or 
“darkfield tUuminator" The most desirable

form of condenser for this purpose is one 
that IS interchangeable mth the regular 
substage condenser One type has a lamp 
built in or attached beneath it (Fig 1-4) 
Some manufacturers offer a condenser that 
allows one to change almost instantly from 
a bright field to a dark field and vice versa 
with, howe%er some loss of quality in both 
Objecmes used for darkfield lUummation 
must be of relam ely low numenc aperture 
(usually less than 0 9), hence, when the 
ordinary oil immersion objecme is used, its 
aperture must be reduced by placing in it a 
funnel stop ’ obtamable from the maker of 
the objective Oil immersion objectives of 
low numeric aperture especially designed 
for t bi«i work but also useful for bright* 
field illumination, are available If exami 
nations by darkfield illumination are made 
frequently, it is advantageous to use a spe- 
cially designed darkfield microscope mth 


the darkfield condenser and illumlnant in 
positive alignment and a rheostat control 
on the subsiage lamp (Fig 1-S) The chief 
use of darkfield illummation in clinical 
work Is for demonstrauon of Treponema 
pallidum in fresh material 

Use of the ilarkfield condenser, A 
small drop of the fluid to be examined is 
placed on a clean slide of the correct thick- 
ness and covered ivith a clean coverglass 
The thickness of the shde is important 
Giving to the need for accurately focusing 
the condenser, and the proper thickness to 
be used mth a particular condenser is gen- 
erally engra\ed upon its mounting This is 
usual!} between 1 and 1 55 mm The lajer 
of fluid must be thin The slide and co\er 
glass must be free from scratches, air bub- 
bles must be aioided as well as an) excess 
of objects (blood corpuscles, pus cells, and 
so forth) other than those sought, since all 
of these tend to brighten the background 
and thus reduce contrast Because of the 
short working distance of oil immersion ob- 
jectnes. No 1 coverglasses are essential 
The source of bght, other than a built m 
lamp, ma> be direct sunbght or, prefer- 
ably. a strong artificial light with a bulls 
eye or a water bottle condenser to deliver 
parallel rays to the mirror 

The regular substage condenser is re- 
moved, and the darkfield condenser is m 
serted in its place and accurately centered 
in the opucal axis To faahtate centermg, 
a senes of concenmc circles is generally 
ruled on the top of the condenser These 
circles are brought to the center of the field 
of a low power objective b> means of cen 
tering screws provided for the purpose A 
drop of immersion oil is then placed on the 
apex of the condenser, the shde is placed 
in posiuon on the stage, and the condenser 
is raised until the oil is in contact with the 
under surface of the slide The low power 
objective is now focused on the shde If the

light is sufficiently intense and the mirror 
properly adjusted a circle or a spot of Lght 
should be seen in the center of the field A 
circle indicates that the condenser is de 
cidedl> above or below its correct position 
(Fig 1-6) The condenser is then focused 
by raising or lowering it until the circle 
becomes a spot of hght and this spot be 
comes as small and as bright as possible 
This spot IS also utilized for centermg the 
condensers provided with the concentric 
centermg circles just mentioned The low 
power objective is finally replaced by the 
high power objective with which the exam 
mation is to be made and this is brought 
to focus and used In the ordmarj way 

For darkfield examinauon the various ad 
justments must be much more exact than 
for a bright field The most frequent causes 
of failure to secure a satisfactory dark field 
with brUhantly hghted objects that appear 
to be self lummous are 

1 Use of an objective with too wide an 
aperture ^Vhen the regular oil immersion 
objective is used its aperture must be re 
duced by means of the stop provided by the 
makers 

2 Failure to focus and to center the 
condenser accurately Very shgbt readjust 
ments of the condenser or mirror after the 
exammation is begun may remedy matters 
provided the shde is not too thick to permit 
accurate focusing 

3 Inclusion of air bubbles m the prep 
aration or in the oil above or below the 
shde It IS generally necessary to remove 
the oil and to apply it agam 

4 Inclusion of too many microscopic ob 
jects in the field This may be remedied by 
diluting the fluid to be exammed or by re 
duemg the thickness of the preparation by 
means of slight pressure on the coverglass 

T/ie Substage Condenser 

For the work m a chnical laboratory a 
substage condenser is a necessit} Its pur 
pose IS to condense the hght on the object 
to be exammed For critical work the light 
must be focused on the object by raismg or 
lowering the condenser by means of ihe 
screw provided for the purpose The image 
of the light source will then appear in the 
plane of the object This is best seen by 
using a low power objective and ocular" 
Should the image of the window frame or 
other nearby object appear in the field and 
prove annojing the condenser may be 
raised or lowered slightly It has been 
recommended that the condenser be re 


0 

moved for certain kinds of work however 
this IS not necessary and is seldom desir 
able m the chnical laboratory 

The condenser is constructed for parallel 
rays of hght With daylight therefore the 
plane mirror should be used and for the 
divergent rays of ordinary artificial light 
the concave mirror which ♦ends to bring 
the rays together is best 

It is very important that the condenser 
be centered accurately in the optical axis 
of the instrument and most high grade in 
struments have centermg screws by which 
it can be adjusted at any time The simplest 
way to recognize whether the condenser is 
centered is to close the diaphragm beneath 
it to as small an opening as possible and 
then to remove the ocular and look down 
the tube If the diaphragm opening does 
not appear in the center of the field the 
condenser is off center The use of the con 
denser also will be considered in the fol 
lowing secuons 

OPTIOVL CONSIDEIUTION 
Objectives and Ondars 

Unfortunately different makers use dif 
ferent systems to designate their lenses In 
this country objectives are designated by 
their focal lengths expressed in millimeters 
or by their initial magnification and ocu 
lars are designated by their magnifying 
power indicated by an “x * 

From the standpoint of color correction 
objectives may be divided into two classes 
achromatic and apochromatic Those in 
general use are of the achromatic type and 
they fulfill all requirements for ordinary 
work Apochromatic objectives are more 
highly corrected for chromatic and spheric 
aberration and are the finest microscope 
lenses produced They give ensp images 
with httle or no trace of color fringes 
which with achromauc objectives can be 
seen readily about the edges or black or 
colorless objects lying in a bnght field and 
are very desirable for photomicrognpliy 
and research A compensating ocular must 
be used with an apochromatic objective A 
third type of objective which is made of 
fluonte requires no special ocular and 
offiers color correction midway between an 
apochromatic and an achromatic objective 
This IS sometimes designated as a semi 
apochromat ” 

The simple oculars that have long been 
used with achromatic objectives are known 
as "huygeman oculars ” With apochromatic 



Clinical Diagnosis by Laborators Methods 



objecmes it is necessary to use special 
"cotupensatmg oculass ” which a-w cor- 
rected to overcome certain defects in this 
type of objective The same compensating 
oculars may be used with oil immersion 
and high power dry objectives of the 
achromatic senes Many persons who wear 
glasses while using a imcroscope find that 
with lower power objectives particularly 
there is a great advantage in using lOx 
“wide field’ oculars, designed onginally for 
the "Greenough type” wide field binocular 
microscope 

Although for cntical work, especiaUy 
with apochromatic objectives the tlnckness 
of the coverglass is very important, one 
pays httle attention to it in the clinical 
laboratory A high power dry objective al 
ways requires a coverglass, but its exact 
thickness is unimportant in routine Nvoriw 
Very low power objectives and oil immer- 


sion objectives may be used without any 
coverglass 

The correction for the medium between 
objective and coverglass is very important. 
This medium may be air or some fluid, and 
the objective is hence either a “dry” or an 
“immersion” objective The immersion fluid 
generally used is an espeaally prepared 
cedar oil, which gives great optical advan- 
tages because its index of refraction is the 
same as that of crown glass It is obvious 
that only objectives W7th a very short work- 
ing distance, that is, 2 mm or less, can be 
used with an immersion fluid 

To use an oil immersion objective, a 
Suitable field for study should first be found 
with the low power objective A drop of 
immersion oil is placed on the slide, and 
the objective is lowered until it is in con- 
tact vfith the ofl and almcist touches the 
slide. This is observed with the eye on a 




The MiCROscoPr 


level with the stage Then, while the oper 
ator looks into the microscope, the objective 
IS raised very slowly until the objects on the 
slide are in focus In order to avoid the 
formation of air bubbles the oil must be 
placed on the slide carefully without stir 
ring It Bubbles are a frequent source of 
trouble and should always be looked for 
when an immersion objective gives poor 
results Bubbles are seen readily by remov 
mg the ocular and looking down the tube 
If they are present the oil must be removed 
and a new drop applied Immediately after 
use both the objectives and the slide should 
be wiped clean with lens paper or a soft 
hnen handkerchief 

Curvature of field through which it is 
impossible to focus both center and penph 
ery sharply at the same time, is a very 
noticeable defect, but it is less senous than 
appears at first sight, particularly for visual 
work It IS easily compensated for by fre 
quent use of the fine focusmg adjustment 
Complete flatness of field cannot be at 
tamed without sacrifice of other, more 
desirable properties Some of the finest 
objectives made, notably the apochromatic 
objectives, show decided curvature of field 

The working distance of an objective 
should not be confused \vith its focal dis 
tance The former term refers to the dis 
tance between the front lens of the objec 
tive when it is in focus, and the coverglass 
It IS always less than the focal distance 
since the focal point lies somewhere ivithin 
the objective, and it vanes considerably 
wth different makes A long working dis 
tance is a very desirable feature Some oil 
immersion objecti\es have such a short 
workmg distance that only very thin cover 
glasses can be used 

The formation of the microscopic image 
demands bnef consideration (Fig 1-7) 
The rays of light wluch are reflected up 
ward from the mirror and which pass 
through the object are brought to a focus 
in a magnified, mverted real image This 
can be focused to appear at different levels, 
but ivhen the microscope is used in the 
ordinary way the image is formed at about 
the level of the diaphragm in the ocular 
It can be seen by remoiing the ocular, 
placing a piece of ground glass on the top 
of the tube, and focusing on it When vieii- 
ing this image a roll of paper or a cybn 
dne mailing tube should be used to exclude 
extraneous light This image. In turn is 
magnified by the eye lens of the ocular 
which produces a second real image which 
IS again imerted The object, therefore ap 


pears right side up This can be seen on a 
ground glass held a few inches abo\e the 
ocular, provided strong artificial light is 
used and the room is darkened WTien the 
eye looks into the microscope it docs not 
see this real image but rather an imerted 
virtual image, ivhich appears about 250 
mm m front of the eye 


Numeric Aperture 

This expression, usually WTitten N A in 
dicates the amount of hght that enters an 
objectue from a point m the microscopic 
field In optical language the numeric aper 
ture is the sine of half the angle of the 
aperture multiplied by the index of refrac 
non of the medium between the co\erglass 
and the front lens Numeric aperture is ex 
tremely Important because on it depends 
resolving power, which is the most impor 
tant property of an objective * 

Resolnng power is the capaaty of an 
objective to separate minute details of 
structure For example the dark portions 
of a good half tone picture appear gray or 
black to the unaided eye but a lens easily 
resolves tins apparently uniform surface 
into a senes of separate dots Resolving 
power does not depend on magnification 
The ^e lines and dots on certain diatoms 
may be brought out clearly and crisply 
(that IS, they are resolved) by an objective 
of high numenc aperture whereas with an 
objective of lower numenc aperture but 
greater magmfjmg power the same di 
atom may appear to have a smooth surface 
with no markings at ah no matter how 
greatly it is magnified Knowing the nu 
menc aperture, it is possible to calculate 
how closely bnes and dots may lie and still 
be resolved by a given objective To state 
the numeric aperture therefore, is to tell 
what the objective can accomplish pro 
vjded of course, that spheric and chromatic 
aberrations are satisfactorily corrected The 
numeric aperture of an objective usually is 
engraved upon the mounting 

It IS an important fact and one almost 
universally overlooked by practical micro* 
scopists that the proportion of the numeric 
aperture of an objective that Is utilized dc 
pends on the aperture of the cone of light 
delivered by the condenser In practice the 
numeric aperture of an objective is reduced 
nearly to that of the condenser (which is 

• ResDlvinK power really depends on two facton, 
the numeric aperture and the wa%cJengt!i of lipnt 
but the latter can be ienored In practice

indicated by lower case letters n a ) * The 
condenser should therefore have a numeric 
aperture at least equal to that of the objec 
tive with which it is to be used Lowering 
the Condenser below its focal distance and 
closing the diaphragm beneath it have the 
effect of reducmg its working aperture A 
condenser whatever its numeric aperture 
cannot dehver through the air a cone of 
hght of greater numeric aperture than 1 
From these considerations it follows that 
the proper adjustment of the substage con 
denser is a matter of great importance 
when using objectives of high numeric 
aperture To gam the full benefit of the re 
solvang power of such objectives the con 
denser must be focused on the object under 
exammaUon it must be oiled to the under 
surface of the shde in the same way as the 
immersion objective is oiled to the cover 
glass and the substage diaphragm must be 
wide open The last condition introduces a 
difficult) m that colorless structures will 
appear “fogged* in a glare of light making 
a satisfactory image impossible when the 
diaphragm is more than three-quarters 
open Wnght suggested that the size of 
the hght source should be so regulated by 
a diaphragm that its image thrown on the 
shde by the condenser coincides with the 
real field of the objective He maintained 
that m this way it is possible to reduce the 
glare of light and to dispel the fog without 
closmg the diaphragm 

One can ea^y determine how much of 
the aperture of an objective is m use by 
removing the ocular looking down the 
tube and observing what proportion of tbe 
back lens of the objective is lUununated 
The jelation of the illuminated central .nor 
tjon to the umlluminated peripheral zone 
indicates the proportion of the numeric 
aperture m use The effect of raising and 
lowering the condenser and of oihng it to 
the slide can thus be easilj seen 

Another property of an objective that de- 
pends largely on the numeric aperture is 
depth of focus that is the capacity of the 
objective to render details in different 
planes clearly at the same time The higher 
the numenc aperture and the greater tbe 
magnification the less the depth of focus 
Any tivo objectives of the same local length 
and same numenc aperture will have ex 
acily the same depth of focus 

Depth of focus can be Increased by clos 

• The numenc aperture of the objectUe l» not 
reduced wholly to that of the condenser becanse 
owing to difftacuon phenomena a part of tbff uiul 
luminated portion of the back lens is utilized 


ing down the diaphragm thus reducmg the 
numenc aperture Great depth is desirable 
for certain work done with the lower power 
objective but when the high power objec 
five IS used closmg the diaphragm does 
not offer advantages to balance the loss of 
numenc aperture by which it is attamed 
In some cases mdeed it is a real dis 
advantage 

Magittficalton 

The degree of magnification should al 
ways be expressed in diameters not times 
which is a misleading term The former 
term refers to mcrease of diameter the 
latter lo increase of area The corapara 
lively low magnification of 100 diameters 
is the same as the apparently enormous 
magmfication of 10 000 tunes Accordmg 
to the system of ratmg magnification used 
m this country the magnifying power of 
an objective is ascertamed by dividing the 
optical tube length by the focal length of 
the objective The optical tube length is 
usually somewhere near 165 mm but it 
vanes with the different objectives and the 
manufacturers catalogs must be consulted 
for an accurate statement of magnifying 
power Some manufacturers follow the 
commendable plan of engravmg both the 
focal length of tbe objective and the initial 
roagmficauon on its barrel 

This system of rating magnification 
measures the enlarged image at the level 
of the diaphragm m the ocular and this 
image is in turn magnified by the ocular 
therefore when an objective and an ocular 
are used together the total magmfication 
IS the .nroduct of the two In the case for 
example of a 1 9 mm oil immersion ob- 
jective with an initial magnification of 95 
diameters the total magmfication with the 
5x ocular is 475 diameters 

It is easy to find the masnifying power of any 
combination of objective and ocular by actual trial 
Place the counting slide of a hemacytometer upon 
the microscope and focus the ruled lines Adjust a 
sheet of paper upon the table dose to the microscope 
in such a position that when the left eye Is in its 
prtmer place at the ocular tbe paper will he in front 
of the right eye at the normal visual distance that 
Ss 2a0 Rim The paper may be supported on a book 
if tiecessary If both eyes are kept open the ruled 
lines will appear to be projected on the paper With 
a pencil mark on the paper the apparent location 
of the tines that bound the small squares used in 
counting erythrocytes and measure the distance 
between the marks Divide this distance by QOo 
mm which is the actual distance between the lines 
on the slide The quotient gives the magnification 
If for example the lines In the image on the paper 
are S mm apart the magnification is 100 diameters

The figures obtained in this way will vary some 
what depending on whether one is near sifted or 
far sighted unless the defect of vision is corrected 
with glasses 

In practice, magnification can be m 
creased m one of two ways 

Using a High Power Objectne As a rule 
this IS the best way because resolving 
power is also increased but it is often un 
desirable because of the shorter working 
distance and because the higher power ob 
jectne often gives greater magnification 
than IS desired or cuts down the size of the 
real field too much 

Using a High Power Ocular This is the 
simplest method It has however certain 
limitations When an ocular that is too 
strong is used there results a hazy image 
m which no structural detail is seen clearly 
This IS caUed “empty magnification and 
results because the objective has not suffi 
cient resolvmg power to support the high 
magnification It has been aptly compared 
wth the enlargement by stretching in all 
directions of a picture drawn upon a sheet 
of rubber No new detail is added no 
matter how great the enlargement 

The extent to which magnification can 
be satisfactorily mcreased by oculars de 
pends wholly on the resolving power of the 
objective and consequently on the numeric 
aperture The greatest tota’ or combined 
magnification that will give an absolutely 
crisp picture is found by multiplying the 
numenc aperture of an objective by 400 
The greatest magnification that can be used

at all satisfactorily is 1000 tunes the nu 
menc aperture For example suppose the 
ordinary 1 9 mm objectne has a numenc 
aperture of 1 30 Tlie greatest magnifica 
non that will give an absolutely sharp pic 
ture is 520 diameters which is obtamed 
approximately by usmg a 5x ocular 
Higher power oculars can be used to pro 
duce a total magnification of 1300 diame 
ters (12 5x ocular) beyond which the 
image becomes wholly unsatisfactory 

SELECTING A MICROSCOPE 

It IS poor economy to buj a cheap micro 
scope For work in a clmical laboratory the 
microscope should preferably be of the 
handle arm type and should have a large 
stage It should be provided with a sub 
stage condenser three or more objectives 
on a revolving nosepiece and two or more 
oculars After one has learned to use them 
single objective binocular microscopes (Fig 
1-8) are extremely satisfactory they give 
an impression of stereoscopic vision and 
also enable the worker to keep both eyes 
open with no feeling of strain 

The distance between the two oculars is 
adjustable to allow for differences in pupil 
lary distances of different mdmduals The 
left ocular may also be focused by turning 
it slightly and thus adjusting it for any 
sbght refractive differences of the two eyes 
If there is a bad refractive error it may be 
necessary to have special lenses ground for 
the oculars in order to obtain stereoscopic 



binocular microscopes

effects Microscopists generally prefer bin 
ocular instruments when they become 
familiar with their use 

The most generally useful objectiies &ie 
16 mm , 4 mm , and an oil immersion, 
which usually is 1 9 or 1 8 mm The 4 mm 
objective may be obtained with a numeric 
aperture of 0 65 or 0 85 If it is to be used 
for blood counting N A 0 65 is preferable, 
since Its working distance is sufficient to 
take the thick cover of the blood counting 
instrument For coarse objects a 32 mm 
objective is very desirable The oculars 
most frequently used are 5x and lOx A 
very low power (2x) and a very high 
power ocular (15x) wall sometimes be 
found useful The micrometer ocular is also 
very useful A mechanical stage is almost 
indispensable for differenual counting of 
leukocytes and certain other work m the 
clinical laboratory 

USE or THE MICROSCOPE 

Optically It IS a matter of mdifference 
whether the instrument is used in the \er 
tical or inclined position Examination of 
fluids requires the horizontal stage, and 
since much of the work m the clinical 
laboratory is of this nature it is vvell to 
become accustomed to the use of the ver> 
tical microscope While working one 
should sit as nearly upright as is possible 
and compatible with comfort and the 
height of the seat should be adjusted 
accordingly 

It is always best to “focus upward,” 
which saves annoyance and probable dam 
age to slides and objectives This is accom 
phshed by bringing the objective nearer the 
shde than the proper focus and then with 
the eye at the ocular by turning the tube 
up until the object is seen clearly The fine 
adjustment should be used only to get an 
exact focus with the higher power objec 
tives after the instrument is in approximate 
focus Jt should not be turned more than 
one revolution 

There will be less fatigue to the eyes if 
both are kept open while using the micro- 
scope and if no effort is made to see ob 
jects that are not in distinct focus Fme 
focusing should be done with the fine ad 
justment not with the eye An experienced 
microscopist keeps his togers almost con 
stantly on one of the focusing adjustments 

Although the ability to use the eyes inter 
changeably is sometimes very desirable, 
greater skill m recogmzmg objects will be 
acquired if the same eye is always used 


CBXcnvia 



Fitjure J-9 Size of the "real fields’ (actual 
areas seen through the imctoscope) with various 
objectives and oculars and tube length of 160 
mm The size differs slightly with microscopes of 
different makes 

The left eye is the more comement, be 
cause the right eye is thus left free to ob- 
serve the drawmg one may wish to make 
with the right hand After a httle practice 
one can cause the microscopic image to ap 
pear as if it were projected on a sheet of 
paper placed close to the microscope under 
the free eye This gives the effect of a 
camera lucida and makes it very easy to 
trace outlines When one is accustomed to 
spectacles, they should not be removed 
It IS very desirable that one work with 
the low power objective as much as possible 
and reserve the high power objective for 
detailed study of the objects that have been 
found with the low power objective This 
makes both for speed and accuracy A 
search for tube casts for example, with the 
4 mm objective is both time consuming 
and bable to failure Even such mmute 
structures as nucleated erythrocytes in a 
stamed blood film axe found more quickly 
with an 8 mm , or even a 16 mm , objec 
tile combined with a high power ocular 
than with an oil immersion lens It is difH 
cult for one who has not measured it to 
realize how small the “real field” is. that is, 
the actual area of the slide that is seen 
through the microscope (Fig 1-9) 

To be seen most clearly, an object should 
be brought to the center of the field Acuity 
of vision Will be greatly enhanced and 
fatigue lessened if all light except that 
which enters through the microscope is 
subdued Strong hght should not be al 
lowed to faU directly on the surface of the 
slide, for this clouds the image, especially 
if a low power objective is used 

A useful pointer can be made by placing 
a straight piece of hair across the opening 
of the diaphragm of the ocular, cementing 
one end with a tiny drop of balsam and 
cutting the hair m two in the middle with 
small scissors When the ocular is in place, 
the hair appears as a black line extending 
from the periphery to the center of the 
microscopic field If the pointer does not 
appear sharply defined, it is out of focus 
and the diaphragm within the ocular must 
be raised or lowered slightly 



The Microscope 


One often wishes to mark a particular 
field on a permanent preparation to refer 
to It again If the mechanical stage is per- 
manently fastened to the stage of the 
microscope, the vernier can be used to 
mark the position of an object on the slide 
There are on the market several object 
markers” by which a desired field can be 
marked with ink or by a circle scratched 
on the coverglass by a small diamond while 
the shde is in place on the microscope The 
circle IS easily located with a low power 
objective 

C.\Ri: OF THE MICROSCOPE 

The microscope is a dehcate instrument 
and should be handled accordingly Even 
a slight disturbance of its adjustments may 
cause senous trouble It is so heavy that 
one is hable to forget that parts of it are 
fragile It seems unnecessary to say that, 
when there is unusual resistance to any 
manipulation, force should never be used 
to overcome it until the cause has first been 
sought It IS not uncommon to see students, 
and even graduates, push a high power ob 
jective against a microscopic preparation 
such force as to break not only the 
coverglass but even a heavy slide 

To bend the instrument at the joint, the 
force should be appUed to the piUac and 
never to the tube or the stage 

The microscope should be kept scrupu 
lously clean, and dust must not be allowed 
to settle on it When not in use, the instru 
ment should be kept in its case or under 
a cover A bell jar is particularly Inblc to 
strike the mechamcal stage and disturb ils 
adjustment In the absence of a special 
cover a square of lintless cloth may be 
draped over the microscope 

Lens surfaces that have been exposed 
to dust should be cleaned only with a 
camels hair brush A small brush and a 
booklet of lens paper should always be at 
hand in the microscope case Surfaces that 
are exposed to finger marks should be 
cleaned with lens paper or a soft linen 
handkerchief moistened With water if 
necessary The rubbmg should be done 
very gently and with a circular motion 
Particles of dirt that appear In the field 
are on the shde, the ocular, or the con 
denser Their site can be determined by 
moving the shde, rotating the ocvlar, and 
lowering the condenser Dirt on the objec 
tive cannot be seen as such, it causes a 
diffuse cloudiness When the image is hazy, 
the objective probably needs cleaning in

case of an oil immersion objective there 
may be bubbles in the oil 

Oil and balsam that have dned upon the 
lenses — an insult from which even dr^ ob 
jectives are not immune — may be removed 
with alcohol or xylol, but these solvents 
must be used spanngly and carefully be 
cause there is danger of softening the cc 
ment between the components of the ob 
jective Some manufacturers now claim to 
use a cement that resists xylol

MEASUREMENT OF MICROSCOPIC 
Or.JECTS 

The importance of size in identification 
of microscopic structures cannot be too 
strongly emphasized Even very rough 
measurements will often prevent humiliat 
mg blunders The pnncipal microscopic 
objects that are measured chmcally are 
animal parasites and their ova and abnor 
mal blood corpuscles The metric system 
IS used almost exclusively For very small 
objects 0 001 mm has been adopted as the 
unit of measurement under the name 
micron It is represented by the Greek 
letter ft For larger objects, if exact meas 
urement is -not essential the diameter of a 
red blood corpuscle (7 to 8 microns) is 
sometimes taken as a unit Of the several 
methods of measurement, the most con 
venieni and accurate is the use of a mi 
crometer ocular In its simplest form this 
IS similar to an ordinary ocular, but it has 
within it a glass disk on which is ruled a 
graduated scale When this ocular is placed 
in the tube of the microscope, the ruled 
lines appear in the microscopic field and 
the size of an object can be detennined 
readily in terms of the divisions of this 
scale The value of these divisions in mil 
hmeters manifestly vanes with different 
magmfications Tlieir value must therefore 
be determined separately for each objec 
Uve This is accompUshed through use of 
a stage micrometer — a glass slide with a 
carefully ruled scale divided into subdivi 
sions, usually hundredths of a millimeter 
The stage micrometer is placed upon the 
stage of the microscope and brought into 
focus The tube of the micrscopc is then 
pushed in or pulled out until two lines of 
the one scale exactly coincide with two 
lines of the other From the numlxrr of 
divisions of the ocular scale which then 
correspond to each division of the stage

micronreter, the value of the fomver in 
microns or in fractions of a millimeter 
can be easily calculated This value, of 
course holds good only for the objective 
and the tube length with which it was 
found The counting slide of a hemacy 
tometer may be used in place of a stage 
micrometer The lines of the sides of the 
small squares used in counting er>throc>ics 
are 50 microns apart \Vhen using the 
counting chamber with an oil immersion 
objective a coverglass must be used other 
wise the oil will fill the ruled lines and 
cause them to disappear Any ocular can 
be converted into a micrometer ocular by 
placing a micrometer disk — a small circular 
glass plate with a ruled scale — ruled side 
down on its diaphragm If the lines on 
this are at all hazy the disk has probably 
been inserted upside down or else the dia 
phragm is out of its proper position 
Usuallj It can be pushed up or down as 
required

Although high grade photomicrography 
requires expensive apparatus and consider* 
able skill fairly good pictures of micro- 
scopic structures can be made by anyone 
with simple instruments 

An> camera that is equipped with a 
focusing screen or a ground glass may be 
used Remove the lens hut retain the shutter 
for maUng the exposures The camera on 
a tnpod or bench block is faced close to 
the ocular ot the microscope A light tight 
connection between the shutter and the 
ocular can be made of a cylinder of paper 
or a cloth sleeve wiiJi drawstrings The 
image will be thrown on the ground glass 
and is focused by means of the fine adjust 
ment of the microscope The degree of 
magnification is determined b> placing the 
ruled slide of the blood counting Insiru 


ment on the microscope and measuring the 
image on the focusing screen For roll film 
cameras without a ground glass use Uic 
lens and set it on infinii) and also focus 
the microscope for infinity Only trial and 
error can determine exposures and the area 
of the histologic section that will be shown 

Oil immersion objectives require more 
light than low power The light should he 
as strong as possible in order to shorten 
exposures In microscopic work the light 
should be carefully centered Use colored 
filters between the light and the micro- 
scope The filter should have a color com 
plementary to that detail which It is de- 
sired to bring out strongly on the pboio- 
graph For blue structures a yellow filter 
is used, for red structures, a green filter 
For the average stained preparation a picnc 
acid yellow or yellowish green filter will be 
found satisfactory When it is necessary to 
suppress deeply stained objects or to bring 
out as much of the internal detail as pos 
slble, T filter of the same color should be 
used 

For histologic sections panchromatic 
plates arc best The length of exposure de 
pends on many factors and can be deter 
mined only by trial Either tray or tank 
development may be used Use the dcvcl 
oper recommended by the manufacturer of 
the film Eastman Kodak has a low priced 
booklet on photomicrography 

PHASE MICROSCOPY 

In 1935 Professor F Zemike of the 
University of Groningen announced the 
application of phase contrast methods to 
microscopy This technique has aroused a 
great deal of interest among medical and 
biologic workers Several types of equip- 
ment arc now available commercially as 
separate units or as accessories to micro- 
scopes of standard design At present the

phase microscope is essentially a research 
instrument, but the large number of val 
uable obser\’ations that have been made in 
cytology, bacteriology, mycology, and para 
sitology suggest that phase contrast meth 
ods may find an important place m the 
techmc^ area of chmcal imcroscopy 
The phase microscope permits objects to 
be visuahzed by virtue of minute differ 
ences in hght absorption and refractive 
mdex Thus, it is possible to see and to 
photograph details that are invisible in the 
ordmary brightfield instrument Phase 
microscopy is most valuable for the exam 
mation of specimens that are too thin or 
too transparent for effective study by the 
ordinary microscope The full significance 
of this techmque m medicme and chmcal 
pathology has not been realized The in 
terested student should consult the excel- 
lent studies of Bennett (1951) and his 
associates 


ELECTRON hllCROSCOPV 

Many years ago it was reahzed that the 
ordinaiy light microscope had been devel 
oped to limits bejond which it could not 
be expected to further resolve the structure 
of objects Fundamentally the function of 
a microscope is to spread out the light 
emitted by or reflected from an object, so 
that minute pomts or lines separated by 
minute distances can be distinguished from 
one another There is no theoretic limit 
to pure magnification using ordinary hght, 
but actual microscopic structure is revealed 
only to the extent that one pomi or line 
in the object of study can be distinguished 
from other points or hnes This important 
matter of resolving power depends on two 
factors the wave length of the hght source 
and the numencal aperture of the lens 
The average wave length of ordmar> mixed 
hght is about 5000 A* It is practically 
impossible to construct lenses with a nu 
mencal aperture greater than 1 5 As a 
rough approximation the distance between 
two pomts that can just be resolved by 
the hght microscope is given by the foUow- 
mg equation 


t 0 61 X 


N A 


Using the limmng factors mentioned, this 
distance becomes 

5000 

d = 061 X 

* The angstrom unit. A, is a length equal to J X 
10-* cen tim eters or 0 1 


Thus, It IS seen that two pomts or hnes 
must be separated by a distance of no less 
than about 2000 A or 200 m^ in. order to 
be clearly distinguished in the microscopic 
field 

Understandmg the limits of hght mi 
croscopy immediatel} suggests a means to 
surmount these linuts Ultraviolet rays 
range from about 100 A to 4000A m wave 
length Using special quartz lenses and 
photographic equipment for recording ihe 
unage, it has been possible to double the 
resolvmg power or to reduce by approxi 
mately one half the distance between scruc 
tural lines and pomts that can be sensed 
in the microscopic field Ultraviolet micros 
copy has proved to have significant use 
fulness entirely apart from the relatively 
slight improvement in resolvmg power 
Ceitam chemical constituents of cells par- 
ticularly the purme and pyrimidine nng 
components of nucleic acids, strongly ab- 
sorb ultraviolet rays at characteristic wave 
lengths Some of these chemical substances 
can be identified and certam phases of their 
meiabohsm can be followed by ultraviolet 
microscopy 

The electron microscope depends for its 
operation on the fact that a stream of elec 
Irons moving at high velocity behaves like 
a beam of light of very short wave length

Focusing of the electron beam is accom 
phshed by adjustable magnetic or electro- 
static fields The image is made Msiblc to 
the c>e by means of a fluorescent screen or 
is recorded directly on photographic film 
Commercial!) a\ailable electron micro- 
scopes are capable of resolution to as little 
as 20 A or e\en 10 A Magnification can 
be achie%ed to as great as 50 000 or c\cn 
100 000 times 

Because electrons are readily stopped or 
deflected by any molecular particles includ 
ing gas molecules in the air electron mi 
croscopy must be carried out in a \acuum 
This imposes a setere limitation on the 
i>pc of specimen that can be studied and 
the manner in wluch materials must be pre- 
pared for examination Preparations must 
be complete!} desiccated and mounted in 
extremely thin films Electron microscopic 
exploration of biologic material especially 
the study of human and animal tissues has 
only quite recently been opened up uith 
the de%elopracnt of plastic embedding media 
and techniques for the production of cx 
tremely thin sections (Pease 1960) (Fig 
1 11 ) 


Laboratory AfmiODS 

Electron microscopy has made important 
contributions to bacteriology, and the tech 
nique has become practlealh indispensable 
to the science of \irology It has made 
possible a detailed structural analysis of 
subcellular elements such as the mito- 
chondria which are far below the resoh 
mg power of the ordinary light microscope 
By combining biochemical and electron 
microscopic methods wc are beginning to 
approach the structural basis of normal 
and abnormal function at or near the molec- 
ular lc\el Although electron microscopic 
methods roust now be classed among the 
tools of research it seems highly probable 
that they will be developed along incrcas 
ingly practical lines and find their way 
into the clinical laboratory

of individuals who are in normal health 
The average viJue )s calculated The dis

DtCISION CRITERION NO 1 

Does the individual differ from the nor 
mal jpopulation with respect to a particular 


measurement? If the value lies outside the 
:t three standard deviation limits (99 7 per 
cent), then jt is.cJear that the indjvfdualln 
question does not belong to the nomal 
^pulation If the value lies outside the 
two standard deviation limits (95 per Cent) 
and ivjthin the three standard deviation 
limits (99 7 per cent), the individual pos 
sibl> may not be one of the normal popu 
lauon The physician would need to give 
extra thought and attention to this patient 
A typical normal distribution of meas 
ured values on a normal human population 
is shown m Fig 2-2 The hematocrit of 
loo normal young women is recorded in 
the frequency distribution form The aver 
age hematocrit equals 41 0 ml pacl,ed red 
Cells per 100 ml of whole blood One 
standard deviation limit including 68 pet 
Cent of the measurements is rt 2 4 ml 
packed red blood cells per 100 ml whole 
blood The two and three standaid devia 
tlon limits are 4 8 and 7 2 ml respectively 
Therefore using the av erage and the stand 
ard deviation value the complete frequency

Guaranteeing Reliable 'Measurements 
The second laboratory responsibility is to 
guarantee the reliabihty of every measure 
ment Two difficulties should be identified 
First no method of analysis gives exactly 
the same result each time it is repeated 
There is an inherent variability character 
istlc of each measurement procedure that 
cannot be avoided Second practical con 
siderations hmit the amount of sample 
available for measurement Each sample is 
one of a population of possible samples that 
could have been taken from the subject 
Quality control systejn for the climcnl 
laboratory Quality control systems have 
been developed to guarantee reliability and 
at the same time require only limited blood 
samples A large number of identical sam 
pies from the same large pool are prepared 
and are frozen to preserve stability Every 
batch of laboratory measurements is ac 
companled by one of the identical pool 
samples The variability of repeated anal 
yses Is measured under regular operating 
conditions using the identical samples and 
is expressed in standard deviation units If 
the quality control sample docs not fall 
within the known limits of inherent van 
ability the measurements art rejected and 
the analyses are repeated In this way each 
laboratory measurement is accompanied by 
a known sample which undergoes exactly 
the same steps and conditions as the un 
known samples 

There are several acceptable methods for 
setting up quality control Tlic system de 
scribed has been found practical but each 
laboratory should develop a quality control 
technique suitable for its own purposes 

Prrfmrntton of a rjuaUty control fntol 
Excess serum is salvaged dally from rego 
lar specimens and froren in a dcepfrccre 
until 2 000 to 3 000 ml arc collected 
Hemolyred llpcmic and jaundiced sera are 
avoided Fasting human donors may be 
used If the supply of scrum is not avail 
able Beef scrum is available commercially 
and is not expensive The pool should be

thawed and mixed thoroughly Then the 
pool is divided into samples (aUquots) 
which are convenient for siongc in the 
deepfreeze Pyrex screw cap lubes arc con 
venlent Plastic vials capped to prevent 
evaporation are satisfactory 

It is Important to remember that wlicn 
frozen serum melts pure water hyers out 
at the top surface Be sure to mix ihor 
oughly before using each sample This is 
the most frequent cause of out-of-control 
measurements Changes of 50 to 100 per 
cent can be caused by incomplete mixing 
Cn/ri(Jn/ioii of ami/ ifmidord

pie IS m control, the mdividual sample 
measurements are rehable because no un- 
usual variables are operating

due to methodology from the real change 
in the patient The information gain^ 
from quality control supplies the physician 
with the tool by which he can follow the 
progress of the patient under medical 
therapy from day to day or month to 
month The significant change limit, three 
tunes the quality control standard devia

sults from a change m the patient and not 
from the method 

DtaSION CRITERION NO 3 

What change in successive measure 
ments indicates a real change in the pa 
tient? A change greater than three tunes 
the quahty control standard deviation is 
called the significant change limit 

What significant change limits indicate 
good laboratory performance? At present 
only preliminary estimates can be given 
Table 1 shows the values obtained in well 
run laboratories Note that there is not 
complete uniformity of performance, and 
the final entenon should be the use to 
which the test is being put at the bedside 
Unused precision is very expensive The

this IS important information However, 
this should not lead to the conclusion that

such a companson is useful in making the 
diagnosis of the disease in question The 
diagnosis of disease in an individual de- 
pends upon the capacity of a test to show 
a complete separation of a normal popula 
tion from a diseased population (Fig 2—4 
A and C) A significant difference between 
averages can be shown when there is con 
siderable overlap in the two populations

tion (Fig 2-4C) The crux of the matter 
IS this How successful is a particular test 
in indicating disease in the problem case 
diagnostically in the presence of other dis 
ease states and in the early stages of the 
disease when symptoms and physical signs 
are not present that is (Fig 2—4) popu

Improvement of Methodulogy and In 
strumcntation It is evident that to reduce 
the mherent variability of measurements 
the major effort should be in the areas of 
methodology instrumentation and primary 
standards A method or an instrument that 
IS highly reproducible on a single day may 
show considerable day to-day vaiiabibty 
over the period of a year Therefore it is 
important to evaluate new methods and 
new instruments for their inherent vana 
bility over a years time in order to truly 
evaluate their acceptabihty in the field No 
methods currently published carry this 
evaluation nor do any of the new instru 
ments The tools are readily available for 
such evaluation and should be utilized In 
deed workers in the field should demand 
this information 

The new instruments and new methods 
constantly being added only create more 
confusion and increase the vanabihty of 
this problem smee none are accompanied 
by the proper credentials for reproducibihty 
and quahty control under regular operatmg 
conditions 

Technique for Comparing New Meth 
ods uitft Standard Methods and Netv 
Instruments uith Established Instru 
ments 

1 Collect a sample pool large enough 
to make 20 measurements with 
each method or instrument 

2 Make the senes of 15 to 20 meas 
urements under actual operating 


conditions including the effect of 
different days 

3 Compute the averag® and standard 
deviation for each senes of meas 
urements 


DECISION CRITERION NO 4 

Do the methods or instruments under in 
vestigation have the same precision or 
does one show significantly better prcci 
sion^ If one standard devnation is one half 
the other this method or instrument can 
be said to be significantly more precise 

DECISION CRITERION NO 5 

Do the methods or instruments give the 
same average values? If the difference 
between the two averages is three tunes 
greater than the larger standard deviation 
It can be concluded that the difference be 
tween the averages is significant This 
would indicate a constant error or differ 
ence between the method or instruments

IN SUMMARY 

Laboratory measurements are useful only 
when mterpreted with the knowledge of 
the normal population variation and an 
understandmg of the inherent variability 
present in all instruments and methods 
The standard deviation is a descriptive 
tool which IS very useful to describe \ana 
tion in populations These properties make 
It indispensable m quality control systems 
and m other cntena related to the decision 
making process in the laboratory and at the 
bedside

The Urine 


B) RAYMOND A SANFORD, M D , ami 
BENJAMIN B WELLS, M D I 1 


Examination of the unne is one of the roost 
important of all medical diagnostic pro- 
cedures The fact that this body fluid is so 
readily a\ailable and that much of the tech 
nology applied to its study is relatively easy 
to accomplish has led to the reprehensible 
practice of routine examination en masse 
The large number of unnalvses ordered 
wthout specific reference to the ^agnostic 
problem at hand and often mtbout subse- 
quent mterpretation has senously reduced 
the effectiveness of this examination and 
has created an unwarranted disregard for 
It among both physicians and laboratory 
workers As the end product of a compb 
cated and delicately balanced physiologic 
system the unne is a valuable index to 
many normal and pathologic mechanisms 
Not only is the unne altered by most in 
tnnsic diseases of the kidney but many 
extrarenal conditions produce changes that 
have important diagnostic impbcations In 
order to assure the inherent advantages of 
the unnalysis certain simple techracal pre 
cautions must be constantly observed Of 
these there are tno that eclipse all others 
the unne specimen must be fresh and the 
urinary sediment must be examined micro- 
scopically by someone who is thoroughly 
tramed m this skill and genumely inter 
ested m its results preferably the physician 
himself

game substances make up about 35 gm 
and the inorganic substances about 25 gm 

The most important organic constituents 
are urea unc acid and creatinine Urea 
constitutes about half of all the solids or 
about 30 gm in 24 hours TTie chief in 
organic constituents are the chlondes 
phosphates sulfates, and ammoma The 
chlondes practically all in the fonn of 
sodium chlonde make up about half of the 
inorganic substances or about 13 gm in

tests which depend on the excret’on of

end products of normal and abnormal me- 
tabolism are excreted in the urine Deter

beyond the scope of the cbnlcal laboratory

should discard this urine but should save 
all the urine voided up to 8 a m of the

Qilondes Chlorides are derived from the 
food and are excreted mamlj as sodium 
chloride The amount excreted normally is 
10 to 15 gm in 24 hours It is much 
afTected by the diet and is reduced to a 
minimum in starvauon 
Excretion of chlorides is diminished in 
some forms of nephritis an^ in febnie dis 
eases, espeaally in pneumonia and in in 
flammation, which lead to the formation of 
large exudates In extensive bums there is 
a dimmution of chlondes m the unne

Quantitative test for chlorides The 
well known method of Schales and SchaJes 
(194!) IS simple, reliable, and suffiaently 
accurate for ordinary clinical work 

Reagents 

1 Standard sodium chlonde solution 
Dry sodium chlonde at 120® C overnight 
Make aqueous solution containing 1 gm 
per liter, using chemical balance, volumet 
nc flask, and distilled water 

2 2 N mine acid Dilute 115 4 ml 
of concentrated nitric acid to 1 hter with 
distilled water 

3 0 05 N ratric acid Dilute 25 ml 
of 2N mtnc acid to 1 liter with distilled 
water 

4 Indicator Dissolve 100 mg di 
phcnylcarbazone (Eastman Kodak No 
4459) m 100 ml of 95 percent alcohol 
Store m refrigerator in dark bottle Make 
fresh solution each month Deepening color 
of mdicator solution indicates detenoration 

5 Standard mercunc nitrate solution 
Dissolve 10 to 15 gm of mercunc nitrate 
m I liter of distilled water Allow insoluble 
material to settle Take 730 ml of the 
supernatant hquid, add 100 ml of 2N 
mtnc acid, and dilute to S liters with dis- 
tilled water Titrate samples and dilute 
until 1 ml of mercunc cWoride is equiva 
lent to 0 50 ml of the standard chlonde 
solution This solution keeps mdefinitel) 

Technique 

1 Dilute 0 5 ml of unne to 5 ml with 
0 05 N nltnc acid in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer 
flask 

2 Add 8 drops of indicator soluuon 

3 Titrate with mercunc mtrate solu 
Uon to the first defimte and permanent 
pink violet color In unnes contaming high 
concentrations of protem, the color of the 
sbghtly turbid mixture is first salmon red 
and ciianges after titration to deep wolet 
As titration proceeds slowly, the soluuon 
becomes clear or pale yellow Tlie end 
point is a sharp change to pale violet 

4 Smee 1 ml of mercunc nitrate is 
equivalent to 0 5 ml of standard sodiiim 
chlonde contaming 1 mg per ml when 
a unne sample of 5 ml is used, the num 
her of ml of mercuric nitrate used is 
equivalent to the mg /ml or gm /L of 
sodium chlonde in the unne

mercunc nitrate soluuon used by the 24 
hour \olume to gue the excretion rate of 
chloride (as sodium chloride) in gm per 
24 hours 

Phosphates Phosphates are denied 
largely from the food, only a small pro 
portion results from metahoUsm The nor- 
mal daily output of phosphoric add js 
about 2 5 to 3 5 gm 

The urinary phosphates are of two hinds 
alkaline phosphates which make up two 
thirds of the whole and include the phos- 
phates of sodium and potassium, and earthy 
phosphates, which constitute one third and 
mclude the phosphates of calcium and mag- 
nesium Earthy phosphates are frequently 
thrown out of solution in neutral or alka- 
line unne and, as amorphous phosphates, 
form a lery common sediment This sedi 
ment seldom indicates an excessive excre 
tion of phosphoric acid It is usually merely 
an indication of diminished acidity of the 
urine or of an increase m the proportion 
of phosphoric acid elimmated as earthy 
phosphates IVhen the unne undergoes am- 
moniacal decomposition, some of the am 
monia set free combines with magnesium 
phosphate to form ammoniomagnesium 
phosphate (triple phosphate), which is only 
slightly soluble in alkahne unne and is 
deposited in typical crystalline form 

From the clinical point of view variations 
in the amount of phosphates in the urme 
are unimportant, and no method for their 
determination need be given here 

Sulfates The unnary sulfates are denved 
partly from the food, especially meats, and 
partly from body metabolism The normal 
urinary output of sulfuric acid is about I 5 
to 3 gm daily It is increased in conditions 
associated %vith actue metabohsm, in gen 
eral the amount that is excreted may be 
taken as a rough index of protein metab- 
ohsm 

About nine-tenths of this sulfunc acid 
IS eliminated in combination ivith \aTious 
mineral substances, chiefly sodium, potas- 
sium, calcium, and magnesium (minerol or 
-preformed sulfates) A tenth is eliminated 
in combination wth certain aromatic sub* 
stances, which are mostly products of pro- 
tein putrefaction m the intestine but are 
derived in part from destructive metabolism 
(conjugate or ethereal sulfates) Among 
these aromatic substances are indole, 
phenol, and skatole By far the most im- 
portant of the conjugate sulfates, and 


27 

representative of the group, is potassium 
indoxyl sulfate 

Calcium There may be considerable vari- 
ation in the amount of calcium that is 
excreted m the unne A very simple test for 
calcium in the unne has been devised by 
Sulkowitch This is a rough quantitative 
test for the amount of calcium that is 
excreted in cases of hvpoparathvroidlsm 
hyperparathyroidism, or urinary calculi 

Siilhou Itch's test fflnniey niirf Sutko 
ifttch, 1937) The patient should be kept on 
a neutral, low calcium diet before the test 
IS begun Save a 24 hour specimen of 
urine 

Reagent 

Take 2 5 gm of oxalic acid 2 5 gm 
of ammonium oxalate, and 5 ml of glacial 
acetic acid Dissolve in distilled water and 
make up to ISO ml 

Technique 

1 Take equal parts of unne and Sulko- 
witch's reagent m a test tube 

2 Mix thoroughly and allow to stand 
for two or three minutes The calcium m 
the urine will come down almost immedi 
ately as a fine, white precipitate of calcium 
oxalate 

If there is no precipifntc, there is no cal 
cium and the concentration of scrum cal 
cium is probably 5 to 7 5 mg per 100 ml 
If there is a fine, uhite cloud, there is a 
moderate amount of calcium and the value 
for the serum calcium is in the normal 
range, that is 9 to 11 mg per 100 ml 
If the precipitate is heavy like milk, or len/ 
heavy, the danger of hypercalcemia is pres 
ent The amount of precipitate may be 
graded 1, 2, 3, or 4 

Urea From the standpoint of physiology 
urea is the most important constituent of 
the urine It Is the principal waste product 
of metabohsm and constitutes about half of 
all the solids excreted About 20 to 35 gm 
of urea is excreted in tlie unne In 24 hours 
It represents 85 to 90 per cent of the total 
nitrogen of the unne, and its quantitative 
estimation is a simple, though not very 
accurate, method of ascertaining the state 
of nitrogenous excretion This is true, how* 
ever, only in normal Individuals on an 
average mixed diet If the diet Is low In 
protein, the urea may represent only 60 
per cent of the total nitrogen Under path 
ologtc conditions the proportion of nitrogen

dislnbuted among the vanous nitrogen 
containing substances undergoes great var 
lation The onl> accurate index of protein 
metabohsm is therefore, the total output 
of nitrogen which can be estimated by 
the Kjeldahl method or by one of its mod 
ifications When a mixed diet is being used, 
the lutrogen of the unne is distributed 
about as follows urea mtrogen, 86 9 per 
cent, ammonia mtrogen 4 4 per cent, 
creatinine nitrogen, 3 6 per cent, unc acid 
mtrogen 0 75 per cent and "undetermined 
nitrogen,” chiefly m ammo acids, 4 3 per 
cent 

Normafly the amount of urea excreted 
m the unne is greatly influenced bj exer 
cise and diet It is mcreased by copious 
dnnkmg of water and bj the admmistration 
of ammonium salts of orgamc acids 

The excretion of urea is increased patho- 
logically in fevers and m many other con 
ditions accorapamed by increased metab- 
ohsm tissue destruction or absorption of 
large exudates A decrease m the amount 
of urea m the unne is due either to less 
ened formation nithm the body such as 
may occur m se\ere hver disease or to 
retention of urea as maj occur in cases 
of renal failure Determination of unne 
urea alone is not used as a practical climcal 
obser\ation The method is used however 
as a part of the urea clearance test for the 
study of kidney function 

Uric Acid Unc acid is the most important 
of a group of substances called “punne 
bodies ” which are deni ed chiefly from the 
nuclems of food (exogenous unc acid) 
and from metabolic destruction of the 
nuclei of the body (endogenous unc acid) 
The daily output of unc acid in the unne 
is about 0 4 to 1 gm The amount of the 
other punne bodies together is about a 
tenth that of unc acid Excretion of these 
substances is greatly mcreased by a diet 
nch in nuclems as sweetbreads and h\er 

Unc acid exists m the urme in the form 
of urates chiefly of sodium and potassium 
uhich m concentrated unne are readily 
thrown out of solution and constiiute the 
fanuhar sediment of “amorphous urates " 
This together ivith the fact that unc aad 
IS frequently deposited as crystals consu 
tutes Its chief interest to the practitioner 
It is a %ery common error to consider these 
deposits as evidence of excessne excretion 
of unc acid 

The greatest increase of unc acid occurs 
in leukemia m which there is extensile 
destruction of leukocytes m diseases asso- 
ciated wth acuve destruction of the liier 


and other organs nch m nuclei and dunng 
absorpuon of a pneumomc exudate There 
IS generally an mcrease dunng roentgeno- 
logic treatment The excretion of unc acid 
IS decreased before an attack of gout but is 
mcreased for several days after the attack 
An mcrease is also noted m cases of acute 
fever 

Urmary excreuon of unc acid is in 
creased by admmistration of ll-oxygenated 
adrenocortical hormones and by ACTH 
Determination of the extent of nse in 
unnary unc acid m relation to creatmine 
excretion after administration of ACTU has 
been used as a test of the functional reserve 
capacity of the adrenal cortex 

Ammonia A small amount of ammoma 
IS always present combined with hydro- 
chlonc, phosphonc, and sulfunc acids 
Estimated as NH, the normal average is 
about 0 7 gm in 24 hours This represents 
4 to 5 per cent of the total mtrogen of 
the unne, ammoma standing next to urea 
m this respect 

Under ordmary conditions most of the 
ammoma that results from metabohc proc 
esses IS transformed mlo urea When, how 
ever, acids are present m excess, either 
from ingestion of mineral acids or from 
abnormal production of acids within the 
body (for example, diacetic and beta*oxy 
butyric acids in ^abates wellitus), am 
moma combmes with them and is so ex 
creted the urea of the unne being corres 
pondmgly decreased This is an important 
part of the mechamsm by which the body 
protects itself against acid intoxication 
The ammonium salts are not, however in 
creased m all forms of acidosis (notably, 
in acidosis of nephntis) 

In diabetes melhtus and m other path 
ologic conditions associated with excessive 
production of diacetic and beta-oxybutync 
acids tbe output of ammomum salts is a 
very important index of the degree of 
acidosis In diabetes associated with mild 
acidosis 1 or 1 5 gm of ammoma may be 
eliminated daily, the amount may increase 
to 4 or 5 gm m cases of severe diabetes 
and even to 8 or 10 gm m extreme cases 
The excretion of ammoma is hkewase m 
creased in permcious vomiting of preg 
nancy but not m nervous vomiting it also 
IS mcreased in diseases that Interfere with 
the power to synthesize urea notably 
cirrhosis and other destructive diseases of 
the hver and diseases associated with de 
Saent axygenation Certain drugs have a 
marked influence on the ehminaoon of 
ammoma FLxed alkalis and salts of or 



The 

ganic acids decrease the elimination, while 
inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, 
increase it 

The ammonia just referred to is in the 
form of ammonium salts and should not be 
confused, as it often is ivitb the accumu 
lation of free ammonia, which is den\ed 
from decomposition of urea after the unne 
is secreted and which leads to \olatile 
alkaUmty

Substances that appear in the unne only 
m pathologic conditions — namely, •protem, 
sugar, acetone bodies bile 'urobdin fiemts 
globm and hematoporphyrin — are of much 
more interest to the chmcian than are those 
that ha\e just been considered Most of 
these are present normally in negligible 
traces 

Protein 

Of the proteins that may appear in the 
unne, serum albumin and serum globulin 
are the most important Mucin, proteose, 
and a few others are found occasionally 
but are of less interest 

Albuminuria Albuminuria is a term that 
has been used to designate the presence 
of serum albumin or serum globulin in 
the unne It is probabl> the most important 
pathologic change in the unne and also 
the most frequent It may be either acci 
dental or renal The physiciqn can make 
no greater mistake than to regard all in 
stances of albummuna as indicative of 
renal disease 

Accidental or false alhumimma is due to 
admixture with the unne of albuminous 
fluids such as pus blood and vaginal 
discharge The microscope will usually re- 
veal its nature It occurs most frequently 
in cases of pjehtis cystitis, and chronic 
vaginitis, and the quantity of alburmn is 
usually small 

Penal alimmintmo refers to albumin that 
has passed from the blood into the unne 
through the walls of the kidne> tubules 
or the glomeruli 

Albuminuna of sufficient degree to be 
recognized readil> by ordinar) clinical 
methods probably never occurs as a physio- 
logic condition The so-called physiologic 
albuminuna appears only under conditions 
that must be regarded as abnormal Among 
these are excessive muscular exeition by 
persons unaccustomed to it, excessive In 
gestion of proteins (dietetic albuminuna)* 
prolonged cold baths, the later stages of 


Urine 09 

pregnancy and childbirth In these condi 
tions the albuminuna Is ordinarily of slight 
degree and transient Albumin is frequently 
present m the unne of mfants possibly 
because the kidney is particularly sensitive 
to irritants 

Cenain other forms of albuminuna have 
sull less claim to be called physiologic but 
are not always regarded as pathologic 
Among these is cyclic orthostatic or pos 
tural albuminuna This appears at certain 
penods of the dav varying in different 
cases, and disappears after rest in bed 
Most frequently the maximal output of 
albumin occurs late in the afternoon Thi-, 
form of albuminuna occurs for the most 
part in neurasthenic persons dunng adoles 
cence and is by no means rare In somt 
cases at least it is associated with curva 
ture of the spinal column (lordotic aibu 
mwiuna) Renal function tests usually vield 
results within normal hmits Tube casts 
may or may not be present A considerable 
amount of protein that is precipitable by 
aceuc acid in the cold has been noted m 
many cases It is noteworthy that nephritis 
sometimes begins with cyclic albuminuna

^Ctrnilalory changes tn the kidneys 
Anemia or congestion, such as occurs with 
excessive exercise chronic heart disease, 
severe general anemia, and pressure on 
the renal veins (as in the later stages of 
pregnancy ) mav cause albuminuna The 
quantity of albumm is usually small Its

renal irritation there is slight damage to 
glomeruli or renal cells with cloudy swell 
ing or even more serious degeneration but 
defimte nephritis is not present The amount 
of albumin is generally small and the con 
dition is transitory Renal irritation is prob- 
ably the chief cause of toxic and fcbnle 
albuminuna, and it is at least a contnbut 
Ing factor in the albuminuna of pregnancy 
Among the agents that in toxic doses miy 
cause albuminuria an? mercury cantha 
tides turpentine mustard arsenic lead

considerable amount of mucin is present 
It can be removed by acidifying with acetic

It is important that unne to be tested

methods do not suffice the urine can 
usually be cleared by shaking up with a

^Bence Jones Protein 

In 1847 Henry Bence Jones descnbed a 
protein in the unne that had peculiar char 
actensucs It was precipitated by mtnc 
acid but was soluble in boiling water and 
again was precipitated when the unne was 
cooled The same solid precipitate soluble 
by heat was formed by adding hjdro- 
chlonc acid but not to such a degree by 
adding strong acetic acid 
/This protein is particularly pathogno 
momc of multiple myeloma Proteins with 
somewhat similar charactenstics have been 
observed in other conditions such as leu 
kemia and osteomalacia and eien in 
healthy young persons with high blood 
pressure There is a wefT foandecf opinion 
however that true Bence Jones protein 
may not be found m any condition other 
than multiple myeloma Jacobson and 
Milner (1944) defined Bence Jones pro 
tern as a urinary protein that exhibits the 
characteristics originally descnbed by Jones 
They called the similar heat-coagulable sub 
stance found m other conditions “pseudo- 
Bence Jones protem ” They also pomted 
out that many of the more recent tests for 
the Bence Jones protein are applicable to 
proteose and positive results have led to 
the faulty conclusion that Bence Jones pro 
tein IS present in the unne in several other 
diseases than multiple myeloma They de 
vised an excellent scheme for the defection 
of unnary proteins and for the identifica 
tion of Bence Jones protein pseudo-Bence 
Jones protein nucleoprotem heat coagu 
lable protein and proteose The reader is 
referred to the onginal article for the rea 


sons given by these authors for the vanous 
steps in their scheme The following ab- 
breviated form gives the essential steps for 
the identification of the substances and 
especially for the proof that true Bence 
Jones protein is present 

1 Filter a fresh sample of unne and 
perform a ring test with cold concentrated 
mtnc acid If this is negative Bence Jones 
protem is absent 

2 If this test is positive perform a ring 
test with cold concentrated hydrochloric 
acid If this is negaUve Bence Jones protein 
IS absent If It is positive and if the nng 
test with mtnc acid reveals a trace or more 
(above 0 40 per cent) of protein dilute to 
a small trace with fresh normal protein 
free unne 

3 Acidify 5 ml of the onginal or diluted 
unne with 25 per cent acetic acid to pH 5 
(as tested with nitrazine paper) and let 
stand for five mmutes If a precipitate 
forms nucleoprotem is present Filtei 
through fine filter paper 

4 Warm the filtrate or the unfiltered 
unne if there was no precipitate in stop 3 
in a water bath at 70® C for fifteen mm 
utes If the unne remains clear Bence 
Jones protem is absent 

5 If a coagulum forms heat the same 
sample in a water bath at the boilmg point 
for ten minutes If the coagulum dissolves 
Bence Jones protem is present 

6 If the coagulum does not dissolve 
add 0 1 ml of concentrated nitnc acid to 
each cubic centimeter of the sample and 
beat at the boihng point for ten zmnutes 
If the coagulum dissolves Bence Jones pro- 
letn IS present 

7 If the coagulum does not dissolve 
proceed with another sample of urme from 
the beginmng through step 4 Centnfuge 
until the coagulum settles pour off and 
save the supernatant fluid 

8 Suspend the precipitate in 5 ml of

3 Heat to Mgorous boilmg keep at 
this temperature for one or two minutes 
and allow to cool slowly 

In the presence of dextrose the entire 
body of the solution vnU be filled with a 
precipitate which may be red or yellow 
A small amount of yellow precipitate m 
the blue reagent may appear to be green 
When only traces of dextrose are present 
(less than 0 3 per cent) the precipitate 
may appear only on coohng In the absence 
of dextrose the solution remains clear or 
shows only a faint bluish precipitate owing 
to the presence of urates The long boilmg 
is mconvement especially when there is 
much bumping in the tube It will therefore 
generally be found more satisfactory par 
ticularly when a large number of specimens 
of unne must be tested to place the tubes 
m a water bath which is kept at the boilmg 
pomt for five minutes 

Recording Results of Qualitative 
Tests Unless a quantitative estimation is 
made sugar is generally reported simply 
as present" or “absent ” If it is desired 
when recording a posiu^e result of this 
test to comey some idea of the quantity 
of sugar present the following scheme is 
suggested 

1ST (shght trace) No reduction is 
evident during boding for two minutes with 
S or 10 d^ps of unne but signs of reduc 
tion appear after cooling 

2 T (trace) With 8 drops of unne the 
reaction occurs after bodmg for about one 
nunute 

3 M A (moderate amount) WiihyS or 
10 drops of unne the reaction occurs after 
boding for 10 or 15 seconds 

4 L A (large amount) Reduction oc 
curs almost immediately after adding 2 
drops of unne to the bodmg reagent 

Omng to the many vanable factors it is 
impossible to set down with any degree of 
accuracy the percentages of dextrose 
covered by the four terms 

Commercially Available Tests An 
important contnbution to unnalysis has 
been reahzed m the deielopment of several 
commercially a\ ailable reagents for certam 
of the chemical tests One of the eaihest 
and most \aluable of these has been the 
Chnitest tablets (Ames Company) for de 
termination of urine sugar These tablets 
are convenient to use mexpensive and as 
accurate as the Benedict test In more 
recent times there has been increasmg 
interest in tests that are specific for glu 
cose These tests do not respond to the 
\anous nonglucose reducing substances m 


urine since they are based on the enzy 
matic conversion of glucose to gluconic 
acid by the specific glucose oxidase These 
tests commercially avadable as Chmstix 
(Ames) and TesTape (Eh Lilly) have 
proved satisfactory for glucose detection ui 
the routine urinalysis 

y Qtinntilaliie test for dextrose On rare 
occasions it may be desirable to determine 
the exact quantity of dextrose excreted over 
a period of time Should the urine contain 
much dextrose it must be dduted before 
making any quanutative test allowance 
being made for the dilution in the subse- 
quent calculation Albumin if present 
must be removed by acidifying a consider 
able quantity of urine wath acetic acid 
boiling and filtermg Any water lost dunng 
the boilmg should be replaced before filter

JCenilose. Leiulose, or fruit sugar, is 
seldom present in urine except in associa- 
tion with dextrose 

Qimh/ofn'e tests for Inndose. Levulose 
responds to all the tests that ha\e been 
desenbed for dextrose It may be dis 
tmguished from dextrose by the following 
test 

Borchardt's Test Mix about 5 ml 
each of the urine and 25 per cent hydro- 
chloric acid (concentrated HCl. 2 parts 
water, 1 part) m a test tube and add a few 
crystals of resorcinol Heat to boding and

appears Cool the mixture in running water, 
pour into a beaker, and render slightly 
alkaline with sobd sodium or potassium 
hydroxide Return to the test tube, add 2 
or 3 ml of acetic ether, and shake If 
levulose is present, the ether will be colored 
yellow A similar yellow color will follow 
administration of rhubarb and senna 

^(luattliMfi'e tests for lei'ulose The 
methods used for the quantitative deter 
mination of levulose are the same as those 
used for dextrose. 25 ml of Benedict's 
quantitative solution is reduced by 0 053 
gm of levulose 

Lactose Lactose, or milk sugar, is some 
times present m the unne of nursing 
women and in that of women who have 
recently had a miscarriage It Is of interest 
chiefly because it may be mistaken for 
dextrose It is not fermented by yeast but 
reduces copper. 0 0G7G gra of lactose will 
reduce 25 ml of Benedict’s quaniuativc 
solution In strong solution it can form 
Crystals with phcnylhydrazinc. but it is 
extremelj unlikely to do so when the test 
IS applied directly to the urine 

/Jiifmer’i test To about 10 ml of urine 
add 2 or 3 gm of lead acetate, shake well 
and filler into a test tube Boil the filtrate, 
add 1 or 2 ml of strong ammonia water, 
and heat again If lactose is present, the 
solution turns brick red and a red precipi- 
tate will separate The precipiiatc is the 
criterion of the test Dextrose products a 


red solution and a yellow precipitate 
'-^laltosc. Maltose and canc sugar arc of 
bttle or no clinical importance MaUo«:c has 
been found along wath dextrose in cases of 
diabetes It reduces copper. 0 074 gm of 
maltose will reduce 25 ml of Benedict’s 
soluuon Cane sugar (sucrose) is some- 
times added to the unne by malingering 
patients It does not reduce copper, hence 
when It has been added it passes unrcc 
ognized by the physician who uses the 
copper tests only Both maltose and sucrose 
are fermentable bv yeast 
,'l*entosts Pentoses arc so named because 
tlye ipolccule contains five atoms of carbon 
Vegetable gums form their chid source

Pentosuria is uncommon It has been 
noted after ingestion of large quantities of 
pentrose rich substances such as cherries 
plums and fruit juices It is said to be 
fairly constant among habitual users of 
morphine An obscure chronic form of pen 
tosuria which does not cause clinical svmp 
toms has been observed and occurs most 
commonly among Jews The pentose ex 
creted in such cases is believed to be op 
tically inactive arabinose, although ribosc

v/Acitonf Domrs 

Acetone bodies arc closely related sub 
stances — acetone, di.acetic add and beta 
oxybutyric acid— -which apparentiv origin 
ate in the liver Excessive protluctlon of 
diacciic and oxybutrlc acids wiihin tlic fxxfv 
leads by virtue of (heir .acid nature to the 
condition known as add Intoxication Since 
acetone bodies arc ketones this form of 
acidosis is sometimes given the special name 
•Lctosis " Tlie existence of this condition or. 
rather the icndcncv toward It (sino there 
may be moderate accionuria wlihout defm- 



36 Clinical Diagnosis by 

ite aadosis) is shown by the presence of 
acetone bodies in the iinne When the con 
dition IS very mild acetone occurs alone 
as the acidosis becomes more severe di 
acetic acid and beta-oxybutync acid are also 
present 

The occurrence of these ketones is asso 
ciated with the amount of a\ailable ^yco- 
gen in the hver When the amount of avail 
able glycogen is reduced as in starvation or 
diabetes melhtus an mcrease m the oxida 
tion of fatty acids occurs m turn causing 
an accelerated rate of formation of ketone 
bodies m the hver and consequent ketosis 
If there is an adequate reserve of hver 
glycogen the rate of fat metabohsm and 
therefore the rate of formation of ketone 
bodies apparently cannot become increased 
sufficiently to cause ketosis According to 
this physiologic concept it seems that “the 
yflames of carbohydrate mhibit those of fat 
and that fats do not "bum m the flames 
of carbohydrate" as was formerly thought 

Acetone Traces of acetone that cannot 
be detected by the ordinary tests may be 
present in the unne under normal con 
ditions Larger amounts may be present 
when the intake of carbohydrate is limited 
and in fever or gastrointestinal disturb- 
ances 

Acetonuna finds its chief clinical impoi 
tance in connection with diabetes mellitus 
It occurs mtermittentl} m some cases m 
which the ^sease is mild and fauly reg 
ularly m cases in which the disease is ad 
vanced although much depends on the 
diet It is always present in cases in which 
the disease is severe Tests for acetone are 
fully as important as tests for sugar in 
A progressive increase as tcieas 
ured by the response to qualitative tests 
is a grave prognostic sign since acidosis 
that IS due to the acetone bodies is prob- 
ably the chief cause of the dreaded dia 
betic coma Acetonuna can be diminished 
temporarily by more hberal allowance of 
carbohjdrates in the diet 

Acetonuna due to any cause is hable to 
be especially severe in children and this 
doubtless plays an important part m acute 
and chronic diseases of childhood es 
pecially m those requinng a restncted diet 
In fact the unne of a con«lderable per 
centage of young children contains appie 
ciable quanUties of acetone under normal 
condiuons

Ing of the tissues which is known as ic- 
terus or jaundice Small amounts of bile 
may however be found in the unne when 
the disturbance is not severe enough to 
produce recognizable jaundice or in other 
cases before the jaundice supervenes 
Icterus is generally caused by obstruction 
to the outflow of bde from the hver owing 
to diseases affecting the hepauc paren 
chyma or to conditions that obstruct the 
external bilnry ducts A less common but 
important cause is an excessive production 
of bilirubin associated with pathologically 
increased destruction of erythrocytes 
•^Tests for Bile Pigment Bile pigment 
gives the urine a greenish yellow yellow 
or brown color which after shaking is im 
parted to the foam Cells casts and other 
structures in the sediment may be stained 
brown or yellow This however should not 
be accepted as proof of the presence of 
bile without further tests

Reagents 

1 Fouchets reagent Prepare a 09 per 
cent solution of feme chloride in a 25 per 
cent solution of trichloracetic acid 

2 Banum impregnated paper stnps 
Thoroughly soak pieces of extra thick filter 
paper (Schleicher and Schull no 470) in a 
saturated aqueous solution of barium chlor 
ide Dry in the air or preferably in a dr> 
ing o\en Cut the impregnated paper into 
strips 4 inches long by ^ inch wide 

Technique 

1 Place one end of the banum im 
pregnated paper in the sample of unne to 
be tested At least half the stnp should 
extend above the surface of the sample of 
unne Allow it to stand in the unne for 
thirty seconds to two minutes Withdraw 
the stnp and place it on a piece of absorb 
ent paper 

2 In that area corresponding to the 
surface of the unne there is generally more 
color Place 2 or 3 drops of Fouchets rc 
agent directly on this area A positive re 
action IS denoted by the appearance of a 
green color which vanes in intensit) with 
the amount of bilirubin present 

•^Urobilinogen and Urobilin 

When bilirubin of the bile reaches the 
intestinal tract it is reduced b) the action 
of bactena to colorless chromogens col 
lectively referred to as urobilinogen A con 
siderable proportion probably as much as 
50 per cent of the urobilinogen is reab- 
sorbed from the intestine and earned to the 
liver in the portal blood The remainder m 
the intestine in part oxidized to the orange 
or brown pigments known as urobilin 
passes out with the feces Under norma] 
conditions reabsorbed urobilinogen is al 
most complete!) metabolized in the liver or 
excreted with the bile Minute amounts 
that escape into the s>stemic circulation 
account for the normal urinary excretion 
X)f 0 5 to 4 mg of urobilinogen in 24 hours 
\Mien liver cells are damaged urobilinogen 
maj not be removed cfTcctlvcly from the 
portal blood thus allowing an abnormally 
large amount to reach the general circu 
lation and to be excreted b) the kidneys 
On the other hand if the bile ducts are 
completely obstructed so that no bilirubin 
enters the intestine the formation of uro- 
blUpogcn ceases and the unne (and feces 
as well) may contain diminished or im 
perceptible amounts of the chromogens 


Laeoratorv Mftmods 

Whenever excessive destrucuon of hemo- 
globin causes increased formation of hili 
rubm and hence an increased production 
of urobilinogen in the intestine there may 
also be abnormally large amounts of uro- 
bilinogen excreted m the unne When not 
due to excessive destruction of blood in 
creased excretion of urobilinogen in the 
unne usually indicates functional inca 
pacity of the liver Its recognition is simple 
and has considerable practical usefulness 
as for example in the diagnosis of acute 
hepatitis m judging the amount of damag- 
done to the liver parenchyma by poisons 
and m the chronic congestion of poorly 
compensated heart disease The unnary 
and fecal excretion of urobibnogen is an 
aid in distinguishing the anemns assod 
ated with excessive destruction of blood 
(hemolytic anemias) from those due to 
other causes (iron defici ncy anemia 
aplastic anemia and so on) -Absence of 
urobilinogen from tlie urine is character 
istic of complete biliary obstruction al 
though in this instance the disapf>carance 
of bile pigments from the feces is likely 
to have more dchnitc diagnostic slgnlfi 
cance 

To be of value tests for urobilinogen in 
the urine should be made on several sue 
ccssive days since the chromogen may be 
absent for a day or two without demonstra 
blc cause It IS also essential that the test 
be made immediately after passage of the 
unne or that proper conditions of pascr 
vation be observed meticulously If there 
is to be any significant delay in performance 
of the test as when 24 hour specimens an 
being examined the unne must be collected 
m dark bottles or othenvise protected from 
light and it must be alkahnizcd it all 
limes The latter condition is easily ar 
ranged by having a few grams of calcium 
carbonate in the bottle before tlic collection 
is begun If these precautions arc not ob- 
served urobilinogen will be quickly oxl 
dized to urobilin and i false negative lest 
will be reported

lution in which a faint pink color appears 
IS recorded as the end pomt The urine of 
a normal individual is expected to show 
color production at dilutions of 1 8 to I 32 
If the pink color can be defected only in 
the undiluted unne or in unne diluted 1 2, 
urobilinogen is considered to be decreased 
A positive reaction at dilutions of 1 64 or 
greater represents increased urinary excre- 
tion of urobihnogen 

If the urine contains bile, it should be 
treated with equal parts of 10 per cent 
aqueous solution of bqnum chlonde and 
filtered through hard paper before this test 
IS undertaken This procedure removes bill 
rubm, which othenvise may interfere with 
reading of the urobilinogen results "nie 
dilution introduced by this step must be 


taken into account in setting up the senes 
of tubes for the test 

Qualitative Test for Urohilm Only 
traces of urobihn are present in fresh nor 
mail unne It is now customary and much 
more simple to examine the unne for uro 
bilmogen either as a freshly voided speci 
men or under conditions that obviate the 
loss of urobilinogen by oxidation Since 
there are occasional instances when a qual 
native test for urobihn may be useful the 
technique of Schlesmger is given in detail 

ScMestnger’s Test for Urobihn 
Reagents 

1 Compound solution of iodine (Lu 
gol’s iodine solution) 

2 A saturated alcoholic solution of zinc 
acetate or zinc chlonde 

3 A 10 per cent solution of calcium 
chloride 

Technique 

1 If bile pigment is present, it should 
be removed by adding about a fifth the 
volume of calcium chloride solution to tbe 
unne and filtering 

2 Place 30 ml of filtered unne m a test 
tube and add a few drops of compound so 
lution of iodine 

3 Add 10 ml of saturated alcoholic 
solution of zme acetate A greenish fluor- 
escence, best seen when the tube is viewed 
m bnght sunlight against a black back 
ground and when the light is concentrated 
on It with a fens, shows the presence of 
urobilin The fluorescence becomes more 
marked after an hour or two 

/Hemoglobin 

The presence m the unne of hemoglobin 
or pigments directly denved from it, ac 
compamed by few, if any. erythrocytes, 
constitutes hemoglobiniina It must be dis 
tinguished from hematuria or blood in the 
unne, which is a commoner condition In 
both conditions chemical tests will reveal 
hemoglobin, but in hematuria microscopic 
examination wiU reveal the presence of 
erythrocytes The presence of considerable 
amounts of hemoglobin imparts a reddish 
or brown color to the urine, and there may 
occur a sediment of brown, granular pig 
ment

Pus adds a certain amount of albumin 
to the urme and it is often desirable to 
know whether the albumin m a gi\en spcci 
men is due solely to pus It has been esti 
mated that 80 000 to 100 000 pus cor 
puscles per cubic millimeter add about 
0 1 per cent of albumin If albumin is 
present in much greater proportion than 
tins the excess is probably derhed from 
the kidney , . , . 

/ Erythrocytes Unne that contains blood 
is always albuminous Very small amounts 
of blood do not alter its macroscopic ap 
pcarance but larger amounts alter it con

osls ntid cells Thomas Addis and his asso- 
aates (1950) have developed a method for 
he quantitative estimation of formed de

his method have helped to formulate im 
lortant basic principles cont.eming the ex 
a'eUon of formed elements in health and 
hsease Perhaps the most valuable comn 
mtion of this work has been to emphasize 
ihe importance of a properly conducted 
microscopic examination of the urinary 
sediment The method is now seldom used 
in practical clinical work It has unusual 
teaching value and it can be recommended 
as a part of any curriculum leading to an 
understanding of renal disease or a lech 
meal mastery of urinalysis 
Technique 

3 Save a 12 hour sample of unne which 
must be measured to within :t 2 ml 

2 Transfer 10 ml of unne to a spe- 
cial graduated centrifuge tube (Fig 3-16) 
The narrow tip is graduated for the measur 
ing of smiU amounts of sediment 

3 Centrifuge for five minutes at 1800 
revolutions per minute 

' 4 Pour off the supernatant unne and 

adjust the volume of the remaining fluid 
‘with physiologic salt solution (1 to 5 ml ) 
so that the sediment from the 10 ml of 
urme will be vvell distnbuted in the fluid 
by mixing thoroughly with a fine pipet 

5 Place a drop of the mixture of sedi 
‘ment in a hemacytometer and count the 
• number of casts in the total ruled area 
•which represents the number m 0 0009 ml 
I Also count the erythrocytes and the leuko- 
■cytes that are found in the same ruled area 





use lube 


Repeat this procedure two to ten times and 
add the number of cells and casts that Jiave 
been counted 

Calculation Tlie following formula 
IS self-explaining Let V = volume of unne 
expressed In cubic centimeters for 12 
hours 10 = number of milliliters of unne 
centrifuged s — volume in milliliters of 
mixed sediment v = volume in milUliters 
m which count vvas made n = total num 
ber of cells or casts counted N = number 
of casts or cells in 12 hour sample 


Normal Values and Significancf 
Hyaline casts normally may number as 
high as 5000 m the 12 hour period al 
though m cases of nephritis the casts of 
various sorts may totil 50 000 to 1 000 000 
Erythrocytes normally number from 0 to 
500 000 (possibly even 1000 000) in 
nephntis there may be an enormous in 
crease in the number of erythrocytes in 
the 12 hour penod (15 000 000 to 400 000 
000) Leukocytes may be present normally 
usually the number of leukocytes does not 
exceed 1,000 000 in twelve hours In patho- 
logic conditions the epithelial cells and pus 
corpuscles mav number from 2 000 000 to 
50 000 000 It is evident that with such 
wide variations in normal subjects a dose 
division between normal and abnormal is 
impossible 

Lyttlc (1933) has shown that the urine 
of children may normally contain slightly 
more albumin and casts than the unne of 
adults The number of erythrocytes and 
leukocytes In the unne excreted in 12 hours 
by a normal child will be slightly less on 
the average than the number of erythro- 
cytes and leukocytes In the unne excreted 
in a similar period by adults 

Spcrmnozoa Spermatozoa arc generally 
present in the unne of men after nocturnal 
emissions after epileptic convulsions and 
in spermatorrhea They may be found in 
the unne of both sexes after coitus They 
are easily recognized by their characteristic 
structure (Fig 3-17) The 4 mm objective 
should be used with subdued hglit and care 
fill focusing 

Bacteria Under normal conditions the 
unne is free from bacteria in the bladder 
but becomes contaminated in passing 
through the umbra Various nonpatho- 
genic bacteria arc present in decomposing 
unne Tliey are easily seen vslih the 4 mm 
objective in the routine microscopic exam 
inauon but ordinarily no attcmpi is made

CvLiNDRoros This name is someiunes 
given to the mucous threads just descnbed

They resemble hyalme casts in structure 
but differ in that they taper to a slender 
tail which IS often twisted or curled on 
Itself (Fig 3-12) They frequently occur

Masses of Urates Phosphates or 
Minute Crystals Masses of amorphous 
urates phosphates or nunute crystals (Fig

form or shreds of mucus covered wth 
granules may closely resemble granular 
casts The gentle appbcation of heat or 
appropriate chemicals will distinguish them 
from casts When unne contains both 
mucus and granules large numbers of 
these “pseudocasts all lying m the same 
direction can be produced by moving the 
coverglass slightly from side to side It is

Pus adds a certain amount of albumin 
to the urine, and Jt is often desirable to 
know whether the albumin in a given speci 
men is due solely to pus It has been esti 
mated that 80 000 to 100 000 pus cor 
puscles per cubic millimeter add about 
0 1 per cent of albumin If albumin is 
present in much greater proporuon than 
this, the excess is probably derived from 
the kidney 

/ Lr}throc:)tcs Unne that contains blood 
is always albuminous Very small amounts 
of blood do not alter its macroscopic ap 
pearance, but larger amounts alter it con 
siderabl) Blood from the kidneys is gen- 
erally mixed intimately with the unne and 
gives It a hazy reddish or brou-n ‘smoky" 
color When blood comes from the lower 
part of the urinary tract, it is not so in 
timatefy mixed wi'tA the unne and settles 
more quickly to the bottom the color Is 
brighter, and small clots are often present 
A further clue to the site of the bleeding 
may sometimes be gamed by having the 
patient void three separate portions If the 
blood is chiefly in the first portion the 
bleedmg point Is probably in the urethra. 
If the blood is chiefi) in the last portion 
the bleeding point is probablj in the blad 
der If the blood is mixed uniformly in all 
three portions It probably comes from the 
kidney or ureter Tlie presence of tube casts 
or considerable numbers of cpicbchal cells 
of the renal type would be suggestive, and 
the presence of blood casts would of course 
point dcfinitcl) to hemorrhage into the 
renal tubules 

Erythrocytes usually are not difficult to 
recognize with the microscope Since fat, 
yeasts, and oxalate crystals may cause con- 


fusion. erythrocytes should be identiRed 
positively by examining them with the high 
power, dry objective When very fresh, they 
have a normal appearance and arc ydlon 
ish disks of uniform size They arc likcl) 
to be swollen in dilute urine and crenated 
in conceniraied urine When they have 
been in the urine any considerable Utne, 
their hemoglobin may be dissolved they 
then appear as faint colorless circles or 
'shadow cells' and are more diflicuh to see 
(Fig 3-15) The shadow cells are not al 
ways uniform in size and, although usually 
circular, may be oval, pear shaped, or ii 
regular in outline The microscopic findincs 
may be corroborated by chemical tests for 
hemoglobin although the microscope niav 
show a few erythrocytes when the chemical 
tests are negative \Vhen the erythrocytes 
are numerous they are often accompanied 
by yellowish shreds of fibrin of vanous 
sizes 

When not the result of contamination 
from menstrual discharge, blood in the 
unne, or hematuria is always a pathologic 
condition and usually is of serious import 
A few erythrocytes may be found in tht 
unne after strenuous exercise Blood comci 
from the renal tubules in severe hjiicT 
cmia, in acute nephritis in exacerbation? 
of chronic nephritis, in renal tuberculos’s 
and in malignant disease Renal hcmaturii 
may also be a manifestation of the hemor 
rhagic disease 

Blood comes from the pelvis of the kid 
ney in the presence of renal calculus cl 
which hematuna is the classic and mosi 
constant sjTnptom The bleeding in thli 
condition usually is intermittent, small in 
amoiml, and accompanied bv a little pui 
and perhaps crystals of the substance form-

Quantifitnc Estimation of Orgmwed 
Sediments AthUs" «icf/iod o/ roiniting 
fflfts mid cells Thomas Addis and his asso- 
ciates (1950) hase deseloped a method for 
the quantitatise estimation of formed ele 
ments in the unne Extensive studies using 
this method have helped to formulate im 
portant basic principles concerning the ex 
cretion of formed elements in health and 
disease Perhaps the most valuable contn 
bution of this wort has been to emphasize 
the importance of a properly conducted 
microscopic exammation of the urinary 
sediment The method is now seldom used 
in practical clinical work It has unusual 
teaching value and it can be recommended 
as a part of any curriculum leading to an 
understandmg of renal disease or a tech 
nical mastery of urinalysis 
Technique 

1 Save a 12 hour sample of urine which 
must be measured to within 2 ml 

2 Transfer 10 ml of unne to a spe* 
cial graduated centrifuge tube (Fig 3-16) 
The narrow tip is graduated for the measur 
mg of small amounts of sediment 

3 Centrifuge for five minutes nt 1800 
revolutions per minute 

4 Pour off the supernatant unne and 
adjust the volume of the remaining fluid 
with physiologic salt solution (1 to 5 ml ) 
so that the sediment from the 10 ml of 
unne will be well distnbuted in the fluid 
by mixing thoroughly vvath a fine pipct 

5 Place a drop of the mixture of sedi 
ment in a hemacytometer and count the 
number of casts in the total ruled area 
which represents the numher in 0 0009 ml 
Also count the e0ihrocytes and the leuko 
cytes that are found in the same ruled area 



a J6 Addis graduated cciUrifuge tube 


Rqieat this procedure two to ten times and 
add the number of cells and casts that have 
been counted 

Calculation The following formula 
IS sclf-explaming Let V = v olume of unne 
expressed in cubic centimcteis for 12 
hours 10 = number of milliliters of unne 
centrifuged s = volume in miUiIiters of 
mixed sediment \ = volume in nullihtors 
In which count was made n total num 
ber of cells or casts counted N = number 
of casts or cells in 12 hour sample 


Normal Values and Significance 
Hyaline casts normally may number as 
high as 5000 m the 12 hour penod al 
though in cases of nephritis the casts of 
various sorts may total 50 000 to I 000 000 
Erythrocytes normally number from 0 to 
500 000 (possibly even 1 000 000) in 
nephritis there may be an enormous in 
crease in the number of erythrocytes In 
the 12 hour penod (15 000 000 to 400 000 
000) Leukoevtes may be present normally 
usually the number of leukocytes does not 
exceed 1 000 000 in twelve hours In patho 
logic conditions the epithelial cells and pus 
coipuscles may number from 2 000 000 to 
50 000 000 It IS evident that with such 
wide variations in normal subjects a close 
divTsion between normal and abnormal is 
impossible 

Lytile (1933) has shown that the unne 
of children may nontially contain slightly 
more albumin ind casts than the unne of 
adults The number of erythrocytes and 
leukocytes in the unne excreted in 12 hours 
by a normal child will be slightly less on 
the average than the number of erythro- 
cytes and leukocytes in the urine excreted 
in a simdar period by adults 

Spermatozoa Spermatozoa arc pencrallv 
present in the unne of men after nocturnal 
emissions after epileptic convulsions and 
in spermatorrhea They mav be found in 
the unne of both sexes after coiius Thev 
are easily recognized by their chinctcristlc 
structure (Fig 3-17) The 4 mm objective 
should bo used with subdued light and care 
ful focusing 

Bacteria Under normal conditions the 
unne IS free from bacteria in the bladder 
but becomes contaminated in passing 
through the urethra Vinous nonpitho- 
genic bactena are present in decomposing 
unne They are easilv seen with the 4 mm 
objective in the routine microscopic exam

general purposes the most satisfaciory of 
the functional tests In addition it has the 
advantage of being readily adapted to the 
observation of function in each kidney 
separately when unne is obtained by ure 
teral catheterization 

Several minor variations of the pro- 
cedure have been proposed The procedure 
to be outlined takes advantage of the im 
portant 15 minute excretion 

1 Give the patient 300 to 400 ml (about 
two glasses) of water to promote urinary 
excretion 

2 Twenty to 30 mmuies later inject in 
travenously exactlj 1 ml of solution con 
taming 6 mg of phenolsulfonphihalein 
The dye can be admimstered intramuscu 
larlj alloning approximately ten minutes 
additional time for absorption The mtra 
venous Injection is preferable since it per 
mils more accurate measurement particu 
larl> at the 15-minute interval 

Note that the patient is not asked to void 
and discard unne at the time the dye is 
injected Quantitative coUcciion of the ex 
creted dye is greatly improved if unne is 
present in the bladder at the time excretion 
begins 

3 Exactl) 15 minutes after the intra 
venous admimstrauon of the dye and 
again at the end of one hour and two 
hours have the patient void completely 
The three specimens are properly labeled 
and kept in separate containers 

4 Estimate the output of phenolsul 
foaphthaiein in each cf the three speci 
mens 

A number of slightly different procedures 
for the estimation of phenolsulfonphtba 
lein can be adapted to any lyiie of colorim 
etry 

1 To prepare a standard place 1 ml 
of P S P solution (6 mg ) in a 1000 ml 
volumetric flask Add 5 ml of 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide to bring out the maxi 
mum red color Dilute to 1000 ml with 
water and mix by invertmg several times 
This is the 100 per cent standard It can 
be diluted with an equal amount of dis 
tilled water to make a 50 per cent stand 
ard The latter is generally used since no 
more than 50 per cent of the injected dye 
is llkelj to be excreted in any one speta 
men 

2 Place each specimen of urine in a 
volumetric flask or graduated cylinder 
Note the amount of each If a specimen Js 
less than 40 ml results arc not dependable 

3 Add to each specimen 5 ml of 10 per 
cent sodium hydroxide to bring out the 


Laboratorv Mfthods 

purplish red color Dilute each with water 
until the color is roughly equivalent to the 
standard If the unne is cloudy. It must be 
filtered before being compared with the 
standard 

Estimauon can be made in any type of 
colorimeter In the absence of a colorimeter 
one can easily make up a senes of stand 
ards representing 10. 20 30 per cent and 
so on by diluting the 100 per cent stand 
ard Standards are also available in com 
mercial kits*, these are quite satisfactory 
for small laboratory work 

In the normal individual, 25 per cent or 
more of the dye will be excreted dunng the 
first 15 minutes after intravenous injection 
and not less than 70 per cent will be ex 
creted dunng the two-hour penod In the 
absence of cardiac decompensation or ob- 
structive uropathy the degree of retention 
IS a fairly accurate guide to the severity of 
impairment of renal function The rate at 
which the dye appears in the urine depends 
both on the renal blood flow and the action 
of the tubular epithelium in removing the 
dye from the blood In the absence of car 
dtac failure the results, especially of the 
15-minute excretion test, correlate rather 
well with measurements of renal blood 
flow Obstrucuve lesions of the lower uri 
nary tract as well as delayed or incomplete 
emptying of the bladder make it impossible 
to interpret the test in terms of renal 
function 

/The Urea Clearance Test The concept 
of rena} clearance can be applied to any 
substance that is present in the blood and 
IS excreted m the unne The principle was 
first applied by Van Slyke to urea Urci 
clearance was defined as the volume 
ol blood (or plasma) containing an amount 
of urea equal to that excreted in one min 
ute Thus clearance is a ratio of the uri 
nary excretion to the average blood level 
determined simultaneously Such a ratio is 
correlated more directly with the progress 
of kidney disease and shows a deviation 
from normal earlier in the course of renal 
damage than any isolated observation of a 
blood constituent or the urinary excretion 
of urea or other substance 

ProceduTe Although not absolutely 
necessary, it is usually best to have the 
patient remain at rest during the test 
period The test should be performed at 
high but falhng rates of urine flow, since 
the onset of water diuresis alters Uie rate 
of urea rcabsorpiion by the tubules Prepa

ration of the patient for urea dearance by 
induction of water diuresis should there 
fore begin an hour or more before the 
unne collections are made 

1 At least one hour before the test is to 
begin gi\e the patient 8 ml of water per 
kilogram of body weight (but not more 
than 600 ml ) 

2 At the beginning of the test the pa 
tient empties his bladder completely, dis 
carding the specimen The tune is recorded 
accurately 

3 In exactly one hour the patient is 
asked to void again Measure the quantity 
of unne exactly in ml and divide by 60 to 
calculate the number of ml pec minute 
(V) 

4 Near the midpoint of the test with 
draw blood by venipuncture and determine 
the value for the urea nitrogen m mg per 
100 mb (B) The exact time is unimpor 
tant, since there is very little fluctuation of 
blood urea over such a short interval 

5 Determine the urea nitrogen content 
of the urine and express as mg per 
100 ml (U) 

Calctilauon The urea clearance is the 
number of ml of blood cleared of urea per 
minute If the quantity of urine voided is 
more than 2 ml per minute the formula 
used IS that for “maximum clearance”

For both technical and physiologic reasons 
maximum clearance is a more reliable fig 
ure than standard clearance 

y Interpreiatwn Results falling between 
75 and 125 per cent of normal have no 
pathologic stgmficance Clearance values 
from 40 to 60 per cent of normal indicate 
moderate functional impaument values 
from 20 to 40 per cent are associated with 
marked impairment Urea clearance Jess 


than 20 per cent of normal indicates severe 
renal damage Since the proportion of urea 
reabsorbed by the renal tubules remains 
relatively constant at about 40 per cent of 
that filtered the urea clearance test serves 
as a measure of glomerular filtration The 
urea clearance expressed as a per cent of 
normal multiplied by 1 2 is a rough dm 
ical estimation of glomerular filtration rite 
Other Clearance Tests The measurement 
of endogenous creatinine clearance has 
been advocated rather widely Creaimme 
clearance approaches the glomerular fdtra 
tion rate but the situation is complicated 
m the human because a proportion of the 
creatinine is secreted in the tubules This 
proportion rises somewhat unpredictably 
when failure of filtration occurs in renal 
disease This fundamental defect is not 
corrected by the use of specific enzymauc 
methods for the measurement of creati 
nine 

Several more specific tests of renal func 
non have been based on the clearance 
principle For the most part these require 
intravenous infusion of test substances at 
constant rates catheterization and a rela 
mely compheated laboratory facihty They 
are time consuming and costly VVe are 
generall> satisfled to use the results of 
these more refined methods as a back 
ground against which the more simple and 
practical methods can be interpreted 
The glomerular filtration rate can be 
estimated by determining the clearance of 
any substance that is filtered freely at the 
glomerulus but that is neither excreted nor 
reabsorbed by the tubules A nearly ideal 
substance for this purpose is inuhn an inert 
polysaccharide The normal glomerular 
filtration rale as determined by mulin 
clearance is about 110 to 150 ml per 
mmute 

Renal blood flow can be determined by 
I using such substances as DJodrast and 
/ para aminohippuric acid which at low 
blood concentrations are removed almost 
completely by tubular excretion m a single 
circulation through the kidney Effective 
renal blood flow as calculated from this 
type of clearance procedure is about 1000 
to 1150 ml per minute or expressed as 
plasma flow about 600 to 700 ml per 
minute 

The specific determination of tubular 
funcuon is somewhat more involved Tubu

DISE.VSES or THE kIDNE\ 

A few of the more common forms of 
renal diseases will be discussed briefly The 
descriptions are intended only to illustrate 
the manner in which clinical laboratory 
procedures can aid in the diagnosis and 
treatment of these conditions A full pres 
entation in this category of diseases is be 
jond the scope of our present purpose The 
student will find adequate material m the 
references at the end of this chapter (refs 
2 4 15 and 16) 

Acute Glomerulonephritis This is a dif 
fuse inflammatory disease of the kidneys 
imolving primarily the capillary endothe 
hum and other elements of the glomerulus 
The kidney tissues are not actually invaded 
by bactena The disease appears rather to 
be a delayed possibly allergic response to 
antecedent not concurrent infection The 
infection which precedes the nephritic epi 
sode by 10 to 20 days is usually localized 
in the upper respiratory tract Frequent ex 
amples are tonsillitis pharyngitis sinu 
sitls scarlet fever and rheumatic fever 
The infection is caused by hemolytic strep 
tococci of the Lancefield group A The pa 
tient may complain of swelling of the face 
and hands headache oliguria and hema 
turia In more severe cases edema becomes 
generalized hypertension severe and dysp 
nea marieo’ Anorexia vomiting fever 
visual disturbances delirium nitrogen re 
tention and coma are manifestations m 
fatal cases The disease is seldom encoun 
tered m the fully developed and classical 
form We must recognize the possibihly of 
glomerulonephritis when mild or transient 
signs occur In many cases the typical un 
nary findings appear in patients who pre 
sent no history or physical findings truly 
characteristic of the disease 

Urtnalym The volume of unne may 
remain normal IVhen oliguria does occur 
it is a grave prognostic sign usually indi 
eating severe renal damage A period of 
anuria two to four days is not inconsistent 
with recovery but often marks the fatal 
case Actual renal msufirciency does not 
occur dunng the acute disease and conse 
qucntly the specific gravity of the unne is 
normal or increased The urine is deeply 


Lxboratory Methods 

colored and often has a smoky appearance 
owing to the presence of red cells Hema 
tuna IS so typical that the disease was once 
referred to as hemorrhagic Brights disease 
Red cells in the unne are often the first 
abnormality to appear and the last to dis 
appear during healing Gross hematuna oc 
curs m approximately 40 per cent of cases 
Failure to find red cells in the unne would 
place considerable doubt upon the diagnosis 
of glomerulonephritis 

Protein is regularly present in the unne 
but the amount vanes widely A moderate 
number of white cells appear in the sedi 
ment but frank pus is not seen ^Vhen 
they can be found red cell casts are par 
ticularly convincing evidence of glomeru 
lonephniis Hyalme and granular casts may 
be present in the early stages of the dis 
ease and waxy and fatty casts appear 
somewhat later 

Since vomiting and refusal of food are 
common features of acute glomerulonephn 
us ketonuna is often encountered This 
finding bears no essential relation to the 
disease itself but it is an important danger 
signal indicating that precautions must be 
taken against further development of aci 
dosis dehydration or carbohydrate starva 
tion 

Kidney function tests In at least half 
the patients with acute glomerulonephntis 
renal function as measured by the usual 
tests IS normal In other patients there are 
varying degrees of renal failure that can 
be estimated by the urea clearance and the 
PSP excreuon tests Renal insufficiency 
with nitrogen retention and termmation m 
urenua is decidedly uncommon only 2 or 
3 per cent of cases follow tfifs course 
Hypertensive encephalopathy with convul 
sions and coma may occur m acute glo 
merulonephritis without significant azo- 
temia 

Blood counts A normochromic normo* 
cytic anemia occurs in many patients It 
may occur in the absence of nitrogen re 
tention but is most marked when the non 
protein nitrogen is elevated The white cell 
count is usually not altered significantly 
unless there is an associated infection 

Blood nonprotetu nitrogen Severe 
azotemia occurs in less than 5 per cent of 
cases The discovery of marked nitrogen 
retention early in the course should lead 
one to suspect that chrome nephritis has 
been established previously and that the 
present episode is an acute exacerbation 

Other observations Durmg the acute 
attack the serum complement ma> be low

and the antistreptolysin titer high Serum

tion IS a special challenge to laboratory

often dominate the clinical picture ~ 
r7nm7l)ii5 Drihe findings are essen 
tial to the diagnosis but they vary widely 
depending upon the activity of the disease 
and the stage to which it has progressed 
Small amounts of protein and a few casts 
may for many years be the only evidence 
of abnormality Red cells are found in the 
sediment iniemiUtently and in important 
relation to the degree of activity Hema 
tuna either gross or microscopic Is always 
a grave sign during the course of the dls 
case Patients in whom the nephrotic phase 
occurs may excrete large amounts of pro- 
tein with few or no red cells 

As the disease progresses the volume of 
urine becomes greater Its specific gravity 
shows a diminishing fluctuation and finally 
becomes fixed between I 008 and 1 012 
When this point has been reached the ex 
cretion of cells and protein may be de 
creased stnkmgly 

The most typical urine findings in 
chrome glomerulonephritis are continued 
proteinuria of variable degree intermittent 
hematuria and progressive failure of con 
centration and dilution 

htdtiey ftmcftoti tests These pro^e 
dures have ^ir greatest usefulness in the 
study of chronic ladney disease They may 
indicate the presence of renal insufficiency 
before nitrogen retention occurs they serve 
to estimate the degree of functional insuffi 
aency and the extent of renal damage A 
concentration test is usually run first After 
fixation of the specific gravity has taken 
place this test yields no further iniorma 
non concerning the progress of kidney dis 
ease Thereafter a urea clearance test os 
most valuable m estimating further loss of 
excretory efficiency until nitrogen retention 
becomes marked Because of its simplicity 
the PSP test may be used during this 
period of observation but it does not have 
the accuracy of the urea clearance method 
With the approach of uremia blood chem 
ical abnormalities appear and may be used 
to follow the further course of events 


Blood couuts Moderate to severe ane 
mia IS found regularly in chronic glomeru 
lonephritis The degree of anemia is often 
said to parallel the nitrogen retention but 
there are many exceptions to this rule In 
most Cases the anemia is of the microcytic 
hypochromic type In some cases there is 
a general hematopoietic arrest resulting in 
severe anemia leukopenia and thrombo 
cytopema This situation is often charac 
tenzed mistakenly as aplastic anemia or 
even thrombocytopenic purpura before the 
underlying renal disease is discovered 
Tlic Nephrotic Syndrome The term 
“nephrosis" was invented for a group 
diseases supposed to be of degenerative 
origm and jhus not properly called nephn 
tis or inflammatory The concept of ne 
phrosis has over the years become quite 
confused In current usage the term ne 
phroiic syndrome does not commit us to 
any definite concept of renal disease The 
syndrome is characterized chiefly by mas 
sive proteinuria retention of sodium hypo 
proteinemia and massive edema The ne 
phrotic syndrome occurs m association 
with kidney lesions of such widely different 
etiologies as chronic glomerulonephntis 
tntercapillary glomerular sclerosis or Kiin 
nvelsticl Wilson syndrome amyloidosis of 
the kidney syp^itic nephrosis thrombosis 
of the renal vein and disseminated lupus 
erythematosus Chrome glomerulonephritis 
is the pathologic basis for the nephrotic 
syndrome m a large proportion of cases 
The so called true or hpoid nephrosis is 
described as occurring prmcipally in chil 
dren It is doubtful that this can be dis 
tinguisbtd from the nephrotic phase of 
glomerular nephritis 

Urmalysts The volume of iinne is 
small the specific gravity is normal or 
high The excretion of chloride is low dur 
mg the formation or presence of edema 
The unne always contains a large quantity 
of protein with daily 'e^etions of 5 to 
20 gm being noted There is no other con 
dition in which the loss of protein m the 
urine is so great Hyahne casts may occur 
in large numbers Occasionally there are a 
few or many white cells but red cells do 
not appear Continued absence of hema 
tuna IS an important point in the exclusion 
of active glomerular nephritis Doubly re 
fractile lipoid bodies are seen in the urinary 
sediment especially in the so^alled true 
lipoid nephrosis 

Plasma protems The plasma protem 
disturbance is characterized by a marked

CuMCAi Diagnosis bs Laboratory Methods 


hjpoalbummemia The total globulins are 
increased in the alpha and beta fractions, 
and there is a decrease in the gamma glob- 
ulins The total protein and the albumin 
fraction are below the critical level for 
edema formation, that is, the total is less 
than 4 5 gm and the albumin less than 
2 5 gm per 100 ml The protein levels are 
of great importance in ^agnosis in the 
estimation of prognosis and in determin- 
ing the response to therapy 

Wood cholesterol There is a general 
increase in the blood lipids with strikingly 
high levels of both free and estenfied 
cholesterol and phospholipid fractions 
The plasma often appears milky The de- 
termination of blood cholesterol is a satis 
factory mdex to the total lipemia Values 
for cholesterol concentrauon are usually m 
excess of 300 mg per 100 ml , and levels 
above 1000 rag have been reported 

Blood uren and tionproletii titlrogeit 
These determmations are usually within 
normal limits, although slight to moderate 
azotemia does not exclude the diagnosis 

Plasma chlortde Chloride concentra 
tion in the plas ma is often n ormal but may 
be considerably increases Sodium reten- 
tion IS closely related to the formation of 
edema in this condition, and salt restric- 
tion IS a fundamental part of the thera 
peutic regimen 

Kulney function tests Renal insuffi- 
ciency does not occur in the c>’pu^al ne- 
phrotic syndrome The kidneys retain their 
normal capacity to concentrate and dilute 
the unne The function tests particularly 
the PSP excreuon test, may show slight, 
transient impairment, but normal results 
are the rule 

Basal metabolic rate The metabohc 
rate is often lower than normal The mean- 
ing of this finding is not clear Recent 
studies indicate that thyroid function is 
normal, but sigmficant quantities of the 
protein bound hormone may be lost in the 
unne Treatment with thyroid hormone 
usually does not improve the patient nor 
does It alter the metabolic rate appreciably 

Blood counts Total white cell and 
differenual counts are usually within nor- 
mal limits There may be a shght anemia, 
which becomes more severe with the onset 
of renal failure 

Arteriolar Neplirosclerovis Hypertensive 
vascular disease results in renal failure m 
approximately 10 per cent of cases Renal 
damage and insufficiency of less than 
lethal grade are much more common oc- 
currences than this figure would suggest 


The two general forms of this disease are 
differentiated by the rate of propess Wien 
the propession is slow and the patient dies 
after many years, the term “benign hyper 
tension” is used When the disease pro- 
gresses rapidly and the patient dies within 
a few months after the onset, it is described 
as “malignant ” Benign and malignant by 
pertension are by no means clearly distinct, 
and their antemortem manifestations over- 
lap widely 

There are no laboratory findmgs stnctlv 
charactenstic of this disease The chief 
value of laboratory methods in the study 
of hypertensive disease is in the determina- 
tion of prognosis as mdicated by the depee 
of ren^ excretory failure Unfortunately 
these findmgs occur late In the course of 
the disease when they are of less practical 
use 

l/n'imlysts During the early phases of 
hyTcrtensive disease the unne remains en- 
urely normal A small amount of protein 
and a few hyaime casts are often among 
the first urinary findings These may be 
present for years before other signs of 
renal damage appear A padually inczeas 
mg unne volume, a reversal of the day- 
night ratio and a durunishmg capaaty to 
concentrate the unne occur before the 
onset of renal decompensation "nus course 
of events is quite like that associated with 
chrome glomerulonephntis These two con- 
ditions are always dilfficult, and sometimes 
impossible, to differentiate Red cells and 
other formed elements occur in the unne 
vith very similar frequency m both dis 
eases Gross or microscopic hematuria is 
always a pave sign during the course 
of hypertensive disease and is particularly 
charactenstic of the malignant form The 
terminal unnary findmgs are those of renal 
failure and uremia 

Kidney function tests. As has already 
been mdicated. the onset of renal failure 
occurs late in the course of hypertensive 
vascular disease The pracucal value of 
the kidney function tests is, therefore, dis- 
tinctly limted Their prognostic value is 
often sufficient to justify their use Selec- 
tion of the procedures and interpretation of 
results are the same as that desenbed in 
connection with chronic glomerulonephritis 

Blood counts. Anemia associated wnth 
advanced nephrosclerosis may be of the 
same seventy and type as that associated 
with chronic glomerulonephntis During 
the earlier course of the disease anemia 
is not charactenstic of hypertensive vas- 
cular disease of the pnmary type Anemia 



The Urine 


IS more hl^ely to indicate the presence 
of chronic glomenilonephntis Leukocyte 
counts are not altered 

ntood chemtstry The blood chemical 
changes in adtanced nephrosclerosis are 
those characteristic of renal failure and 
uremia 

Pjclonephritis This disease is character 
ized by inflammatory nscular and cica 
tricial changes owing to the multiphcalion 
of pathogenic bacteria in the ren^ paren 
chyma and the pehocalyceal system Clin 
ici mterest in pyelonephritis has greatly 
increased since the recent Introduction of 
quantitative studies of normal and patho- 
gemc bacteria of the genitourinary tract 
(Kleeman et al 1960) These studies ha\e 
mdicated the prevalence and insidious char 
acter of significant infection of the onnary 
tract A number of predisposmg factors 
figure in the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis 
Some of the more important of these are 
obstructive lesions located anywhere from 
the nephron to the external meatus preg 
nancy in which asymptomatic bactenoria is 
especially frequent diabetes mcUitus ureth 
ral instrumentation and disturbances of 
bladder innervation 

The majority of instances of pyeloneph 
ntis are caused by coliform bacteria Less 
commonly infection is caused by Proteus 
rmlgans Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
various species of staphylococcus and en 
terococcus 

Unrwhsts The unnary sediment in 
acute pyelonephritis is characterized by 
pus leukocyte casts and varying degrees 
of hematuria without red cell or hemoglobin 
casts Quantitative proteinuria rarely ex 
ceeds 1 to 2 gm per day In chronic pye 
lonephntis the unnary findings vary widely 
depending on the degree of active inflamma 
tion the associated pathologic changes and 
the presence of congestive heart failure 

The so called ghlter cell ” although not 
pathognomonic of pyelonephntis is rarely 
seen in large numbers in other forms of 
renal disease This is a large swollen cell 
with cytoplasmic granules showing Brown 
lan movement The exact ongm and 
identity of this cell are in some doubt 

When quantitative urine cultures show 
100 000 bacteria or more per ml of urine 
they furnish important diagnostic informa 
tion and a valuable guide to therapy Smee 
bacteriuna of this magnitude can exist in 
the absence of demonstrable infection of 
renal tissue the correlation of bactenologic 
findings with the diagnosis of pyeloneph 
ritis is not a precise one 


57 

Acute Renal Failure A large number of 
conditions charactenzed by sudden impair 
ment or cessation of renal function with 
anuria or obguna are included under the 
term acute renal failure Among the di 
verse causes are surgical shock traumauc 
injunes massive hemorrhage severe vomit 
mg or diarrhea transfusion reactions and 
certain nephrotoxic agents Pathologists 
have described the lesion as lower nephron 
nephrosis and more recently as acute tu 
bular necrosis It may occur m the pres 
ence or absence of intrinsic renal disease 

The importance of acute renal failure 
as a diagnostic category is deriv ed from the 
fact that the disorder can in many cases 
be fully reversed by proper treatment It is 
therefore extremely important that the situ 
atjon be recognized in its earliest phases 
Without doubt the most important factors 
contnbutmg to the proper diagnosis of 
acute renal failure are a thorough under 
standing of its pathogenesis and a keen 
awareness of the clinical setting in which 
it is likely to occur A full presentation of 
these matters is beyond the scope of this 
discussion (see Franklm and Memll 
I960) 

Unvalysts The volume of unne is 
small usuaUy less than 200 ml per 24 
hours but actual anuna is uncommon The 
occurrence of anuna should lead one to 
suspect obstruction of the unnary tract or 
acute renal failure supenmposed on pre- 
existing intrinsic disease of the kidney The 
specific gravity of the unne is relatively 
Wgh 1 018 or more and the reaction is 
usually strongly acid After the first two 
or three days the urme specific gravity may 
drop to 1 010 or below Proteinuna is often 
marked in the beginning but tends to clear 
with persistence of oliguria Small to mod 
erate numbers of granular casts or blood 
pigment casts are commonly found 

When acute renal failure is reversed or 
the disease enters the diuretic phase the 
unne volume increases rapidly by 50 or 
100 per cent a day A generalized desenp- 
tion of urmary findings cannot be given for 
this disease category since the wide vana 
tions that occur depend upon the etiologic 
factors involved and the diverse courses 
that the condition can take 

Blood chemistry Blood urea nitrogen 
nonprotein nitrogen creatinine and unc 
acid nse gradually or precipitately depend 
ing on the rate of protein ntaboUsm and 
the nature of the underlying cause of renal 
failure Serum sodium chlonde and caJ 
cium concentration tend to decrease

METHODS USED IN THE STVDY OE BLOOD 


PRELIiMlNARI CONSIDERATtO.NS SIETHODS OF OBTAIMNG BLOOD 


Studies of the blood and blood forming tis 
sues are used in practically e%ery phase of 
medical practice Certain observations of 
peripheral blood are unuersally regarded 
as indispensable to the examination of all 
patients These procedures and their inter* 
pretations are so numerous and important 
that they form a separate branch of med 
ical science called clinical hematology, 
which contains a great deal of information 
concerning the anatomv and physiology of 
the blood and the laboratory methods by 
which this information is commonly ob- 
tained Examinations of the blood derive 
their practical meaning in rehiion to the 
care of patients only as they are correlated 
with the entire cbmcal condition 

The blood consists of a fluid of compb 
cated and variable composition, the plasma, 
m which are suspended erythrocytes. leu 
kocytes, and platelets If coagulauon is pre- 
vented the formed elements can be sepa 
rated from the pale straw-colored plasma 
When blood coagulates, the fluid that rei 
mains after separation of the clot is called 
serum Serum differs from plasma onlv by 
/los^f the protein fibrinogen the latter be 
'^mg removed as insoluble fibnn threads in 
the process of coagulation Serum and 
plasma are used for many important studies 
in clinical chemistry and immunology The 
techniques of hematology are concerned 
chiefly with the cellular constituents of the 
Wood, the 2 T number or concentration the 
relative distribution of various types of 
cells, the presence of abnormal cells and 
many qualitative features 


Tliere are two sources of blood for lab 
oratory tests capillary or peripheral blood 
and venous Wood Both have their advo- 
cates, advantages, and disadvantages 

Cafnllnry or Pertpheral Blood 

It IS claimed that what we call peripheral 
blood is more likely arteriolar than capillary 
For most cbmcal examinations, includ 
mg cell counts and determination of the 
concentration of hemoglobin blood is best 
^/obtain ed from a vein However, for making 
differentiaTblood counts and also for the 
enumeration of cellular elements blood 
may be obtained from the lobe of an car, 

^ the palmar surfaces of the tip of the finger, 
tor, in the case of mfants, the plantar sur- 
faces of the great toe or the heel In the 
case of the ear, the free margin of the lobe, 
not the side, should be punctured Puncture 
can be made dehberately and slowly be- 
cause there is almost no pain connected 
with U The puncture should be about 
3 mm deep It is possible to make JOO 
blood smears or to collect several miUiliters 
of blood from a well made puncture If the 
patient is bedridden the finger will be 
found more convenient because the ap- 
proach is easier, otherwise the ear is pref 
erable because it is less sensiuve An edeiTi;:^' 
atous or congested part should not be 
used Tree flovv of blo^ is essential to ob 
tain reproducible results comparable to 
those of venous blood C old and cyano tic>-

for false high figures for red cel! and white

cell counts It can be obsiated by massage 
before the puncture unul the skm is pink 
and warm Vigorous squeezing after the 
puncture is another source of errors 

The site is first rubbed well with a gauze 
pad moistened with 70 per cent alcohol or 
another antiseptic to remo%e dirt and epi 
thebal debris and to increase the amount 
of blood m the part After allowing suffi 
cient time for drying and for the circulation 
to equalize the skin is punctured mih a 
blood lancet (of which there are several 
patterns) or preferably waih a short stout 
sharp three cornered needle which is 
known as a glovers needle The Bard 
Parker No 11 scalpel blade has been recom 
mended as a good instrument for obtaining 
blood from a skin puncture Still better is 
a similar blade made of stainless steel 
which can be mounted in a stopper and 
kept immersed in alcohol The so-called 
JIagedom l>pe and other similar needles 
are widely used Glass capdlary pnckers 
have been recommended for earlobe punc 
tures That serum hepauus can be trans 
muted by incompletely sterUized needles 
must be recognized The etiologic agent is 
resistant to oi^mary simple forms of stcnli 
zation Many laborator> workers now insist 
upon individual needles or lancets for each 
pauent and sterilize them by autoclaving 
after each use Still better are disposable 
needles which are likely to replace the 
older t>pcs 

Tccimique of Puncture Whichever site 
15 chosen cleansing with a suitable disin 
fectint and dr>ing is followed by a 2 to 
3 mm deep pnek preferably with a dis 
posable needle The puncture is practically 
painless if properly made with a sharp 
needle It should be made with a firm quick 
slab which however must not be so quick 
or made from so great a distance that its 
site and depth are uncertain A deep punc 
ture is not more painful than a superficial 
and makes it unnecessary to repeat the 
procedure 

The first drop of blood that appears is 
^/iped away because it contains tissue 
juices and the second is used for examina 
lion If the skin at the site of the puncture 
is not^dry ilTe blood will not form a rounded 
drop as it exudes The blood must not be 
pressed out since this dilutes it with fluid 
from the tissues but moderate pressure 
some distance above the puncture fs allow 
able After the needed blood has been ob- 
tained a pad of gauze or cottno soaked in 
an antiseptic is applied to the puncture and 


the patient instructed to apply slight pres 
sure until bleeding has ceased When the 
heel IS used it must be made warm prob- 
ably done most easily by immersion in 
^hot water or by use of a hot water com 
press Otherwise values sigmficinily higher 
than m v enous blood may be obtained 
especially in the newborn On the first day 
of life average differences as high as 2 gm 
of hemoglobin per 100 ml may be present 
^j^he values for hematocrit red cells hemo- 
globin platelets and osmotic fragility arc 
lower in peripheral blood than m venous 
The leukocyte count is about the same cx 
cepf Hben the skm is cold in which case 
the count may be higher 


Venotu Blood 

Veins have become important in the 
modem practice of medicine in two ways 
^ a source of blood for the many and con 
stantly rising number of blood tests and 
an avenue for introduction of various 
therapeutic agents including blood itself 
This ever increasing need for veins as 
portals of entry and of exit makes it para 
mount to do everything m our power to 
preserve their patency as the condition for 
their usefulness especially since the num 
ber of easily accessible good veins Is lim 
ited by anatomy and since their structure Is 
debcate and vulnerable The chief responsi 
bility for preservation of veins rests on med 
ical technologists interns and residents 
because they are the mam users of veins 
Three factors are involved in a good 
venipuncture the venipunctunst the pa 
tient and his vems and the equipment 
Tlic kcnipuncturc The venipuncture is 
in most instances a relatively simple pro 
cedurc but only if the obtaining of the 
blood specimen or the introduction of the 
therapeutic agent is considered the sole 
purpose of the operation The operator must 
be aware of the old phrase in ancient medi 
cine that the doctors main motto should be 
“pnmum non nocerc’* — “the first thing is 
not to inflict damage" The vein that one 
tries to enter should be preserved for in 
numerable future uses Actually the hfe of 
the paUent may sometimes depend on vein 
patency 

The hematomas displaying all the colors 
of the rainbow in anticubital fossas around 
wrists and other sundry places testify clo- 
qucniJy to the operatoTs lick of sDIJ or 
lack of judgment As i rule the damage

IS only temporary but it may be long last 
mg or e%en permanent The situation is 
even worse when the \ems bj nature are 
diHicult to find or when there has been 
much past use and some abuse Enough has 
been said to make the point that a venipunc 
ture IS an operation that is by no means 
tnfiing and must be learned at the begm 
mng and approached with due care and 
deliberation 

The Patient and His Veins The patient 
should be reassured with a few words well 
chosen to fit the particular situation Self 
assurance and poise tvdl do much to estab 
hsh the proper rapport The patient should 
be made comfortable and the approach to 
his arm should be convenient for the oper 
itor There is no need to add to the difficul 
ties by trying to do the puncture in an 
incont enient position Ambulatory patients 
should be seated comfortably preferably In 
1 chair provided with an armrest or at a 
table on which the arm can be placed com 
fortably The operator sits at the opposite 
side of the table (Fig 4—1) 

Tlie veins should ^ inspected and evalu 
ated If the patients condition is such that 
he may have to receive repeated trans 
fusions his elbow veins should be kept in 
tact because they are more suitable for that 
purpose Veins at other sites for cvample 
on the dorsal surface of the liand tliougb 
delicate and less fixed are good enough to 
be used for drawing of blood ^Vhen Ccins 
are deep and not felt distinctly an attempt 
to enter them is bad practice because it 


amounts to blind probing One can get 
around this difTiculty by using a toumiqvct 
which makes the veins more prominent and 
palpable for orientation Such trial com 
prcssion should be released and repeated 
again when one is ready for the actual 
puncture 

In patients with many punctures In the 
past and sequelae thereof such a prcllmi 
nary study of the veins is parucubrly im 
portant and may reveal more available veins 
Uian would seem apparent at first glance 
Tin. Eijinpmcnt The syringe should be 
of the proper size for the amount of blood 
to be drawn The fit of the plunger and 
birrel which Is borne out by the identical 
number of both and the inicgrit} of ihe 
synnge up are things to be checked The 

t and usefulness of the syringe can bo 
longed if the operator rinses the syringe 
h cold tap water immediately after use 
get nd of the blood Disposable syringes 
claimed to be gaimng in popularity 
The needle also has to be chosen as to 
gauge and length for the job alieacl The 
gauge number expresses the thlckmcss of 
the needle The smaller Uie number iht 
thicker the needle The length of the nccillc 
used depends upon the depth of the vein 
The tip should be inspected most carefully 
A blunt or bent Up will defeat the purpo<c 
of the puncture and will also damage the 
patients vein The needle should be tested 
for patency Again disposable needles stem 
to be the answer to liie problem of sharp 
needles However some institutions may

IS usually the result of blood clotung

ing has been recommended to loosen the 
“frozen” syringe It is first filled with water

serted through the tip Then two needles of 
diiTerent but sufficiently close gauges are 
fitted together so that one is inserted Into 
tlic lumen of the other One end of this 
assembly is attached to the “frozen” syringe 
and the other to the end of a small svringe 
filled with water Gentle pressure on the 
smaller of the two sjringes may loosen the 


“frozen” syringe Other recommended pro- 
cedures gently heaung the barrel under 
running hot water and quickly withdraw 
ing the plunger before it also expands or 
(soaking in a mixture of equal parts alcohol 
^and gl)cenn To prevent such compHca 
tions experienced technologists rmse the 
synnge and needle with cold water immedi 
ately after use 

■^METnoD OF Obtaining Blood from a Vein 
It is best to have the patient Ijing down 
If he is sitting his arm should be firml) 
supported Never have the patient standing 
or seated on a high stool Although very 
few patients faint as a result of vempunc 
ture this danger must alwajs be kept in 
mind The'skin is cleansed at the bend or 
at an) other site of the elbow by rubbing 
well with 70 per cent alcohol or anothej 
suitable dismfectant It is then wiped dry 
with sterile absorbent cotton 

A'^nibber tourniquet is used to increase 
venous pressure and to make the veins 
more prominent and easier to enter but to 
prevent hemoconccntration the pressure 
should not be maintained longer than 
necessary 


The 

A rubber bandage bound firmly around 
the upper part of the arm is a very suitable 
form of tourniquet The outer end ^ould 
be tucked under the last round in such a 
manner that a slight pull will release the 
bandage (Fig 4—1) The cuff of a blood 
pressure apparatus answers admirably or a 
soft rubber tube may be used A blood 
pressure cuff has the advantage that it pet 
mits adjustment of the compression to a 
level sufficient to reduce the flow of venous 
blood without stopping arterial circulation 
This is usually at approximately the middle 
between the systolic and diastohc pressures' 
Also reduction or release of pressure after 
the needle has entered the vem Is facili 
tated Occasionally it will be sufficient for 
an assistant or even the patient to grasp 
the upper arm firmly If one uses a rubber 
tubing as tourniquet one can apply the 
proper pressure by first compressing the 
arm so as to suppress the radial pulse and 
then releasing the pressure just enough to 
feel the radial pulse feebly The patient js 
asked to open and close fus fist several 
tunes This causes the veuis to become dis 
tended Giving the patient an active role in 
the procedure helps to take his mind off the 
puncture Even if not seen veins can usu 
ally be felt beneath the skm In fat persons 
veins that shtnv as blue streaks are usually 
too superficial and too small 

After all prelimmary steps have been 
taken the skin is cleansed with a suitable 
disinfectant The next step is to fix the vein 
in position This is done by supporting the 
patients forearm with the operators hand 
and compressing and puUing the soft tissues 
just below the intended puncture site wth 
the operators thumb The syringe is held 
between the thumb and the last three 
fingers of the other hand The back of these 
fingers are rested on the patient s arm The 
free index finger rests against the hub of 
the needle and serves as a guide A promi 
nent vein may be entered with a single 
direct puncture of skin and vein This one 
step procedure is less painful 

\Vhen veins are difficult to find as in 
adults and in children a two-step pro 
cedure is used First the skin is punctured 
m the vicinity of the vein and then the vem 
Itself is punctured Successful entrance into 
the vein is followed immediate!) by appear 
ance of blood in the syringe If that does 
not take place the plunger is withdrawn 
slightly and in most instances blood ^p 
pears Next the tourniquet may be loosened 
shghtly if blood flows freely otherwise it 


Blood C5 

may be left as put on originally until the 
desired amount of blood is obtained At this 
point the patient is asked to open his fist 
the tourniquet is released a small addi 
tional amount of blood is permitted to enter 
the syringe the needle is withdrawn gentle 
pressure is applied to the site of the punc 
tore with a pad of dry gauze or cotton and 
the patient is Instructed to take over press 
mg the pad and to raise the outstretched 
arm for a few minutes This usuall) stops 
the bleeding and prevents formation of 
hematoma Occasionally a small dressing 
(Band Aid) may be applied maml> to pre 
vent a stain on the rolled down sleeve The 
operator must see that the patients condi 
tion IS satiSfactorj before he is dismissed 
If there is any sign of continued discom 
Fort anxiety bleeding or shock the patient

It JS usually easy to secure 5 to 15 ml of 
blood or even more if required If the 
needle is sharp and smooth the procedure 
causes the patient surprisingly little mcon 
vexuence seldom more than docs an oidi 
nary hypodermic injection Dull needles 
may be sharpened by rubbing the bevel 
pomt forward on a hard fine oilstone 
There is rarely any difficulty m Inserting a 
needle into a vein except in children and 
m patients in whom the arm is fat and the 
veins are small If desired one of the veins 
about the ankle can be used In infintsV 
blood may be secured from the femoral or 
the external jugular vein and rarely and 
only with approval of the attending physi 
cian from the superior longitudinal sinus 
by puncturing through the posterior angle 
of the anterior fontanel _A short needle 
(about Is inch) of rather large caliber is 
used for this latter procedure 

\Vhen the blood has been expelled the 
plunger should be separated from the bar 
rel Otherwise the sjringe may become 
frozen when the blood clots or dries If 
that happens the plunger may be loosened 
by one of many recommended procedures 

Instead of a synnge many other devices 
for securing blood from a vein may be cm 
ployed Two of these arc shown in rigurc

their construction in sufficient detail Tlicy

Complications of Venipunctures and 
Suggestions for Their Prevention 
Immediate Local Complicaiions Hemo- 
jconcentration is the result of prolonged ap 
phcation of the tourniquet 

Failure of blood to enter the syringe is 
the result of several factors Excessive pull 
on plunger may collapse a small vein 
Remedy using a slight back and forth 
movement and reducing the force of aspira 
tion Piercing the outer coat of the vein 
without entering the lumen may also ac 
count for the failure of blood to enter the 
syringe Remedy withdrawing slightly and 
reentenng the vein This comphcation ina> 
occasionally be followed b> hematoma for 
mation As soon as signs of beginmng 
hematoma are nouced the needle should 
be withdrawn local pressure apphed and 
venipuncture attempted on the other arm 
Transfixation of the vem also accounts for 
failure to obtain blood Remedy slight 
withdrawal followed b> gentle aspiration to 
see whether blood appears If this fads the 
puncture may have to be repeated This 
comphcation is frequently followed by for 
mation of a hematoma The same pro 
cedure is followed as outhned in the pre- 
ceding paragraph JCirculaioiy failure is 
another cause and the situation I’s enarefy 
be>ond the control of the operator 
/ In the case of these or of any other com 
■'pheations failure to draw blood after 
two attempts should be an indication not 
to make further attempts but to request 
another operator to try 

Another not infrequent Immediate com 
j^llcation is syncope This is best treated b> 
having the patient he down if he is not 
already in this position This is to be fol 
lowed immediately bj calling a physician 
unless the operator is one 
/Continued bleeding may occur in patients 
with a bleeding tendency whatever the 
source Local pressure as a rule solves the 
problem 

Late Local Complication Thrombosis of 
-/the vein is sometimes due to trauma but 
occasionally to infection and resulting 


Laboratorv Methods 

thrombophlebitis These complications arc 
extremely rare if the precautions and recom 
mendations discussed in this chapter are 
observed 

Late General Complication Homologous 
jserum jaundice is caused by transmission 
of the virus bj improper handling and by 
contamination of the needle or the s}Tinge 
Aseptic technique and use of adequately 
sterilized needles and syringes and -pref 
erably disposable needles may be expected 
to eliminate this source of transmitted 
disease 

Venipuncture in Infants 

In infants and children venipuncture 
presents special problems because of the 
small size of the veins and the difficulty of 
control However even here much can be 
achieved by the same approach that was 
outhned for procedures in adults 

Restraining the infant to reduce mobility 
iise of sharp needles of appropriate size 
careful inspection of the veins making cer 
am that the pressure applied with the 
oumiquct is not excessive (best achieved 
by feeling pulsation of the radial artery) 
will contribute to a successful veiupunc 
ture when others may have failed or given 
up trying External jugular puncture may 
be tried in difficult cases and is frequently 
successful Occasionally the internal jugu 
lar vem may have to be used Puncture of 
the superior sagittal smus is mentioned 
here only to discourage ns use Any comph 
cation that would be harmless fn another 
area for example a hematoma may have 
serious consequences 

For hematologic examination blood ob- 
tained by vempuncture is delivered to 6ot 
ties or tubes contaimng a suitable antico- 
agulant Tlus transfer must be made with 
out delay Mixing with the anticoagulant 
IS accomplished by thorough but gentle ro- 
talioD of the container 

If no anticoagulant is used blood smears 
should be prepared immediately before clot 
ling occurs Placing a small Tmount of 
blood on a siliconized watchglass will pre 
vent coagulation and make the blood usable 
for preparation of smears and for quanti 
talive and morphologic studies Mixing the 
jblood with heparin serves the same pur 
jpose but smears of heparinized blood 
jstained with Wrights slam have a blue 
/background 

To obtain serum blood is kept at room 
temperature or In a 37° C incubator until 
a clot has formed and begins lo retract and 



The Ulood 


then placed in the refrigerator overnight 
at 4 to 8° C To accelerate retraction the 
clot may be separated from the wall of the 
container with a platinum needle a thin 
glass rod or a wooden applicator before it 
IS placed in the icebox To obtain serum 
more rapidly the blood may be defibnnated 
with glass beads or a glass rod 

Anticoagulants 

The four most popular are a mixture of 
Ammonium and potassium oxalate triso- 
dium citrate Sequcstrene (EDTA) and 
jhepann The first three prevent coagula 
lion by removing calcium from the blood 
plasma by precipitation or bmdmg in un 
^i^zed form Hepann neutralizes thrombm 
^Trisodlum citrate is used to prevent co 
agulation of blood for transfusions Seques 
Irene and hepann may be used for the 
same purpose but not the toxic oxalate 
mixture 

v^he mixture of ammonium (six parts) 
and potassium oxalate (four pans) 2 mg 
per I ml of blood is probably the most 
widely used anticoagulant Oxalated blood 
tioes not affect the mean corpuscular vol 
'iime and may be used for hemoglobin 
hematoent and cell counts Its usefulness 
for blood films is limited to the first few 
minutes The reason Crenatlon of red cells 
vacuolation in the cytoplasm of granulo* 
i cytes phagocytosis of oxalate crystals arte 
fact formation in the nuclei of lymphoc)tcs 
and monocytes and other malformations 
develop rapidly 

Trisodium citrate is used in a mixture 
of one part of a ^ 8 per cent aqueous solu 
non and nine parts of blood in blood coagu 
lation studies and in the erjthrocyfc sedl 
mentation test 

Sequestrene (EDTA) is used in a concen 
tratjon of 1 0 to 2 0 mg per 1 ml of blood 
The dipotassium or disodium salt of ethy 
lenediamine tetn acetic acid is becoming 
increasingly popular It must be mixed 
-fhoroughI> with the blood It equals oxalate 
for hematocrit studies and is superior be 
cause It preients formation of artefacts 
even on prolonged standing Acceptable 
blood smears can be prepared after 2 to 
3 hours and cell counts even after 12 hours 
J Also platelet countmg is still possible after 
' a few Iiours 

Hepann 0 1 to 0 2 mg per 1 ml of 
blood does not affect the corpuscular size 
and hematocrit It is the best anticoagulant 
for prevention of hemolysis and for osmotic 
fragility tests It is not satisfactory when 


67 

blood smears are to be prepared because 
it produces a blue background in Wright s 
stamed slides 

Sources of Error from the Use of Anti 
coagulints Even with the use of the best 
anticoagulant changes take place that may 
^ead to errors unless suitable precautions 
ate taken Swelling of erythrocytes raises 
|the mean corpuscular volume (M C V ) and 
[Osmotic fragility and lowers the sedimen 
itation rate Leukocytes autolyze and pro 
jthrombin time increa ses Hemoglobin is 
aff^ted least Blood smears should be pre 
pared immediately Quantitative studies 
such as cell counts and estimation of the 
fecdimentation rate of erythrocytes (ESR) 
jshould be completed within six hours It is 
important to mix the blood thoroughly im 
mediately after it is obtained a nd before 
it Is examined if stored This is best done 
by rotation for not Jess than two minutes 
During the interval the blood should be 
kept in the refrigerator at 4 to 8° C Freez 
mg makes the blood useless 

of Anticoagulant Tubes or 
liottles The most suitable container for col 
lection is one of somewhat more than 5 ml 
capacity with a mouth wide to permit the 
entry of counting pipets The stopper must 
be clean and fit well so that there will be 
no leaking of blood even when the bottle 
is inverted 

The anticoagulant solution is prepared as 
follows 

1 2 gm 
0 6 gm 

Distilled water 100 0 ml 

If this solution IS to be kept in stock add 
1 ml of 40 per cent formalin as a pre 
servative 

^Transfer 0 5 ml of this solution to each 
bottle or tube and allow it to dry at room 
temperature or on a bacteriologic incubator 
Do not dry in an oven or autoclave since 
labove 80° C oxalate is converted to car 
Ibonate which has no anticoagulant proper 
ties Warning Blood collected in tlus anti 
coagulant mixture cannot be used for chem 

{ leal determinations of nitrogen or potas

MACROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 

Important information may be obtained 
from the appearance of the blood Inspcc 
tion of a centrifuged blood specimen with 
the naked eye may furnish valuable infer 
maiion The inspection should include the 
relame heights of the red cell, buffy coat, 
and plasma columns 

Estimation of the Sedimentation Rate 
After the blood is transferred from the 
synnge into the hematocrit tube a few 
r^nutes will of necessity elapse until cen 
trifugation is started Inspection of the 
hemalocnt tube at the end of 5 to 10 min 
utes may reieal excessue sedimentation of 
I the red cells It^lO per cent or more of the 
total blood column is cleared of red cells, 
the conclusion is justified that the sedimen 
tation rate is increased If this is the case 
an accurate determination of the sedimen 
tation rate is indicated 

In order to take advantage of this rough 
estimation of the sedimentation rate, the 
tube must be held as vertical as possible 
and the time of sedimentation must be 
noted 

The most frequent causes of an accel 
erated sedimentation rate detected m this 
\crude way are s.^Me anemia rouleau x_due-. 
to elevated serum” globulin or auToagglu 
tinins 

The lIuH) Coat Normally a thin layer at 
the line of separation between the red cell 
column and plasma seen best in the centri 
fuged specimen the bufly coat may begin 
to form in a relatively short time especially 
in leukemia with high cell counts 
■* The Plasma Green color is a sign of ex 
cessive bilirubin The pink or reddish hue 
f the transparent plasma suggests hemo- 
lobinemla It should be kept in mind that 
poor technique in collcctmg the blood spcci 
men is the most frequent cause of hemol 
ysis Cloudy plasma points to leukemia If 
■the specimens were not obtained within an 
hour or two after a fat rich meal cloudy 
plasma may point to nephrosis or certain 
abnormal hyperglobulincmias especially 
cryoglobulinemia 

THE EiaTHROC^TES 
Hemoglobin 

Hemoglobin the main component of the 


LABOKAfOKi .Mmions 

red blood cell, serves as the vehicle for the 
transportation of oxygen and of COj When 
full) saturated, each gram of hemoglobin 
holds approximately 1 34 ml of oxygen 
The red cell mass of tFc adult being about 
2000 ml contains approximately GOO gm 
of hemoglobin, capable of carrying 800 ml 
of oxygen 

Hemoglobin is a conjugated protein, 
which consists of a basic protein, the glo- 
bin and ferrohemc (ferroprotoporphyrm), 
which serves as the prosthetic (active) 
group Hemoglobin (reduced hemoglobin or 
Hb) consists of one molecule of globin and 
four molecules of hemin (each containing 
one molecule of iron in the ferrous state) 
Reduced hemoglobin (Hb) is part of the 
"active*’ hemoglobin and can combine re 
versibly with oxygen and carbon monoxide 
When Hb is oxygenated, it becomes oxy* 
hemoglobin (HbOj), which consists of one 
molecule of globin and four molecules of 
hemin (each with one molecule of iron In 
the ferrous slate) and is combined with 
oxygen Its mom function Is the transport 
of oxygen from places of high oxygen 
pressure (lungs) to places of low oxygen 
pressure (ussucs) This is possible since 
hemoglobin (Hb) forms with oxygen a dls 
sociable hemoglobm-oxygen complex, oxy 
hemoglobin (HbO-), which releases oxygen 
rcaddy at a low o'xygcn pressure The Iron 
m the molecule remains in the fetrous or 
reduced form 

Hb+0^ HbO» 

At an oxygen tension of 100 mm (pul 
monary alveoli) approximately 95 to 96 
per cent of the hemoglobin is converted to 
oxyhemoglobin Another function of the 
hemoglobin is the transport of CO^ from the 
tissues to the lung If the ferrous iron in 
the molecule is oxidized to the feme iron, 
as in methemoglobin, the molecule Joses 
its capacity to combine with Oj and COj 

Hemoglobinometry is one of the most fre 
quent tests in clinical laboratories At the 
same time and for good rtasons it has been 
until recently one of the most inaccurate 
tests Unavallablbty of stable standards, the 
practical need for a simple and rapid pro 
o^ure for a commonly and frequently used 
test on one hand and the inherent inac 
curacy of most shortcut methods on the 
other, and the well known defectiveness of 
the human eye in matching colors are only 
a few of the reasons that have made this 
one of the least reliable tests in clinical 
pathology, at least until relatively recently 



The 

To all these problems one needs to add 
all kinds of variations in what is called 
normal hemoglobin Those associated with 
sex and age have been studied most thor 
oughly Hemoglobin levels at \anous ages 
are shown in Figure 4-3 

Anemia is one of the most common dis 
eases frequently it is a comphcation of 
other diseases Fortumtely it is a condition 
readily amenable to successful therapy if 
recognized and appropriately classified as 
iviU be seen later The clinical diagnosis of 
anemia is difficult It is based on the esti 
mation of the color of the skin and of visi 
ble mucous membranes both not too re 
hable mdicators To make matters even 
more comphcated anemia is frequently 
masked by other mamfestations of many 
diseases To a limited extent similar con 
siderations apply to conditions with ab 
normally high hemoglobin For all these 
reasons the correct estimation of hemo 
globin is important and is one of the rou 
tine tests done on practicall} every patient 
Detemiining the Concentration of Hemo 
lobin Quantitative estimation of hemoglo- 
in IS less tedious and if reasonably ac 
curate usually is more helpful than an 
erythrocyte count offers the simplest 
means of detecting the existence and de 
gtee of anemta and of judging the effect of 
treatment of anemic condition?) Pallor ob

There are many methods for determming 
the concentration of hemoglobin 

The custom of recotdmg hemoglobin m 
tenns of percentage of an indefinite normal 
IS grossl> inaccurate and leads to much con 
fusion It could be compared to an attempt 
to set up a normal for weather and to ex 
press temperature m percentages of the 
arbitrar) normal disregarding geographic 
seisonal daily and many other forms oi 
vanauons in weather No single normal 
standard can be applied to all ages and to 
both sexes The situation is further comph 
cated by the fact that manufacturers of 
different hemoglobmometers have atbiirar 
ily selected values ranging from 13 8 to 
17 2 gm per 100 ml of blood as the equiva 
lent of 100 per cent A record therefore 
means little unless one knows what ijisiru 
ment was used and the age and sex of the 
patient Confusion Is best avoided if records 
are made in terms of the actual amount of 
hemoglobin that is m grams per 100 ml 
of blood The reading on any type of instru 
lucnt can be readily converted into the ac 
tual content of hemoglobin expressed as 
grams per 100 mi of Wood if one knows 
whit amount of hemoglobin was adopted 
by the makers as 100 per cent piovidcd 
of course that the particular instrument is

accurately standardized This calculation 
\vill be gi\en wth the description of the 
\anous instruments 

When one evaluates the relative merits 
of clinical laboratory tests at least four 
desiderata are considered the accuracy of 
a single determination as compared with 
a known standard the reproducibihty of a 
senes of determinations when done by the 
same technician by a group of techmaans 
in the same laboratory and by different 
laboratories the speed from the point of 
view of availabihty in case of emergency 
and the simphcity of the procedure from 
the point of view of economy 

It has been stated that there is probably 
no procedure more commonly used m elm 
ical laboratones than hemoglobmometry 
and there are few that are less satisfactory 
in then results (Cannon 1955) The de 
ficiencies may reside in part in inadequa 
cies of the chosen method In larger part 
hoivever they result from manipulative 
errors in the measurement and processing 
of the samples of blood The latter mvoUes 
questions of technical proficiency that arc 
entirely within the control of the analyst 
himself When however he converts his 
observations such as gasometnc or pho* 
tometric readings or measurements of spe 
cific gravity to grams of hemoglobm in 
100 ml of blood he must depend upon his 
own calibration or a calibration supplied 
by an instrument maker If a umform 
hemoglobin standard were available na 
uonally and a single method of analysis 
widely practiced the individual laboratory 
would then have assurance not only that its 
results would be comparable from month 
to month but that they would also be com 
parable with those from other laboratories 
employing the same standard Inconsisten 
cies in results that persisted under these 
conditions could then be clearly attributed 
to technical and manipulative errors 

There are at least three reasons why de 
fining the limits of accuracy for hemoglobin 
determinations would be desirable First 
the prevalent opinion in circles of expen 
enced hematologists is that there must be 
difference in value of at least 1 gm of 
hemoglobin to be significant On the other 
hand many clinicians are disturbed when 
told that a change in hemoglobin of 0 2 gm 
IS not significant It would be desirable to 
reconcile these differences so that chmeians 
may know when a true change in hemoglo 
bin concentrauon has actually occurred as 
opposed to a change due to expected \ana 
tion of the method 


L VDORATORV M FTl lODS 

Second clinical pathologists need not ex 
pect from their technicians a degree of ac 
curacy that is beyond the limits of inhereni 
accuracy of the instruments or methods 
employed in their laboratories 

Finally the standard of reproducibility 
will be different for one technician and for 
a group of technicians in a single labora 
tory It will have to be different again when 
the results of two different laboratories are 
compared The physician must recognize 
these facts for otherwise he may expect 
from the laboratory a degree of accuracy 
and reproducibihty of hemoglobin determi 
nation that is greater than is possible and 
jusufiable This is further complicated by 
the fact that as a rule the physician at 
the bedside is using a value obtained from 
the examination of a single sample and not 
multiple ones Therefore the physician 
must not consider as different two values 
that are withm the range of reproducibility 
for the laboratory that he is using 

^Hetnoglobmoinetry A large variety of 
methods is available and no doubt too 
many unreliable techniques arc still used 
However the increasing popularity of pho- 
tometers and improved and stable standards 
have raised the quabty of hemoglobinomc 
tty The two most widely used procedures 
tc^ay arc ihev/tyanmcthemoglobm method 
and theoixyhemoglobin method The avail 
ability of certified and stable cyanmethemo- 
globm standards encourages wide use of 
this method 

The methods used in hemoglobmometry 
can be grouped into four main classes de- 
pending on the basic technique employed 
with variants within each class colorimct 
ric methods gasometnc methods specific 
gravity methods and chemical methods 
■/ Colorimetric Methods 

Principle Hemoglobin (Hb) is measured 
as oxyhemoglobin or is first converted Into 
one of several compounds such as acid 
hematin alkaline hematin cyanmethemo- 
globin and others less widely employed 
Tlie measurement is done by comparing the 
unknown sample with a standard The 
method of comparison may be visual or 
photoelectnc The latter is considerably 
more accurate

are based on the direct matching of the red

standard are not satisfactory

v^Ox) hemoglobin Method. A ividely used 
iTjethod is the determination of hemoglobin 
oxyhemoglobin. In this procedure 0.02 
ml. of blood measured with a Sahli -tvoe 
hemoglobin pipet is washed into S.QTml. ol 
approximately 0.007 N ammonium hydrox- 
/ ide solution prepared by adding 4 ml. of 
reagent grade NHiOH to 1 L. of water and 
mixing. Rinse pipet three times with dilut- 
ing fluid. The water used in the preparation 
of ammonia solution must be glass distilled, 
Vbecause minute amounts of copper in dis- 
tilled water or other diluents employed in 
oxyhemoglobin determinations may cause 
jbxyhemoglobin to be converted to methe- 
^oglobin and lower the values. Shake well 
to ensure mixing and oxygenation of hemo- 
globin. The solution Is read in a photometer 
using a green filter (540 m;*) and a 0.007 N 
ammonium hydroxide solution as blank. 
The test can be read ivithin a few seconds or 
tvlth a stoppered cuvet any time up to three 
days. The standard curi'e can be set up 
wtth one of the procedures to be listed later. 
\JCy.inmeihemoglobin Method. This method 
Is the outcome of the long-felt need for im- 
provement of standardization of hemoglobin 
determinations. 

In 1941 the British Medical Research 
Council instituted an extensive study of the 
problem of standardizing hemoglobinometry 
and emerged with a recommended analyt- 
ical procedure, a simple hemoglobinometer 
for general use, and a certified national 
hemoglobin standard for distribution to co- 
operating laboratories (King et al., 1948). 

In the United States the initiative was 
taken by the Army Medical Service Gradu- 
ate School ivith a limited field trial of a 
cyanmethemoglobin solution proposed by 
Drabkin (Crosby et al., 1954). The success 
of the Army plan so impressed the hema- 
tology study section of the National Insti- 
tutes of Health that it requested the Na- 
tional Research Council to explore the possi- 
bility of establishing a national hemo^obin 
standard for general use throughout the 
country. 

To this end the National Research Council 
established an ad hoc panel under the sub- 
committee on blood and related problems 
of the division of medical sciences. This 
panel has sought the cooperation of the 
College of American Pathologists, the Amer- 
ican Society of Clinical Pathologists, the 


Blood 73 

American Association of Blood Banks, the 
Department of Defense, the Veterans’ Ad- 
ministration, the National Institutes of 
Health, and the National Bureau of Stand- 
ards. It has also maintained close liaison 
with the Committee on Hemoglobinometry 
of the Medical Research Council of the 
United Kingdom and with the National Re- 
search Council of Canada. 

The panel gave serious consideration to 
the Bntish plan but decided that, in respect 
to simplicity and adaptability, the cyan- 
methemoglobin method adopted by the U.S. 
Army would be more suitable for use in the 
United States and Canada. Among the 
forms of hemoglobin well adapted to pho- 
tometry, c van methemoglQblrL_has outstand- 
ing advantages. All forms of henrnpabin 
likely to be found in blood, with the excep- 
tion of sulfmethemoglobin, are quantita- 
tively converted to cyanm ethemoglobi n 
upon the addition of a single reagent 

Solutions of cyanmethemoglobin are the 
most stable of the various hemoglobin pig- 
ments. Drabkin (1949) has kept similar 
solutions for six years without deteriora- 
tion. It is certainly safe to say that solutions 
of cyanmetbemoglobin arp_itable .for at 
least six months when kept in the refrig- 
erator. Another advantage of cyanmethemo- 
globin solutions is that they can be standard- 
ized accurately. The absorp^if band of 
cyanmethemoglobin m the region of 540 
is broad rather chan sharp, and conse- 
quently its solutions can be used m filter 
type photometers and in narrow band spec-'' 
Irophotometers. 

The first specirophotometric method for 
oxyhemoglobin was reported by Davis and 
Sbeard (1927), and the application of the 
photoelectric colorimeter for the determina- 
tion of the concentration of hemoglobin was 
first reported by Sheard and Sanford 
(1929). They used 0.1 per cent sodium car- 
bonate as diluent. This method was further 
improved by the development of the pho- 
telometer. 

Photoelectric colorimeters or photometers 
make it possible to determine hemoglobin 
with an accuracy of from ±2 to 5 per cent. 
However, this degree of accuracy, though 
possible, is not always achieved in practice. 
The main obstacle is the difficulty of stand- 
ardizing the instrument, especially for 
hemoglobinometry. “Recalibration” by the 
manufacturer is rarely reliable and fre- 
quently creates a false sense of security. 

To be reliable, standardization has to be 
done under the conditions prevailing in the

laboratory and must be checked frequently 
Several photometers are available Which 
ever is used it must be used exactly accord 
ing to the instructions provided by the 
manufacturer Cahbration of the instru 
raent is the first step The method differs 
with each make 

It is advisable to have an independent 
“photometnc” standard m addition to the 
c> anmethemoglobin standards This will 
help to check both the instrument and the 
cjanmethemoglobin standard if the pho- 
tometnc readings of the standard used in 
the test show excessive variations m dupU

Ptpets The 0 02 ml pipet (Sahli) that 
is used to measure the blood should be ae 
curate to S:1 per cent Several supply 
houses offer 0 02 ml pipets with a claimed 
accuracy of this order However it would 
appear advisable to calibrate a few such 
pipets m order to verify the degree of ac 
curacy (For techmque of cahbration see 
p 76 ff ) The pipets should be aad cleaned 
and thoroughly washed with water at least 
once a week They should be washed and 
thoroughly dried between each measure 
ment 

The transfer pipets used to measure the 
diluent solution should be of a good order of 
accuracy and preferably within ±0 5 per 
cent Some of the commercially available 
pipets are well within these limits (The 
Bureau of Standards tolerance on 5 ml 
pipets IS ±0 2 per cent ) If a buret or auto- 
matic pipet 1 $ used for this purpose it 
should be of the same order of accuracy 
The slandord The Principle Potas 
Slum femcyamde-cyamde solution is used 
Femcyamde conv erts hemoglobin iron from 
the ferrous to the feme state to form 
kethemoglobin which combines with potas- 
mum cyanide to produce the stable cy

The stock standard is available commer 
cially The exact concentration is within 2:2 
per cent of the value stated on the label It 
IS about 60 mg of cyanmethemoglobin per 
100 ml The spectrophotometric character 
istics of cyanmethemoglobm are such that 
D IS directly proportional to the concentra 
lion Three different concentrations of the 
reagent must be used for the preparation 
of a standard curve the one purchased con 
taimng 60 mg and two more with 40 and

and solutions of cyanide are poisonous and 
care should be taken to avoid getting them 
Into the mouth or inhabng their fumes 
Most clmical laboratories use for the de- 
termination of uric acid a reagent contain 
ing 50 gm of this salt per liter In mcw of 
this and of the fact that laboratories of 
clinical pathology are disciplined in the use 
of such dangerous niacenals as isotopes and 
varulem pathogens it would seem that the 
handling of the proposed reagent constitutes 
a quite negligible hazard 

The concentration of cyanide in the stock 
standard is 50 mg per liter The smallest 
dose of potassium cyanide that has been 
known to kill a human is 300 mg (Glaister, 
1945) The lethal dose for a man ap- 
proaches 4 liters (Sollmann 1948) Inmost 
chnical laboratories however this is not a 
substance to be handled b> irresponsible 
persons Especially the salt itself must be 
handled with great circumspection The

Before use the outside of the cuvets should 
be wiped free of moisture fingermarks and

to reach room temperature to prevent con 
densation on the cuvets and formation of 
bubbles when the cold solution is heated

where S is concentration of cyanmethemo

tration of the cyanmethemoglobin standard 
IS 60 4 and the dilution is 251, then 
604 X 251 

= 15 16 gm of hemoglobin 

per 100 ml 

The procedure may be facilitated by pre- 
paring a curve from which the readings of 
the galvanometer can be readily translated 
into hemoglobin values 

If the gah anometer readings are in terms 
of per cent of transmission (T), the read 
mgs of the standards are entered on semi 
logarithmic graph paper The abscissa (hot* 
tom axis) represents grams of hemoglobin 
and the ordmate, the percentage of light

three pomts It should pass through or very 
near T per cent = 100 This graph wiU 
show the value in grams of hemoglobin per 
100 ml correspondmg to each reading 
When many tests are done it may be more 
convenient to construct a table of hemo 
globm values for every possible pier cent 
reading Each photometer must be stand* 
ardized individually against the standards 
and should be checked frequently 

If the meter readings are m terms of 
density (D), the values are plotted on Imear 
graph paper wth the density values on the 
ordinate and the hemoglobin in grams per 
cent on the abscissa A line connecting the 
three points should pass through or very

be translated into grams of hemoglobin

^Specific Gjiavity Method 

The specific grawty of the biood Js the 
ratio of the weight of a volume of blood to 
the weight of the same volume of water at 
a temperature of 4® C The normal specific 
gravity ranges from I 048 to 1 066 The 
average for mtn is 1 057 and for women 
1053 There is a normal diurnal vanation 
of about 0 003 the values in the afternoon 
and after meals being somewhat lower and 
those after exercise and at night higher /

The copper sulfate meiJiod for meavunng

Method Venous blood is released mto the

of the drop docs not change for another 10

Chemical Methods 

The iron of the hemoglobin is separated 
by sulfuric acid the protein is precipitated 
and the iron is measured colonmetncally 
by comparison with a standard of known

Errors Inherent m the Methoii The al 
kali hematin methods have fevrer errors 
than the acid hematin procedures 
✓•■The low cost is probably responsible for 
the popularity of the acid hematin method 
and equipment (i c Sahli) in this country 
The cyanmetbemoglobin method has 
been studied exhaustively by a committee 
of the National Research Council and seems 
at present the method of choice for use with 
a photometer The use of cyanmeihemo- 
globm standard for calibration of the instru 
ment and for the test itself eliminates one 
major source of error Tlie broad absorption 
band of cyanmethemoglobm in the region of 
^/S40 m;i makes it convenient to use it both in 
filter type photometers and in narrow band 
spectrophotometers With the exception of 
sulfbcmoglobin all other varieties of hemo- 
■^globin are converted to cvanmeihemoglobin 
Errors Inherent in the Equipment The 
accuracy of equipment is not uniform and

per cent or more A higher pnee docs no»

The British Medical Research Council rcc 
ommended in 1948 the gray wedge photom 
eter a simple instrument that measures 
the optical density of colored liquid in dav 
light or with artificial light (MacFarlane 
eta! 1948) In general an insirujrent cm

The Bix»od 


jTioglobm in a sample of undiluted blood 
reduces the sources of error 

The introduction of photometry has been 
a great advance, but photoelectric instru 
mcnts are probably even more subject to 
error than are the less complicated instiu 
ments Tbej are potentially better, but just 
as other machines they must be calibrated 
at the beginning under conditions of actual 
operation in the laboratory and must be 
rechccked at frequent intervals The wave 
length setting, the filters, and the meter 
readings are some of the items requiring 
constant checking 

The calibration of the Instruments can be 
done with one of several reliable methods 
Some of them, i c , iron and oxygen capacity 
methods, are complicated and consequently 
not widely used On the other hand the 
cyanmethcmoglobln method as a method 
for standardization has the advantages of 
simplicity and inexpensiveness Crystalline 
human hemoglobin prepared according to 
Drabkin*s method is a solution containing 
l_milliatojn of hemoglobin iron per liter 
The three commercially available standards 
with certified concentrations of approxi* 
mately ilO, 40, and CO mg of hemoglobin 
per 100 ml In the form of cyanmethemo- 
globln have been found to be stable for 
years When the metliod is used with a 
properly standardized and regularly checked 
photometer, the error of the cyanmethemo 
globin method can be reduced to a:2 per 
cent This is worth noting, especially be 
cause hemoglobin pipets may have an error 
as high as :t5 per cent Calibration of 
pipets and matching of cuvets will lessen 
these sources of errors inherent in equip 
ment 

Operator’s Errors Most of the so called 
human errors are the same in all technical 
procedures They can be reduced by good 
training meticulous understanding of the 
chnical significance of the test and of the 
necessity for a dependable method adber 
ence to oral and vvntten instructions of the 
principles of the method and familiarity 
with the equipment and with the sources 
of error The technologist should be well 
trained in the performance of critical vol 
umetry and be familiar with the perform 
ance of his instrument to be able to identify 
its misbehavior The technologist who is 
patient and critical by nature and by tram 
mg and who is interested not only in the 
uhat and hoio of his work, but also in the 
why, will be less prone to make errors than 
the one not so constituted

The matching of colors is a source of 
errors which can be reduced by not per- 
mitting the eye to get tired 

Abnormal Hemoglobin Pigments 

The two physiologic hemoglobins the 
oxyhemoglobin and the reduced hemo 
globin are readily converted into a senes 
of compounds through the action of acids 
alkalies, oxidizing and reducing substances 
heat, and other agents Lesser concentra 
tions can be distinguished with the spectro 
scope If the amounts present are still 
smaller (less than 10 per cent) and for 
quanutative measurements, spectrophoto 
metric, oalorimetnc, and gasometric nieth 
ods have to be used 

•-^Icthomoglobin Methemoglobin (fern 
hemoglobin) is a derivative of hemoglobin 
in which the ferrous iron is oxidized to the 
ferric state, methemoglobin (MHb) it con 
sists of one molecule of glohm and four 
molecules of hemin (with the iron m the 
feme state) 

Methemoglobin (MHb) is part of the ‘in 
active” hemoglobin a is unable to combine 
reversibly with oxygen and carbon monox 
Jdc In addition MHb causes a shift of the 
oxygen dissoaation curve and hinders the 
transfer of oxygen from the blood to the 
tissues Thus, abnormal amounts of MHb 
will result in a functional ‘anemia with 
cyanosis (due to the decreased oxygen 
carry’ing capacity of the blood) A degree 
of cyanosis, comparable to the presence of 
S gm of reduced hemoglobin (Hb) per 100 
ml , will be evident with 1 5 gm of the 
methemoglobin (MHb) or with less than 

mg of sulfhemoglobin (SHb) per 100 
ml 

It IS beheved that 99 6 per cent of the iron 
in hemoglobin exists in the ferrous state 
(Hb) and 0 4 per cent m the feme state 
(MHb) A smaU amount of MHb is always 
teing formed, but it is reduced by the en 
zyme systems within the erythrocytes GIu 
cose is believed to be necessary as a sub 
stratc for this reduction of the MHb back 
to Hb It has been reported that normal 
Subjects may have up to 0 24 gm of MHb 
per 100 ml of blood, the average normal 
concentration of MHb, however, is about 
0 06 gm per 100 ml 

'' An absence of the reducing enzyme sys 
terns will result in large amounts of MHb 
being present This is seen in primary (or 
congenital) methemoglobinemia in which 
an equihbnum is reached at about 40 per 
cent methemoglobin. polycythemia may be

present as a compensatory mechanism At 
concentrations of 20 per cent mcthemoglo- 
bin, working subjects complain of mild 
fatigue and have abnormally high blood 
lactic acid levels Howeser lc\els of 30 to 
50 per cent MHb may occur without pro 
ducing severe symptoms The lethal concen- 
tration in dogs IS 85 to 90 per cent MHb. 
the exact le\el at which coma and death 
occur in man is not known 

Most cases of methemoglobinemia are 
classified as secondary methemoglobinemia 
These are due mainly to poisoning with 
drugs and chemicals, especially those con 
taming the nitro or amino groups These 
are aniline and its den\atives, nitrates 
nitrites and some sulfonamides Recently 
ferrous sulfate has been reported to produce 
methemoglobinemia after ingestion of very 
largo doses 

There follows an alphabetical list of 
drugs chemical (oxidizing) compounds 
and some ‘bacteria” that change Hb to 
methemoglobin This has been compiled 
from the work of Finch 1948 Goodman 
and Gilman 1955, Michel and Harris 1940, 
and Smith et al 1950

,/Methemoglobm (MHb) is reduced back 
to Hb by the erythrocyte enzyme system It 
can also be reduced (slowly) by the admin 
istration of reducing agents such as 
corbic acid or sulfhydryl compounds (gluta- 
thione, "cysteine, BAL), these arc of value 
in the cases of primary methemoglobinemia 
when there is an impaired cell reconversion 
mechanism In cases of secondary met* 
hemoglobinemia, mcthj^lenejiluc is of great 
value, us rapid action is not based on its

cyanide, the therapy of cyanide poisoning Is 
to administer nitriles to form MHb which 
then combines with the cyanide Thus, the 
free cyanide (which is extremely poisonous 
to the cellular respiratory enzymes) becomes 
less toxic when changed to cyanmeihemo- 
globin (MHbCN) 

The Tioniini individual may have up to 
0 24 gm of MHb per 300 ml of blood 
The aicrage normal concentration is about 
0 4 per cent of the total hemoglobin or about 
OOG gm of MHb per 100 ml of blood

not necessarily correlated with the concen

SMiriiemoglobni In the presence of oxy 
gen, htmoglobln reacts with hydrogen sul 
fide to form a greenish derivative of 
hemoglobin called sulibcmoglobln Since

assumed that oxyhemoglobin reacts dlrcctlv 
with the II-S 

Sulfhcmoglobln cannot transport oxygen.

but It can combine with CO to form car 
boxysulfhemoglobin The concentration of 
sulfhemoglobin in vivo is as a rule within 
the range of a fei\ per cent and seldom ex- 
ceeds 10 per cent Unlike methemoglobln, 
it remains m the corpuscles until they 
break doivn 

Sulfhemoglobin has been reported in pa 
Uents receiving treatment with sulfona- 
mides, aromatic amine drugs (phenacetm 
acetamlid), and sulfur as well as in those 
wth severe constipation, in cases of bac- 
teremia due to Clostndhim ivelchii, and in 
a condition known as enterogenous cyanosis 

Formation of sulfhemoglobin in these 
conditions is caused by HoS, which is the 
result of bacterial action on sulfur com 
pounds in the intestine 

Carbon Monoxide Hemoglobin (Carboxy- 
hcmoglobm. HbCO) Hemoglobin has the 
capacity to combine with carbon monoxide 
in the same proportion as wuh oxygen 
However, the affinity of tlie hemoglobin 
molecule for carbon monoxide is 210 times 
greater This means that carbon monoxide 
will bind with hemoglobin even if its con 
centratlon in the air is extremely low (eg 
0 02 to 0 04 per cent) In those cases, 
HbCO will build up more and more until 
typical symptoms of poisomng appear 

HbCO cannot bind oxygen and therefore 
is not available as an oxygen earner Fur 
thennore. the HbOs-HbCO muxture does not 
release oxygen so readily as is done in 
normal blood, thus adding to the anoxia If 
a patient poisoned with carbon monoxide 
receives pure oxygen, the conversion of 
HbCO to HbOj IS greatly enhanced HbCO 
is light sensitive and has a tjTJical, bnlbant, 
cherry red color 

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning has 
long been well known Chronic poisoning, 
due to prolonged exposure to small amounts 
of carbon monoxide, is less well known but 
is assuming increasing importance The 
chief sources of the gas are gasoline motors, 
illuminating gas gas heaters and defective 
stoves and furnaces Exposure to carbon 
monoxide is thus one of the hazards of 
modem civilization The gas has even been 
found in the air of busy streets of large 
cities in suffiaent concentration to cause 
mild symptoms in persons such as traffic 
pobcemen, who arc long exposed to it 

Henderson and Haggard found ihit 
healthy persons exposed to various concen 
trations of the gas for an hour do not ex 
perience definite symptoms (headache 
dizziness, muscular weakness, and nausea) 


SI 

unless the concentration of the gas In the 
bloixi reaches 26 or 30 per cent of satura 
toon, but it appears that in chronic poison 
ing, especially in children, serious symptoms 
mav occur with lower concentrauons The 
figures reported for cases of clmical poison 
mg are often misleading since the carbon 
monoxide largelv or wholly disappears from 
the blood after the patient has breathed 
pure air for a few hours although the symp 
toms may continue for a long time 

Tests for Alinonnal Hemoglobin Pig- 
ments Some information can be obtained 
by naked eye examination of the blood spcci 
men Normal appearance of the serum or 
plasma identifies the red cells as the site of 
the pigment Shalung of normal whole 
blood in the air for 15 minutes imparts to 
It a bright red color as the reduced bcnio 
globm IS converted to oxyhemoglobin The 
blood IS cherry red when the pigment is 
carfaoxyhcmoglobin in carbon monoxide 
poisoning The color is chocolate brown in 
methemoglobinemia and mauve lavender in 
sulfhemoglobinemia 

The specimen must be obtained carcfollv 
to avoid hemolysis and promptly because 
the abnormal pigment, unlike hemoglobin 
disappears rapidly on cessation of exposure 
and on institution of therapy If carbon mon 
oxide IS suspected dry sodium citrate In 
small well stoppered tubes should be used 
If mcthcmoglobin is to be tested for, hep- 
arin IS the anticoagulant of choice because 
oxalate lends to elevate the pH and favors 
conversion of neutral to alkaline methemo- 
globin For all other tests, drv oxalate anti 
coagulant is preferable Plasma containing 
plasma hemoglobin is pink or red and brow n 
in the presence of methemogteWn or met- 
hemalbunnn The red cells and the pb'ima 
or serum must be examined 

Idcniification of Hemoglobin I’igtneniv 
Whole blood or washed red cells are added 
to distilled water in a ratio of 1 to 10 or 1 to 
100 depending on the concentration of the 
abnormal pigment A few milllJjtcrs of the 
hemolyzed blood are placed In each of two 
test tubes In the case of methemoglobin 
and meihemaJbumin a dark bind is seen in 
the spectroscope between G20 and C30 mllll 
microns in the red portion of the spectrum 
between the Frauenhofer lines C and D 
Sulfhemoglobin produces a simlhr bind at 
618 m^i To distinguish the pigments, two 
to three drops of a 5 per cent sohillon of 
potassium cyanide are added (v%lih i 
dropper not a pipet) to the second itilx' 
with blood The bind will disjpprir If the

pigment is methemoglobin and the color 
of the specimen will change from brown or 
black to dark red but not if it is sulfbemo 
globin or methemalbumm Three per cent 
hydrogen peroxide causes the bands of sulf 
hemoglobm and methemoglobin to disap 
pear Carboxj hemoglobm and oxyhemo- 
globin are difficult to distinguish with the 
spectroscope Both produce bands at ap 
proximately the same location (576 m;i) 

Other tests Naked eye examination of 
diluted blood (one drop m 5 ml of water) 
shows a yellowish red color of oxyhemo- 
globm and pinkish or bluish red color of 
carboxyhemoglobui 

Aucali Test Two drops each of nor 
mal blood and of the patients blood are 
placed on spot plate Two drops of 25 per 
cent sodium hydroxide are added to each 
Carboxyhemoglobm remains unchanged 
The normal control turns brown 

A simple quahtative test may be use- 
ful in an emergency and \viU be descnbed 

Katayamas Test (1888) This is one 
of the best of the simple tests for carbon 
monoxide hemoglobm It inll detect as little 
as 10 per cent of saturation Place about 10 
ml of water in each of two test tubes To one 
tube add five drops of the suspected blood 
and to the other add fi^e drops of normal 
blood to sene as a control To each tube 
add five drops of fresh orange colored am 
momum sulfide Mix genUy and make 
faintly acid with aceuc acid The color of 
blood containing carbon monoxide hemo 
globin becomes more or less rose red de 
pending on the concentration of the gas 
normal blood becomes a dirty greenish 
brown 

Carbon Monoxide Hemoglobin (Hb-

^ Spectropholometnc Identification of He 
moglobins The vanous hemoglobins ha\e 
charactenstic absorpnon spectra which can 
be determined easily provided the labora 
tory is equipped with a spectrophotometer 
Hemoglobm for instance has an absorption 
maximum at 565 Oxyhemoglobin has 
maxima at 514 544 8 576 9 and 640 2 
mu Carboxyhemoglobm is characterized by 
an absorption peak of 535 and 570 9 ni^ 
Methemoglobin has maxima at 500 540 
578 and 634 m/i and cyanmethemoglohm 
has Its maximum at 414 and 540 mp 


I VBORATOR\ Methods 

The identification of different forms of 
hemoglobms by determining the absorption 
spectrum can be earned out in a \ery simple 
way Approxunately one half of a drop of 
blood is put into a test tube and diluted with 
approximately 20 ml of deionized or 
double-distiUed water The actual dilution of 
the hemoglobin depends on the concentra 
tion of the hemoglobm (e g if the hemo- 
globm is extremely low one might ha\e to 
add less water if the hemoglobin content is 
high one might have to dilute the specimen 
more) For maximal accuracy the peak of 
absorption should be somewhere between 60 
and 40 per cent transmittance After the 
blood has been diluted with water samples 
are read m a spectrophotometer using water 
as the blank (The Beckman B or the Beck 
man DU Spectrophotometer is very saus 
factory for iis determmation ) The absorp- 
tion IS read at intervals of 5 m^i between 
620 and 500 mp (see Fig 4-5) 

In the differentiation between oxyhenio- 
globm and carbon monoxide hemoglobm 
one can take advantage not only of the 
different absorption spectrum but also of 
the follo\ving charactenstic In the case of 
pure oxyhemoglobin the absorption at 
576 5 mu will be greater than that at 544 8 
m /1 In tne case of carboxyhemoglobin how 
ever the absorption at 570 5 m^ will be less 
than that at 535 m/i (see Fig 4-5) 


The Blood Cell Cotmt 

The study of the blood in the laboratory 
can be divided mto two large groups of tests 
rests used pnman’iy ior the diagnt&h. tA 
diseases of blood to be discussed next and 
tests used primanly for the diagnosis of 
diseases of other organs to be discussed in 
other chapters 

The diagnostic tests for diseases of blood 
consist of two large groups the chemical 
and the morphologic The former deal ^\^lh 
hemoglobin and its abnormalities TJie mor 
phologic studies are divided into quanuta 
me and qualitative tests 

The quantftame tests are concerned with 
the numbers of red blood cells w hue blood 
cells and platelets in a cubic millimeter 
In the qualitative tests tlie appearance and 
structure of these cells are analy’zed and 
classified in stamed blood films

the pipets are arbitrary The \olume of the 
red cell pipet is made up of one-half part at 
the level of the 0 5 mark one part at the 
level of the 1 0 mark and 100 parts in the 
bulb When the blood js drawn to the 0 5

all the blood cells are washed into the bulb 
and the resulting dilution in the bulb is 1 to

has been filled vMth the blood and the dilut

the pipet contains no blood but only dilut

draivn to the 0 5 mark and diluted to the 11 
mark the dilution is 1 to 20 Again the cell 
free fluid m the capillary is not included in 
the total volume 

According to the U S Bureau of Stand 
ards the pennissible error of the red cell 
pipet is -*-5 per cent and of the white cell 
pipet ±3 5 per cent Thirty six blood count 
mg pipets sold by three manufacturers \vith 
a guarantee to be accurate nithin ±5 
per cent were checked by the National 
Bureau of Standards Twenty three were 
found to be accurate according to the Bu 
reau of Standards allowable error of s:5 
per cent in 8 the enor was *10 per cent 
in 2 *15 per cent and m 3 *25 per cent 
(Cartivnght 1958) This shows that the 
only reliable guarantee is to purchase red 
cell pipets wath a Bureau of Standards cer 
tificatiOD or to send them to the Bureau of 
Standards for certification This ^viU prowde 
a correction factor for both the 1 to 100 and 
1 to 20 dilution 

The Trenner automatic pipet (Fig 4-8) 
IS so constructed that the capillary tube is 
filled by capillary attraction and the blood 
stops automatically at the end of the tube 
This provides an accurate control of the 
blood column and eliminates this source of 
error The pipet is more expensue and more 
fragile 

The rubber tubing that is attached to the 
pipet should be sufficiently hea^’y walled to 
resist collapse during suction and should be 
long enough (at least 10 mcbes) to permit 
easy reading of the graduation marks 

After use pipets s’lould be rmsed with 
tap water and then three tiroes iMth dis

capiUaiy end shaking and emptying 
through the large bore end This is followed

The central platforms or "floor pieces’* ate 
exactly 0 1 mm lower than the lateral plat- 
forms Each of the centra! platforms has a 
so-called improved Neubauer ruling, which 
consists of a square measuring 3x3 mm

which measures 0 05 X 0 05 mm The total 
number of the smallest 0 05 x 0 05 mm 
squares in the central square is 400 As a 
rule, five of the tertiary squares, amounting 
to 80 of the smallest squares, are used for 
red cell counts (It is customary to count 
the four comer and the central tcrti3r> 
squares )

both red and white corpuscles without the 
necessity for cleaning and re fillin g the

two rulings for counting erythrocytes are 
the improved Neubauer inhngs the two ad 
ditionsd ruhngs for counting leukocytes are 
the Fuchs Rosenthal rulings which ong 
mally were designed for counting cells in 
spinal fluid but are very convenient because 
of the large area for making leukocyte 
counts 

For cell counts in cerebrospmal fluid and 
other fluids with relauvely small numbers 
of cells the Levy counting chamber with 
the Fuchs Rosenthal ruling is convenient It 
has a depth of 0 2 mm The ruling consists 
of 16 one millimeter squares mth cnple 
boundary Imes Each square is subdivided 
into 16 smaller squares The cells in the 
entire ruled area (16 sq mm ) are counted 
The number of cells counted is divided by 
16 to give the number per square milluneier 
This IS muluplied by the diluUon factor and 
by 5 to give the number of cells per cubic

"^ED Cell Diluting Fluids 
Requirements The diluting fluid must be 
^isotomc to prevent lysis and crenation of the 
red cells It should also contain a fixative 
to preserve the shape of the erjihroc>tes to 
prevent autolysis and aggluunaiion and 
thus to make it possible to do the count even 
several hours after the sample was obtained 
If necessary 

Of the many diluLng fluids that have 
been used in the course of time the follow

CoUNTINC THE ReD CeLLS 
This procedure consists of the following 
steps drawing the blood and diluting the 
sample charging the counting chamber 
counting the cells and calculating the re 
suit and cleamng the pipets and chamber 
in preparation for the next count 

The Simple The skin is cleansed and 
sterilized the puncture made and the first 
drop of blood wiped o/F The pipet is held 
honzontally at nearlj a nght angle to the 
line of vision so that the exact height of the 
column may be seen easily The side of the 
Up should rest against the skin but the end 
must be free and the Up immersed in the 
drop of blood The red counting pipet with 
the lOI mark is filled from the second drop 
sucking the blood to the mark 0 5 or 1 ac 
cording to the dilution desired 

Com/flicatiori I Air bubbles may enter 
into the pipet with the blood This Is a sure 
sign that one of three things Is happening 




The 

The drop is too small or the tip is not kept 
immersed m it or the tip is damaged 

If tenous blood is used the procedure has 
to be modified accordinglj The bottle or 
tube with the blood must be inverted or ro- 
tated gently but long enough to assure com 
plete mixing and even distribution of the 
corpuscular elements immediately before 
the pipct IS immersed 

Cmnlthcalton 2 The blood may use be 
N/^ond the mark This can be corrected by 
touching the tip of the pipet to a moistened 
towel or a finger tip The blood will be 
drawn back to the mark If a large excess of 
blood has been drawn up the pipet should 
be cleaned and the procedure repeated be 
cause even though ir is withdrawn enough 
will remain adhering to the inside of the 
pipet to introduce a sigmficant error Pains 
takingly accurate technique in this part of 
the procedure is important because an> 
error is magnified 200 times by the subse 
quent dilution 

The blood adhering to the tip is wiped off 
quickly the tip is plunged into the diluting 
fluid and the fluid is sucked up to the mark 
101 rotating the pipet slightly meanwhile 
Again while doing so it is best to hold the 
pipet nearly horizontally m order to avoid 
aspiration of ait bubbles in the bulb but 
when the bulb is almost full the pipet should 
be raised to the vertical position At this 
stage the blood sample has been diluted 1 
to 200 or 1 to lOQ dependingon the amount 
of blood taken ^E^cepI in cases of severe 
anemia a dilution of 1 to 200 is preferably 
At this stage the ends of the pipet are closed 
with the thumb and middle finger and the 
pipet IS shaken for about 30 seconds to fa 
cilitate the initial mixing The bead con 
tamed m the bulb should move freely The 
shaking should be done at a 90 degree angle 
to the long axis of the pipet If capillary 
blood is used all these steps must be earned 
out rapidly to prevent coagulation before 
blood IS mixed with the diluting fluid 

To fill the Trenner automatic pipet (Fig 
4~8) the blood is drawn by suction into the 
capillary portion until it is nearly full The 
suction is discontinued and if the pipet is 
held nearly horizontallj the blood will con 
linue to nse to the end of the capillary 
portion and will automatically stop there 
The diluting fluid is then immediately 
drawn in by suction as described for the 
Thoma pipet 

AVhen It is not convenient to count the 
eryihrocyies at once a heav^ rubber band 
Is placed around the pipet so as to dose 


Rlood qy 

both ends A small piece of rubber cloth or 
other tough nonabsotbent material may be 
inserted if necessary to prevent the lip 
fmm punching through the rubber In this 
manner the sample may be presened in 
usable condition for 24 hours or longer 
Charging ihc Counting Chamber When 
the counting chamber and the coverglass 
have been cleaned the coverglass is ad 
justed and clamped in place if the counting 
chamber is supplied with clamps Tiie pipet 
IS held between the thumb and middle 
finger or in a special shaking machine and 
shaken for two to three minutes at right 
angles to the long axis of the pipet \ 
method for mixing b> hand is as follows 
One or two pipets arc held beiwccn the 
thumb and fingers of one band The base ol 
the hand is struck against the base of the 
other hand at a rate of 60 times per minute 
for three minutes The first three to four 
drops arc blown off to eUmimte the ceil 
free fluid from the capillary tube The pipet 
is held at an angle of about 35 degrees 
while the tip is touched to the angle be- 
tween the edge of the coverglass and one of 
the projecting ends of the floor piece TIic 
fluid will run under the coverglass b> capil 
lary attraction The fluid is allowed to enter 
m a controlled manner This can be done 
by pressure from the index finger on the 
open end of the pipet or from the pressure 
of the tongue on the mouth piece of the 
pipet Care must be exercised to permit just 
enough fluid to fill the space L^ncath the 
coverglass This is especially important 
when the chamber lacks clamps since an 
excess of fluid will tend to raise the cover 
glass appreciably and increase the crythro 
cyte count A small excess remaining at the 
mouth of the counting chamber can be re 
moved b> touching the drop genii) with the

The prtttctfile of coiuitwg The square 
millimeter Yvith its 400 small squares in the 
center of the ruled area has a capacity of 

0 1 cu mm One has to find the number 
of erythrocytes in the square millimeter 
multiply by 10 to find the number in 1 cu 
min of the diluted blood, and finally mul 
tiply by the dilution to find the number in 

1 cu mm of undiluted blood Instead of 
actually countmg all the erythrocytes, it is 
customary to count those in only a limited 
number of small squares and calculate the 
number in the square millimeter for the di 
lution_o f- l_t o_ 200 The \olume of diluted 
blood contained in the chamber abote the 
80 small squares-— five groups of 16 each — 
IS 0 02 cu mm The number of erythrocytes 
counted in these 80 small squares is multi 
phed by 50 to comert the number found m 

0 02 cu mm to the number contained m 

1 0 cu mm The number in 1 0 cu mm is 
multiplied fay 200 to correct for the dliulion 
of 1 to 200 The combmed conversion fac 
tor IS 50 X 200 = 10,000 

In practice a convenient procedure is as 
follows With a dilution of 1 to 200, count 
the erythrocytes in 80 small squares and 
to the sum add four zeros With the dilu 
non of 1 to 100, count 40 small squares 
and add four zeros Thus, if with I to 200 
dilution 450 erythrocytes were counted m 
80 squares the total count would be 4,500, 
000 for each cubic milliraeier This method 
IS sufficiently accurate for most clinical 
purposes, provided the erythrocytes are 
evenly distributed It is comement to count 
five blocks of 16 small squares (Fig 4-14), 
one m each comer of the square millimeter 
and one in the center When usmg the 
“double countmg chamber,” it is convement 
to count the erj throcy tes m 20 small 
squares at the top and those m 20 small 
squares at the bottom m each of the ruled 
poruons, makmg 80 squares in all, and to 
add four zeros In order to avoid confusion 


in counting erythrocytes that he on the 
^nlerllnes, the foUowmg rule is generally 
/adopted Erythrocytes that touch any one of 
’*-''lhe three lines or the single hne on the 
left or the top borders of the small square 
should be counted as though they were 
within the squares, but those that touch 
any of the Imes on the ngbt and the bottom 
borders of the small squares should not be 
counted In this way no cell is counted 
twice The cells are counted m each small 
square, first from left to right, begmmng 
WTth the top of four small squares, and 
then from right to left for the next row, and 
so on The number of cells for each of the 
five groups of 16 squares is recorded sep- 
arately and the results are added 

When the number of red cells is ex 
cessively high, e g . in polycythemia greater 
accuracy is achieved by draw mg the blood 
in the pipef onlj up to the 0 3 mark The 
counting is done in the usual way, but the# 
conversion factor m Jg of 10 000 or 16 667i 
Example the number of red cells counted 
in 80 small squares was 500 With the usual 
muluphcauon factor of 10,000 the result 
vvould have been 5 000,000 Owing to 
smaller sample the conversion factor will 
be 16 667 and the result. 8,333 500 HBC 
per cu mm 

Conversely, in anemia the number of red 
cells may be too small for accurate meas 
urement To correct for this, the blood 
should be drawn up to the 1 0 mark mstead 
of the 0 5 mark The dilution will be 1 to 
100 and the conversion factor, 5000 Instead 
of 10,000 Example the total number of 
Cells counted was 400 The red cell count 
win be 400 x 5000 = 2 000 000 

Another way of counting in anemias is 
to count cells in more squares than the 
standard five The conversion factor will 
vary acconlmglv 5000 if 10 squares are 
counted, 3333 if 15 squares are counted 
2500 if 20, and 2000 if 25 squares are 
counted, the latter being the maximum pos 
sible in one chamber Example Blood was 
diluted 1 to 200, 400 cells were counted 
m 25 large squares or a total of 400 small 
Squares The conversion factor is 2000 and 
the total red blood cell count, 8 000.000 
Sources of error. Counting erythrocytes 
is a procedure abounding with errors It is 
probably the oldest micromethod m clinical 
pathology and consequently has the same 
sources of error that are common to all 
micromethods In addition it is afflicted with 
other possible errors characteristically us 
own The various sources of errors can be 



The 

classified as foUoivs Errors due to the sire 
of the sample or to the nature of the sam 
pie, the operators error, errors due to equip- 
ment, and the so-called una%oidahle errors 
(errors of the field, the counting chamber, 
and the pipet)

to delay in mixing ivith the anticoagulant, 
and hemolysis are some of the sources of 
possible errors. The distribution of the cells 
in the plasma changes rapidly due to sedi- 
mentation. Failure to mLx the blood thor- 
oughly and immediately before drawing the 
sample into pipet is bound to introduce an 
error, which is directly proportionate to the 
degree of sedimentation during the interval 
since the blood ivas mixed. This is ac- 
centuated in a variety of diseases in which 
the sedimentation is significantly acceler- 
ated. The fact that the specimen is a sus- 
pension and that the cells have to be in a 
uniform suspension in order to he counted 
correctly opens the door to other possible 
errors. Currents of all kinds may alter the 
uniformity of the suspension. Yeast cells 
grooving in contaminated dUuting fluid may 
be mistaken for erythrocytes. 

The Operator’s Errors. Here belong 
errors due to faulty technique, such as may 
occur when blood and the diluting fluid arc 
draivn into the pipet (use of an unclean or 
wet pipet or failure to wipe off the pipet 
tip), and errors introduced when the cham- 
ber is loaded and when the cells are 
counted. A frequent source of trouble is 
faulty application of the coverglass. espe- 
cially when it is raised by introduction of 
an excess of diluted blood, or movement of 
the coverglass after the counting chamber 
has been filled. Overflowing of the suspen- 
sion into the moat is another example. This 
may reduce the count by as much as 1,000,- 
OOO. The number of technical errors of this 
kind is legion. They can be reduced to a 
minimum in the hands of an e.xperienced 
technologist. 

Errors due to Equipment. Inac- 
curacies in the graduations of the pipets and 
of the ruled areas of the counting chambers 
are frequent sources of error. They can be 
avoided by using pipets certified by the 
U.S. Bureau of Standards. Faulty construc- 
tion may be responsible for inaccuracy in 
depth of the counting chamber. 

Cleanmg of the counting chamber with 
alcohol or exposure to excessive heat or 
intensive sunbght may soften the cement 
that holds the counung platform. The con- 
struction of the coverglass may also be 
faulty. 

The So-called “Normal” Error of 
THE Count. This occurs even if all usual 
precautions have been taken to avoid errors 
that have been listed. When all errors in- 
herent in the sample, technique, and equip- 
ment are controlled and two chambers are 


Laboratory Methods 

filled from each of two pipets and the cells 
are counted in each chamber, the error 
amounts to ±11 per cent. Accordingly, if 
the true red cell count is 5,000,000. chance 
distribution of the cells in the chamber may 
be responsible for variation from 4,450,000 
to 5,550,000 per cu. mm. When fewer Aan 
400 cells are counted or when only one 
pipet is used, the error may be as high as 
±22 per cent. 

In doing a red cell count, one uses an 
extremely small sample. It is a common ob- 
servation that different samples of the same 
batch differ one from the other. According 
to the method recommended here, erythro- 
cytes in 80 squares are counted. It is ob- 
vious that one will not get the identical 
count if one particular set of 80 of the 400 
available squares rather than another is 
used. This does not indicate necessarily 
maldistribution of the erythrocytes because 
of poor mi.xing. Each erythrocyte that enters 
the chamber takes a position among the 
400 squares "at random.” The distribution 
of erythrocytes in the counting chamber 
follows the law of chance, and consequently 
there Is a variation of the number of erythro 
cytes which fall into each square. The 
chance distnbution of the cells in the cham- 
ber introduces an inherent error, which 
cannot be controhed. 

According to Pois son’s distribution, 

the variation amob'g'the mfferent squares 
in the chamber is given by the formula 
S.D. =5 Vm where m is the mean number 
of erythrocytes per unit area and S.D. is the 
standard deviation* of the counts in these 
areas. Example: The mean count per 80 
squares is 500 (as for a count of 5,000,000 
per cu. mm.). The S.D. of counts of dif- 
ferent sets of 80 squares in the chamber 
will be V500 or 22.4. Expressed relatively 
22 4 

as a per cent, this is g— X 100 = 4.5 per 
cent. 

Between ±1 S.D. are included two-thirds 
of the repeated counts; 67 per cent of the 
results based on chance distribution are in- 
cluded within one standard deviation on 
each side of the mean. Between ±2 S.D. on 
each side of the mean are included 95 per 
cent of repeated counts. Deviations falling 
outside the range of twice the standard 

• The standard deviation is a measure of variabil- 
ity Riven by the forniula\/v(x— m)- where x is the

observation the variation of which is measured, m 
is the mean or average, N is the number of observa- 
tions, and Z stands for summation. 



91 


The Bloou 


deviation are as a rule due to errors in 
technique. 

Since ±2 S.D. is generally accepted as a 
significant limit, the error of a count of 
5,000,000 per cu. mm. made in the bemo- 
cytometer chamber o^ving merely to the 
variation in the field of observation is 
S:2 X 4.5 = ±9 per cent. This “error of 
the field" measured as S.D. = Vm is the 
minimal error to which a single estimate 
of the count can be considered subject as 
long as the hemocytometer is used, but the 
error due to variation \vithin the field of 
observation is not the only one to which 
the count as usually made is subject. Sep- 
arate fillings of different standard cham- 
bers with the same blood \viU result in 
different total counts per measured unit 
volume in the different chambers otving to 
variations in calibration, variations in the 
filling technique, and variations in pressure 
of the coverglass. This may be referred to as 
the “error of the c/«anj6er.“ 

Similarly, separate fillings of different 
standard pipets with the same blood will 
result in different total counts per meas- 
ured unit volume in the different pipets. 
This may be referred to as the “error of 
the pipet." Berkson et al. (1940) have de- 


termined the S.D. of the pipet error as 4.7 
per cent of the mean count. For the total 
e rror, they gave for a count of 5,000,000 
^4^1= + 4.6- + 4.7- = 7.7* or about 8 per 
cent. Since twice the S.D. is the usually 
accepted limit of significance, the error of 
a single estimate of the erythrocyte count 
was given by them as ±:16 per cent. 

A large number of repeated counts of this 
kind will of course vary, and 95 per cent of 
them will be within the limits of *16 per 
cent; 68 per cent, or about two-thirds, will 
be within *8 per cent. Figure 4-15 shows 
the distribution of repeated estimates for 
a total count of 5,000,000 per cu. mm. 

The conclusions of those who investi- 
gated the sources of error of erythrocyte 
counts can be summarized as follows. The 
degree of inaccuracy is greatest when only 
one pipet and one chamber are used. The 
accuracy and reproducibUity increase with 
the increased number of cells counted but 

* The total error ts given as the square root of

as 4.5 per cent. The 4.$ per cent Is the error of the 
chamber.

interval For instance, betiveen 5.000.000 and 5,100,000 there will be 10 2 per cent of the counts The 
standard deviation (S D.) of the counts is 380,000. and from this may be calculated the frequency of counts 
falling in any interval. Between =0 67 S.D. (the probable error) will fall 50 per cent of the counts; hence, 
one may expect 50 per cent to fall beiu een 4,740,000 and S.260.000. Between *3 S.D. w ill fall 68 cent

The Macromethod of Mintrobe (I9 j 6) i 
Equipment The Wmtrobe hematocnt tube 
IS a thick walled glass tube with a uniform \ 
mtemal bore and a flattened bottom It is 
graduated m milhmeters from 0 to 105 and 
has a rubber cap to prevent evaporation 
during the long period of rentnfugation 
(Fig 4-16) 

Of the various forms of fillmg pipets 
available a 2 ml syringe with a needle 
long enough to reach the bottom of the 
hematocnt tube is probably as good as any 
and quite practical 

The essential reqmrement of a centnfuge 
is that It generate a centrifugal field of not 
less than 2500 G at the bottom of the cup 
Angle head centrifuges with an inchnation 
of not more than 45° are widely used

latter can be used only if not less than 
3 ml and preferably 5 ml of blood is col 
lected 

Procedure The oxalated or heparimzed 
blood must be mixed thoroughly by not less 
than 30 slow and complete inversions of the 

I container Rolling the bottle is madequate 
and shaking is stdl worse because it may 
damage the ceUs 

After adequate mLxmg the hematocnt 
tube is filled usuig the fillmg pipet or a 
syringe preferably in one operation The 
tip of the pipet is introduced to the bottom 
of the tube As filling proceeds the tip of 
the pipet is raised but it remains under the 
zLsmg blood memscus in order to as old 
foaming The level of the blood should be 
noted and the tubes capped to avoid evap- 
oration dunng the required centrifugation

Li is the height of the red cell column-in 
mm. and is the height of the whole 
blood specimen (red cells and plasma). 

The Micromethod. Equipment. A capil- 
lary hematocrit tube about 7 cm. long with 
a bore of about 1 mm. is recommended. 
The capillaries are filled with a 1 to 1000 
dilution of heparin, dried at S6“ C. or 
37® C. and stored. Special centrifuges are 
available producing centrifugal fields rang- 
ing from 5000 to 10,000 G. This permits 
shortening of centrifugation to five min- 
utes for the latter and ten minutes for the 
former. 

Collection of j/imfile. A warm but not 
congested skin site should be selected. The 
skin must be cleaned with an antiseptic and 
dried before the puncture. The skin punc- 
ture should be deep enough to permit free 
floiv of blood. The first two drops of blood 
should be wped away and the capillary 
filled by capillary attraction to within not 
less than 1 era. from the end. The empty 
end is sealed in a small flame of a micro- 
burner or plugged with modeling clay, e.g., 
plasticine. The filled tubes arc placed in 
the radial grooves of the microhematocrit 
centrifuge head ^vith the sealed end away 
from the center. 

The air at the outermost end of the 
capillary tviU be displaced in the course of 
centrifugation and the air gap will disap- 
pear. Leakage, especially if model clay was 
used for sealing, can be prevented by using 
a rubber gasket-at the periphery of the he- 
matocrit head to act as a cushion. Breakage 
of the delicate capillary can be prevented 
by spinning the centrifuge head first by 
hand, thus estabhshing contact between the 
end of the tube and the periphery of the 
head before turning on the motor. 

The capillary tubes are not graduated. 
The length of the whole column, including 
the plasma, and of the red cell column 
alone must be measured in each case with 
a millimeter rule and a magnifying lens or 
with one of several commercially available 
automatic or semiautomatic devices. The 
instructions of the manufacturer must be 
followed. 

Interpretation of results. The normal 
hematocrit for males is 47.0 ±: 7, for fe- 
males 42.0 ± 5. It is especially important 
for the diagnosis of anemia and poly- 
cythemia. It does not indicate the total red 
cell mass. The hematocrit is low in hy- 
dremia of pregnancy but the total number 
of circulating red cells is not reduced. The 
hematocrit may be normal or even high in 


Bloou 93 

shock accompanied by hemoconcentration 
but the total red cell mass may be consid- 
erably decreased due to blood loss. 

SoiirrM of error. Centrifugation. Ade- 
quate centrifugation both as to speed and 
duration is the sine qua non of a correct 
hematocrit. The red cells must he packed 
so that additional centrifugation does not 
reduce further the packed cell volume. In 
general, the higher the hematocrit, the more 
powerful the centrifugal force required. The 
centrifugal force means the magnitude and 
duration of the centrifugal field. It is ex- 
pressed in units of G., the acceleration due 
to gravity, and is calculated from the 
formula; 

CG = (1.118 X 10'*) n'^r, where C is the 
numerical measure of the field, n is the 
speed of rotation of the centrifuge (revolu- 
tions per minute), and r is the radius of 
rotation measured to the tip of the cen- 
trifuge cup. 

In the course of centrifugation, leuko- 
cytes, platelets, and plasma are trapped 
between the red cells, The error resulting 
from the former Is as a rule quite insig- 
nificant. The increment of the hematoent 
due to trapped plasma is somewhat greater 
than that due to leukocytes and platelets, 
but this too is of httle practical conse- 
quence. It was calculated to be in the range 
of 0 to 2 per cent in the hematocrit range 
of 33 to 68 per cent. 

The SAAtFtE. Prolonged stasis caused 
by constriction with a tourniquet may result 
in pronounced changes in hydrostatic pres- 
sure in capillaries. This source of error 
should be avoided. 

A free flow of blood from a skin puncture 
for microhematocrit is essential. The he- 
matocrit is unreliable immediately after a 
loss of blood, even if moderate, and imme- 
diately following transfusions. 

Red Cell Corpuscular Values 

Quantitative studies of corpuscular val- 
ues require accurate measumment of lie- 
matocrit, red cell count, and hemoglobin, 
the three basic tests for the study of red 
cdl disorders. 

The red cell count is less important as a 
screening procedure for the detection of 
anemia than is the determination of the 
hematocrit or the hemoglobin. It may be 
normal in some anemias, for example, in 
hypociiromic anemias. After the presence 
of anemia has been established, the red 
cell count is one of the three determinations

Volume of Ttlood ami Plasma 

Many methods hat e been devised for de- 
termining the total volume of blood The 
use of these in clinical medicine is limited 
by inherent inaccuracies and technical diffi 
culties The total blood volume amounts to 
about 7 7 per cent or 4 3 of the bod> 
weight 

There are ttvo basic indirect methods 
First, one may inject intrai enously a sub 
stance that becomes diluted in plasma and 
enables measurement of total plasma 
volume Hematocrit permits calculation of 
total blood volume Second one may inject 
intravenously a substance that is incorpor 
ated in the erythrocytes and permits mens 
urement of the red cell mass nnd total blood 
volume Plasma volume is the difference 
faetNveen the two or it can be calculated 
from either one using the hematocrit 
For a method to be reliable the following 
condition should be fulfilled by a suitable 
substance It should be retamed only in the 
plasma or in the cells without passing from 
one to the other or into the extravascular 
compartment Evans blue (Warner Chilcott 
T 1824) and tagged albumin both pass 
readily into the extravascular compartment 
This tendency is further incrensed in pa 
tients tilth edema In cases of impaired 
circulation the time needed for mixing with 
the blood is changed 

Difficulties Encountered When 
Isotopes Are Used for Erythrocyte 
Tagging 

They maj be eluted into plasma and 
measurement of total erythrocyte volume 
may be inaccurate They may be adsorbed to 
glass surface with a loss up to 10 to 20 
per cent this results in underestimation of 
plasma volume Erythrocyte measurement 
IS based on the assumption that erythrocytes 
are umformly distributed in the vascular 
system This is not the case in circulatory 
disturbances and in splenomegaly 

Other Sources oi Error These include 
the need for using the hematocrit and for 
considering its inherent errors for calcula 
tion of total blood volume or total erythro 
cyte mass The trapping of plasma in cen 
trifugation must also be considered Finally

Evans Blue Dye Method for Determin 
INC THE Volume of Blood and Plasma 

The blood volume is determined under 
basal conditions The patient reports to the 
laboratory in the moniing having fasted 
since the evening meal of the previous day 
He IS asked to he down quietly for at least 
20 minutes before the dye js injected All 
matenals should be at hand so that the 
procedure will move smoothly and in proper 
time sequence All syringes and needles 
must be absolutely dry every precaution is 
taken to avoid hemolysis A tourniquet is 
not used during the withdrawal of blood

formula 

Plasma volume = X F 

The constant “K" is the same for each 
lot of dye It is determined In (he foUowuig 
manner Dilute 1 ml of dye solution to 50 
ml with water in a volumetric flask (There 
IS enough dye remaimng in each vial for 
this step after the 10 ml have been with 
drawn for the test ) Deliver 5 ml of the 
diluted d>e into a 50 ml volumetric flask

cedure that is used It is necessary for each 
laboratory group to estabhsh its normal 
hmits and to become acquamted with the 
expected vanations in isease Measure 
ments are not hkely to be vabd unless the 
procedure is m more or less constant use 
and is done by techmcians who have had 
considerable experience with the method 
Using the technique outlmed here the 
plasma volume for men is approximately 
40 to 48 ml per kilogram of body weight 
and for women 37 to 46 ml per kg Total 
blood volume in normal adult men is ap 
proximately 70 to 85 ml per kg and for 
women 59 to 73 ml per kg Some workers 
prefer to express the blood and plasma 
volumes in relation to body surface rather 
than body weight In our experience no 
method of expression will avoid certain 
inconsistencies that appear when we at 
tempt to compare results obtained in dif 
ferent patients under what would seem to 
be idenucal physiologic or chnical condi 
tions 

The blood volume with T 3824 is higher 
than with labeled erythrocytes Blood 
volume data are usually related to body 
weight Differences for persons of the same 
weight are due to varying amounts of fat 
and lean ussues Lower blood volume in 
women may be partly due to tbeir greater 
fat content Total blood volume at birth is 
about 300 ml Differences m blood volume 
related to sex appear first at about 10 years 
of age 

Clinical Applications Surgical pauents 
with anerma and hemoconcentration may 
have a normal red cell count and hematoent 
Admmislration of fluid postoperauvely and 
transfusion therapy are best guided by tests 
lor total blood volume plasma volume ani 
red cell mass Patients may need packed 
red cells but not salme or plasma or vice 
versa patients may need only plasma and 
not whole blood Pnor to transfusion ther 
apy erythrocyte counts and hematocrits 
may be misleading Volume studies may 
help to decide if whole blood or only plasma 
is needed 

Frogi/Hy Tests 

Lryt/trocyle Osmoltc Tragiltly Test 

•destruction of erythrocytes goes on con 
tmually vvithm the body In certain patho- 
logic conditions this destrucuon is greatly 
accelerated and may lead to anemia It is 
then of great practical interest to ascertain 
whether the excessive hemolysis is referable 



The 

chiefly to increased fragility of the erjlhro 
cytes as is typically the case in hereditary 
spherocytosis (congenital hemolytic anc 
mia) The resistance of the erythrocytes cm 
be measured by subjecting them to the 
action of vanous harmful agents In clinical 
work hypotomc salt solution is generally 
used 

Principle Red cells suspended m hypo 
^mc soluhon of sodium chlori de take up 
water sivell become spheroidal and more 
fragile and eventually burst The increased 
fragility which leads to lysis is determined 
by two mam factors It is inversely proper 
tionate to the concentration of sodium 
chlonde and directly proportionate to the 
thickness of the erythrocyte The ceU that 
IS closest to being round or spherical (t^ie 
spherocyte of hereditary spherocytosis) has 
the smallest volume for its contents and its 
capacity to expand is hmited Consequently 
It bursts upon intake of small amounts of 
water in relatively high concentrations of 
the salt Its osmotic fragility is increased 
and Its osmotic resistance is decreased On 
the other band the thin or flat cell in 
hypochromic anemia can take up consider 
able amounts of water and requires lower 
concentrations of sodium chloride to lyse 
Its osmotic fragility decreased its resist 
ance is increased ^ 

The osmotic fragility test measures ac 
curately how nearly spherical red cells arc 
but It does not measure the fragility of the 
red cells I ncreased osmotic fraplity or de- 
creased res istance means spheroc ytosis The 
degrt'c Of the latter^araiiels fairly ac 
curately the degree of the former The 
accuracy of the parallelism depends on the 
accuracy of the method employed for meas 
unng the fragility 

Increased fragility is found in hereditary 
spherocytosis and in Idiopathic and symp 
tomatic acquired hemolytic anemias Con 
tranwise diminished osmotic fragility or 
increased resistance means exccssne fiat 
ness of red cells It is seen in the pirsence 
of jaundice m iron deficiency anemias in 
thalassemia in sickle cell anemia in poly 
cjthemia \era in diseases of the liver after 
splenectomy and in a \ariety of anemias 
in ivlilch tirget cells are found In thalas 
semia a portion of red cells may remain 
undissolied in 0 03 per cent saline and e»cn 
in distilled water In tests for osmotic 
fragility identical amounts of blood are 
added to decreasing concentrations of so 
dium chlonde solution After a period of 
incubation the highest concentration of 


Blood <17 

sodium chloride with minimum hcmoljsis 
determmes beginning hemoljsis the high 
est concentration in which hemolasls Is 
complete expresses the complete hemoljsis 
Incipient hemoljsis in higher concentra 
tions of sodium chlonde is an indicator of 
increased osmouc fragility of red colls In 
other words osmotic fra^lity of red cells 
is increased if hemolysis occurs in over 0 5 
pet cent concentrauon of sodium chlonde 
On the other hand osmotic fragilicj is 
decreased if hemolysis Is incomplete m 0 3 
per cent sodium chloride 

Two tests of osmotic fragilitj of varying 
degrees of accuracy will be described

1 Stock solution of sodium chloride 
A 1 per cent solution of sodium chloride is 
prepared by dissolving 1 0 gm of C P so- 
dium chlonde in 100 ml of distilled water 
The salt must be first dried in a desiccator 

2 Dilute solutions The 0 85 per cent 
solution is prepared by placing 8 5 ml of 
the stock solution in a test tube and adding 
1 5 ml of distilled water Similarly the 0 50 
per cent solution is prepared by Tr)i\ing 5 0 
ml amounts of the stock solution and of 
distilled water 

Procedure One miUihtcr of each of the 
two solutions IS placed in one of the two 
tubes One tenth milliliter of oxalaied ve 
nous blood is added To a similar set of 
two tubes blood of a normil person Is added 
and serves as a control The control blood 
must be obtained approximately at the same 
time as the patients The tubes arc shaken 
gently and if the tube wah the 0 5 per cent 
sodium chlonde ';olutJon shows hemolysis 
and the one with 0 85 per cent is not 
hcmolyzcd the osmotic fragiJitj of the red 
cells is probably increased and a quantita

various so-called connective tissue diseases 
^^uch as rheumatic fever and rheumatoid 
^arthnus and in locahzed acute inflamma 
tion in which the rate appears to increase 
with the leukoc>te count 

The cause of the phenomenon is not 
clear Sedimentation is the result of greater 
densit> of erythrocytes than of plasma 
Many hypotheses have been suggested to 
explain the mechanism According to one 
of thehi -changes in the negative electric 
charge of the surface of red cells and of the 
positive electric charge of the plasma are 
responsible 

Vanous factors have been demonstrated 
to play a role 

Plasma Factors An accelerated E S R 
(erythroc)te sedimentation rate) is^avored 
b^ elevated levels of ^nnogen and to a 
lesser extent of globulin These plasma com 
pbnents cause '^increased formation of 
rouleaux which are sedimenung more 
rapidly because of their increased weight 
as compared with single cells Removal of 
fibrinogen by defibrination lowers the E S R 
except when plasma globulin is markedly 
elevated 

The effect of globulin on acceleration of 
the E S R 18 less pronounced than that of 
fibrinogen except in liver disease in which 
close correlation between the two has been 
noted m the presence of low fibrinogen 
levels That 'fibrinogen and globulin are 
not the onl> responsible factors is shown 
by the fact that E S R may be accelerated 
in the presence of normal levels and in pa 
tients without anemia There is no absolute 
correlation between the ESR ond any of 
the plasma protein fractions Alpha and 
beta globubns are more effective than 
gamma globulin Albumin retards sedimen 
tation 

Extreme increase in plasma vascosity 
slows down the ESR by counteracting the 
accelerating effect of blood proteins on 
rouleaux formation (Eastham J954) Cho- 
lesterol accelerates and lecithin retards the 
E.SR 

J RctI Ceil Factors Anemia is responsible 
for accelerated ESR The change in the 
erythrocyte plasma ratio favors rouleaux 
formation (Poole 1952) 

Microcytes sediment significantly more 
slowly and macrocytes somewhat more 
rapidly than normocytes Tlie larger the 
ceDs the smaller the surface in relation to 
the volume The sedimentation rate is di 
rectly proportionate to the

cell aggregate and Inversely proportionate 
to the surface area) Rouleaux formation Is 
an aggregation of erythrocytes into units of 
larger size and proportionately decreased 
surface area which is smaller In relation to 
the volume of the aggregate than the com 
bmed surface area of the individual cells 
The result is acceleration of the E S R 
Vnticoagulants Sodium citrate does not 
affect the rale of sedimentation but o\ 
alates and hepann may 
Stages in the ESR Three stages can be 
observed ( 1 ) The initial period of aggrega 
tion During this phase the rouleaux are 
formed and the sedunentatlon is relatively 
slow It lasts about ten minutes of the one 
hour observation penod (2) The penod of 
fast settling During this penod the set 
thng rate is constant It lasts about 40 min 
utes (3) The final period of packing con 
tinues for the balance of the hour and 
for a longer time afterwards 

/Kiethods for Determining the 
Sedimentation Rate 
Smee a vanety of methods have been 
used in determining the sedimentation rate 
the figures of different workers who use 
different methods are not comparable 
The p S R may be measured in one of 
two ways one measures the time it takes 
for the upper level of the red cell column 
to reach a specified point (Unzenmejer 
method) and the other measures the dis 
tance covered by the upper level in a spcci 
fied penod of time (Westergren method) 
The latter is more practical and more widely 
accepted The specified penods of time maj 
be one hour (the most popular procedure) 
or 15 minutes (Cutler method) or the 
ESR per minute Is calculated The latter 
the Rourkc Emstene method gives probably 
the most reliable results but is the least 
practical method for routine work The 
height of the column of blood is an im 
portant factor as Is also the size of the 
borc of the sedimentation tube 

The more important differences In mcih 
ods can be reduced to the composition of 
the inticoagulant the length of the lube 
and its diameter the volume of blood used 
the time of observation and the reading 
and recording of results

on one side from 0 to 10 cm. and on the 
other from 10 to 0. 

Reagent. A mixture of dried ammo- 
nium and potassium oxalate (6 mg. of the 
former and 4 mg. of the latter for each 5 
ml. of blood) Is used. The tubes in which 
the blood is collected can be prepared in 
advance by placing in them the oxalate 
solution and then evaporating to dryness 
in a hot air oven. 

Technique 

1. Five milllUlers of venous blood are 
'withdra^vn in a dry syringe, placed in a 
tube or bottle containing the anticoagulant, 
and mixed well. 

2. With a caplUar)’ hematocrit pJpet, 
a Wintrobe tube is filled with blood to the 
10 cm. mark. This is done by passing a 
hematocrit pipet to the bottom of the tube. 
As the blood is expelled gradually, the pipet 
is raised. This helps to avoid producing air 
bubbles in the tube. 

3. The filled tube Is placed in an ex- 


actly vertical position in an appropriate rack 
and left at room temperature. 

4. The point on the millimeter scale 
to which the erythrocytes have fallen is the 
E.S.K. Readings at 15-minute inter\’als may 
give some indication of the rate of sedi- 
mentation. 

5. The tube is centrifuged until pack- 
ing of erythrocytes is complete, usually at 
2500 G for 30 minutes. The volume of 
packed erythrocytes is read on the scale 
and recorded as the hematocrit. 

Various methods have been suggested to 
correct j fpr^ anem ia, but the present con- 
sensus is not to do it, because all methods 
of correction are crude and frequently more 
misleading than helpful. Recording the he- 
matocrit calls attention to the presence and 
degree of anemia or polycythemia, and this 
permits proper interpretation of the result 
of E.S.R;^he normal average sedimenta- 
tion in one hour as determined by this 
method is 4 mm. for healthy men and 10 
mm. for women, with a maximal range 
,./from 0 to 9 mm. for men and 0 to 20 mm. 
for women. The norma) figures given here 
are not to be correlated with those which 
have been obtained with other methods. 
'^Vesiergrcn’s Method. Because of its sim- 
plicity the Westergren method Is widely 
used. 

Equipment. The Westergren tube is a 
straight pipet 30 cm. long and 2.5 mm. in 
internal diameter. It is calibrated in milli- 
meters from 0 to 200. It holds about 1 ml 
The Westergren rack is also used (Fig. 4-20).

A Exactly 0 5 ml of the 3 8 per cent 
solution of sodium citrate is transferred 
with a graduated pipet to a tube with a 
mark at the 5 ml level 

Jl Five milliliters of venous blood are 
withdrawn in a dry syringe and 4 5 fhl of 
It IS placed in the tube containing the anti 
coagulant The tube now filled to the 5 
ml mark is inverted two or three times to 
mix thoroughly the anticoagulant with the 
blood 

3 A Westergren pipet is filled exactly 
to the 0 mark and placed in the rack TTie 
bottom of the tube must be pressed firmly 
against the rubber stopper in the base of 
the rack before removnng the finger from 
the top of the tube The tube must be held 
firmly by the clip at the top of the rack in 
an exactly vertical position The rack is con 
structed to hold 12 or more tubes 

4 The level of the red cells is read in 
millimeters m exactly 60 minutes 

With this method the normal sedimenta

value of such corrections Occasionally para

anemia (Fig 4-21) '• 

Sources of Error 

1 The anticoagulant The exact concen 
tration is important If it is higher than 
recommended the ESR may be slowed 
down 

2 Hemolysis may modify the sedimenta 
tion

height should be not less than 100 mm 
The optimum inner diameter is 2 5 to 3 75

must be removed 

5 Effect of the acceleration by tihmg 
The red cells aggregate along the lower side 
while the plasma rises along the upper side 
Consequently, the retarding inHuencc of the 
nsing plasma is less effective An angle 
of even 3® from the vertical may accelerate 
the ESR by as much as 30 per cent

9 Anemia A decrease in the number of 
erythrocytes accelerates the E S R an in

was the reason for the attempts to make a 
correction for the anemia but as stated 
elsewhere m this chapter the present tend 
ency is to recognize that the value of the 
E S R IS extremely hmited in the presence 
of anemia and that a correction for the 
anemia is hardly worth the effort and may 
be actually imsleadmg

y/l NTERPRETATION 

Many aspects of the E S R have not 
been settled The rate has been shown to 
be higher in females . than m males but it 
has not been settled whether this difference 
appbes to the upper limit of normal The 
same holds regarding the alleged higher 
rate in the aged . It may be that in both 
instances the l ower normal red celf volume 
is responsible 

According to the current interpretation 
the accelerated E S R is a noj^pecific-re- 
sponse to tissue damag^lt is only an indi

THE LEUKOCYTES 
^The JVftite Cell Count 

Equipment The white cell pipet has a 
stem and a mixing chamber (Fig 4-7) 
The stem is divided mto ten parts which 
measure the volume of the blood sample 
The fifth and tenth graduations are marked 
as 0 5 and 10 respectively The mixing 
chamber extends from the mark 1 0 to 11 0 
it contains a white bead which aids in the 
mixing The volume of the mixing chambe 
IS 20 times the volume of the stem at the 
mark 0 5 and 10 times the volume at the 
mark 1 0 YVhen blood is drawn to the 0 5 
mark (1 volume) and the diluting fluid to 
the 11 0 mark (11 volumes) the dilution 
of the blood sample is 1 to 20 and the 
dilution factor is 20 When blood is drawn 
to the 1 0 mark and the diluting factor to 
11 0 the dilution factor is 10 

The counting chamber with the improved 
Neubauer rubng is used The ruled area 
measures 9 $q mm The central square Is 
used for counting the erythrocytes and the 
four squares at the comers each measuring 

I sq Jnm are used for counting the leu 
kocytes 

Diluiing rittid The diluting fluid should 
dissolve the erythrocytes so that they will 
not obscure the leukocytes The simplest 
diluting fluid IS a 2 per cent solution of 
acetic acid More satisfactory Is the fol 
lowing 

^Glacial acetic acid 2 ml 

1 per cent aqieous solution 
of gentian violet ✓ 1 ml 

Distilled water 100 ml 

The fluid must be filtered frequently to 
remove yeasts and molds 

Technique All recommendations made 
previously relating to the erythrocytes apply 
also to leukocytes and will not be repented 
here 

1 The blood is drawn carefully to the 
0 5 mark and the diluting fluid to the mark 

II This gives a dilution of 1 to 20 If the 
b'ood should accidentally go much above 
the 0 5 mark it is drawn to 0 6 and the 
final count is multipbed by

Clinical Diagnosis 

2 The outside of the tip of the pipet is 
wiped off with cotton to remove any blood 
that may be adhering to jt making sure 
that the level of the blood m the lumen of 
the pipet was not affected 

3 The dilutmg fluid is drawn to fill the 
mixing chamber to the mark 11 

4 The pipet is held between the thumb 
and the middle finger and the contents are 
mixed well by shaking the pipet for three 
minutes m all directions except in the long 
axis of the pipet Pipet rotors save time and 
labor and do a good mixing job 

5 The first three drops are blown out to 
discard the diluting fluid from the stem 
which contains no blood 

6 The counting chamber is loaded ex 
actly the same way as was described for 
the erythrocyte count Loading both count 
mg chambers and counting the leukocytes 
in eight instead of four squares gives more 
reliable results 

7 The chamber is placed on the micro 
scope and the light is adjusted to make the 
leukocytes stand out clearly when viewed 
with a low power objective The four comer 
squares are surveyed to check the distnbu 
tion of the leukocytes Uneven distnbution 
is caused by inadequate or improper mixing 
of the pipet or failure to discard enough of 
the dflutmg fluid In the pipet stem If that 
happens the counting chamber and the 
coverglass have to be washed and wiped 
dry the mixing repeated and the chamber 
reloaded 

8 The leukocytes are counted with a 16 
or 8 mm objective and a 10 X ocular A 
square milhmeter will be mcluded m the 
field of the 16 mm objecuve The leuko- 
cytes are counted m each of the secondary 
squares of the four large comer squares 
beginmng at the extreme left of the top 
row moving right then down to the second 
row then left through the four secondary 
squares of the second row then down to 
the third row then right along the third 
row and finally down to the fourth row and 
from right to left along the fourth row 
until all the leukocytes m the 16 secondary 
squares have been counted Only the cells 
that touch the dividing lines to the left 
and above are included those touchmg the 
dmdmg hues to the right and below are 
omitted (Fig 4-22) 

The leukocytes found in all 16 small 
squares are added This gives the number 
in 1 sq mm The numbers counted in all 
four comer squares of each chamber are 
added If only one chamber is counted the 



total IS divided by four to find the average 
per square milhmeter The average is mul 
tjphed by 10 to find the number m 1 cu 
mm of diluted blood and by the diluUon to 
find the number in a cubic milhmeter of 
undiluted blood With a Neubauer or sum 
lar ruhng and a dilutio n of 1 to 20^.a con 
vement plan is the following Wi^ a low 
power objective the leukocytes in the 
square millimeters at each of the four cor 
ners of the ruled area are counted and 
irultjphed by 50 or the coun^-'is divided 
by two and two zeros are added This should 
be repeated on a second shde and the aver 
age taken A general formula is 

... „ cc X d X 10 

Number celJs per cu mm : 

^ Isc 

where cc is the total number of cells counted 
d IS the dilution factor 10 is the factor 
transforming the surface of the square md 
limeter to the volume m cubic millimeters 
and Isc = the number of large squares 
counted 

In leukopenia with a total count below 
2500 the blood is drawn to the I 0 mark and 


the dilution factor is 10 

Example 120 cells counted in eight 
squares Number of leukocytes per cu mm 
= X 10 X 10 ^ 

In leukocytosis with high counts red 
cell pipets are used and the dilution may 
be 1 to 100 or even 1 to 200 

Sources of Error The dilution factor in 
white cell counts is smaller than in the red 
cell count This influences the inherent 


error With good technique when four large 
squares in each of 2 chambers are counted 
the error for a count within normal limits 



The Blood 


Is ±15 per cent When only four squares 
are counted the error increases to ±20 
per cent 

If 100 cells are counted the standard 
deviation is about — 10 Accord 

mgly if 100 cells are counted 95 per cent 
of observed white cell counts of true value 
of 8000 cells per cu mm would lie wthin 
the range of 6400 to 9600 The error m the 
leukocyte count is less important than in 
the red cell counts The difference between 
8000 and 6400 is of little practical conse- 
quence 

In general the error decreases as the total 
leukocyte count and the number of cells 
included in the count increase As many 
leukocytes as possible should be counted 

Impurities and dehns in the diluting fluid 
are other possible sources of error They 
can be prevented by filtering the diluting 
fluid frequently Occasionally leukocytes 
tend to clump especially when oxalated or 
heparinized blood is left standing for sev 
er^ hours before samples are withdrawn 
for counting 

Nucleated red cells will be counted and 
cannot be distinguished from leukocytes 
with the magnification used If their num 
ber IS high as seen on the stained smear 
a correction should be made according to 
the following formula 

No of NRBC* . . , 
r oo - No ' of N RB-C- 
No of nucleated red cells per cu nun 

Corrected count - leukocyte count per cu 
mm — nucleated red cell count per cu mm 

Example The blood smear shows 25 
nucleated red cells per 100 leukocytes The 
total white cell count is 10 000 

~ X 10 000 = 2500 

10 000 - 2500 - 7500 per cu mm 

The true leukocyte count is 7S00 per cu mm 

THE PLATELETS 

The number of platelets in the platelet 
count depends on the method of counting 
With the Rees Ecker method the normal 
range is 140 000 to 340 000 per cubic miJli 
meter of blood Indirect methods yield 
higher values With Damesheks method the 
normal range is 500 000 to 900 000 

• Number of nucleated red cells as counted in the 
differential count per 100 leukocytes 


IOj 

Tunction Small insignificant and frag 
lie as the platelet is it is known to ha\e 
several functions and chances are that more 
will be discovered These functions are of 
two kinds First they take part in blood 
coagulation by being a source of platelet 
factor 3 and of other factors involved in 
coagulation They are essential for clot re 
traction They participate in mamtaimng 
the mtegnty of the blood vessel wall by 
becoming agglutinated and sealing defects 
m the wall Second they are carriers of 
serotonin (5 hydroxytryptamine) 

The platelets originate in the marrow 
from megakaryocytes In general whenever 
the number of thrombocytes is less than tlie 
critical levels of 100 000 to 50 000 per cubic 
millimeter of blood a hemorrhagic tendency 
may become evident Its severity is usually 
inversely^roportionate to the number of 
platelets ‘Prolonged bleeding time aelayed 
and inadequate clot retraction ^mnmshed 
prothrombm consumption positive tour 
niquet test and pelecbiae may be the other 
associated in tatro and in vivo findings 

Appearance 

Platelets are round oval or rod shaped 
2 to 4 u m diameter and are cipable of 
ameboid movement by means of pseudo 
podia as evidenced by the presence of 
elongated platelets in stained blood smears 
Considerably larger platelets can be seen 
when blood is regenerating rapidly and 
actively In Wngbt stained smears the con 
ter (the granulomere) about one third to 
one half of the platelet is filled with fine 
purplish red granules 0 03 to 0 06 ^ in 
size It is surrounded by the homogeneous 
or finely fibrillar pale blue cytoplasm (the 
hyalomere) The separation into a "granu 
lomere" and “hyalomere” may be artefacts 
because upon prompt fixation and staining 
with brilliant cresyl blue the two zones are 
not demonstrable The phtelet contains no 
nuclear material and no or almost no de 
oxyTibonucIejc acid 

Physiologic variations in number of 
thrombocytes are considerable The new 
born especially during the first two di>s 
of life have fewer platelets (150 000 to 
250 000) than older Infants The number 
of platelets decreases progressively before 
menstruation even more precipitously dur 
ing the first day of menstruation They 
begm to nse on the third day Violent ex 
crclse IS followed by a nse possibly caused 
bj a change in distribution The number 
increases as one ascends to a higher altl 



Clinical Diagnosis b\ 

tude and is higher m %Mnter than in sum 
mer There are unexplained \ anaiions frdm 
day to da> hence a single abnormal count 
should not be taken to indicate a pathologic 
condition 

The number of the platelets is the result 
of an equilibrium betiieen their production 
m the marrow and their utilization loss or 
destruction in the penpheral blood The 
normal life span of platelets has been gen 
erally estimated to be about four days but 
in a recent report the use of a radioactiie 
label showed a survi\al of eight to nine 
dajs On the basis of a four-day suiNi^al 
period and an average 4Q0 QQO platelets pet 
cu mm 100 000 platelets are formed and 
destroyed per cu mm per da> In disease 
vanations are often extremely great An 
increase (thrombocythemia) ma^ be due to 
an increase m the number or m the activ 
ity of the megakaryocytes The result may 
be a tendenc> to thrombosis or rarely and 
paradoxically to hemorrhage The latter is 
explained by the fact that extremely high 
platelet counts have an anticoagulant effect 
and ma) inhibit the generation of thrombo' 
plastm A decrease (thrombocytopenia) is 
more important There is no means of recog 
mzmg increased destruction of thrombi 
cytes as Acre is in the case of erythrocytes 
(see reticulocyiosis) Even when thrombo- 
cytes are present in normal numbers they 
maj be functionallj defective 

Clinical Appucations 

On the clmical side the foUmving facts 
seem to be established 

1 In acute infectious diseases the num 
ber of platelets is usually normal or sub 
normal occasional!) it may be increased 

2 In secondary anemia espeaally in the 
posthemorrhagic type the count generall) 
IS increased although it sometimes is de 
creased In permaous anemia it nearly 
alwajs IS greatly diminished and an m 
crease should cause one to question the 
diagnosis of this condition 

3 It IS increased-m. polyc)thenua and

6 Platelet counts are of great value in 
disUnguishing the hemorrhagic diseases In 
hemophilia the platelets are normal m num 
ber but are claimed to be defecuve in 
function The clot although delayed is well 
formed and has normal retractile power In 
thrombocytopemc purpura on the other 
hand platelets are functionally normal but 
greatly reduced in number The count 
ranges from about 40 000 to 75 000 per 
cubic millimeter m cases of mild purpura 
to IS 000 or less in cases in which the

The Platelet Count 

Platelets are difficult to count because 
they distintegrate easily and rapidly and 
then are hard to disunguisb from debns 
Another source of difficulty is their tendency 
to adhere to glass to any foreign body and 
particularly to each other In addition there 
IS evidence that they are not evenlv dis 
tnbuted m the blood The unavoidable error 
IS greater than in counting erythrocytes or 
leukocytes but is neghgible in practice be- 
cause only great vanations in the count 
have chmcal significance It is often pos 
sible to recogmze a great decrease in the 
number of platelets by a careful inspection 
of stained films provided these are made 
evenly and very quickly after the blood was 
obtamed in order to avoid clumping There 
fore a remark regarding platelets should 
be a part of the report on the differential 
count in the form of a reference to their ab- 
normal shape and inadequacy in numbers 
if noted 

Many methods have been proposed for 
counting platelets but there are two groups 
of them In the direct methods the platelets 
are counted simil arly as the red and white 
cells In the mdirect methods the platelets 
and the red cells are counted simultaneously 
and then the number of platelets per cubic 
millimeter is calculated on the basis of the 
red cell count 



Tut. Blood 


E.ich method has its merits and disad- 
vantages. The direct methods give more 
accurate results in the hands of the ex- 
perienced and meticulous worker. Tlie in- 
direct methods are somewhat easier for Uic 
less e.vperienced who docs platelet counts 
only occasionally. In the direct methods, the 
results arc regularly lower than those ob- 
tained by some of the indirect methods. 

Direct Meil)o<ls. Pri»rif)Ie^ Capillary or 
venous blood with an anticoagulant is 
mixed in a red ccU pipet with a diluting 
fluid. The platelets are counted in a hemo- 
cytomctcr. 

Mrlhod of Rees anti Ccker (1923). 
Diluting Fluid. This solution preser\'os the 
erythrocytes, which may be counted in the 
same specimen. 

Sodium citrate 3 8 gm. 

FormaIdeIi>dc, 40 per cent 
solution 0 2 ml. 

Brilliant cresyl blue 0.03 gm. 

Water 100 ml. 

The formula Is a slight modification of 
the original. The reduced amount of the 
dye is adequate. The solution Is made by 
adding 3.8 gm. of sodium citrate to 75 ml. 
of distilled water. Brilliant cresyl blue is 
ground In a mortar with three or four sam- 
ples of distilled nater of S ml. each. It is 
then filtered and ml-xcd with the solution 
of sodium citrate. Tlie formaldehyde Is 
added and the ^ol^me brought up with dis- 
tilled water to 100 ml. The mi.vturc Is al- 
lowed to stand at room temperature with 
occasional shaking. It is then filtered and 
centrifuged at 2500 G. for 30 minutes 
to remove any undlssolvcd particles. The 
supernatant Is kept in glass stoppered bot- 
tles in the refrigerator. The fluid is iTftered 
each time before use and the unused portion 
Is discarded. 

Te chniqu e. The pipet, counting cham- 
ber. and aii other glasstvare must be com- 
pletely free of grease and debris. Rapid 
work is necessary in order to prevent clump- 
ing of the platelets. The skin is cleansed 
with soap and water, followed by alcohol 
and ether or acetone. The finger is better 
than the ear lobe, because hyperemia and 
free flow of blood can be prc3diiced easily 
by immersion in warm water. 

Venous blood gives more reproducible 
counts. It is best collected in a siliconed 
test lube. A direct, uncomplicated venipunc- 
ture and minimal contamination with tis- 
sue juice is essential. 

The diluting fluid is drawn to near the 
1 mark in the “red” pipet and then expelled.

and blood from a freely bleeding skin punc- 
ture or from a bottle containing freshly 
obtained and adequately shaken venous 
blood is drawn exactly to the 0.5 mark. The 
excessive blood is rapidly wiped off the out- 
side of the tip, and finally the diluting 
fluid is quickly drawn to the 1 01 mark. This 
gives a blood dilution of 1 to 200. The 
blood and diluting fluid are immediately 
mixed by shaking for three to five minutes 
and the first several drops are discarded. 
The counting chamber is filled at once, and 
15 minutes are allowed for the corpuscles 
to settle before counting is begun. To pre- 
vent drying, the hemacytometer must be 
covered with a Petri dish containing moist- 
ened filter paper. The count is made with 
the liigh power, dry objective and with the 
10 X ocular in the manner described for 
counting erythrocytes. In the counting 
chamber the platelets appear as highly re- 
fractile, round, oval, or elongated particles, 
I to S ^ in size. With the Rees-Ecker dilut- 
ing fluid the red cells are preserted. Proper 
adjustment of the light is important to dis- 
tinguish the platelets from debris, yeast 
cells, or precipitated stain. If too many ex- 
traneous particles axe present, repeating the 
count with a new sample of blood and with 
rcflltcrcd diluting fluid may be necessary, 
e.speciafly if loading the chamber with di- 
luting fluid alone corroborates the suspicion. 

An occasional small clump of platelets 
does not interfere, but if they are too many 
or too large, the count is valueless. The 
diluting fluid or the technique may be at 
fault, especially slow work. If the red cells 
have been hemolyzed, the diluting fluid is 
at fault. 

ft fs best to count the platelets in two 
large corner squares in each of two counting 
chambers, or a total of four squares. The 
average number of platelets per 0.1 cu. 
mm. (lai^ square) is multiplied by 10 to 
get the number present in 1.0 cu. mm. and 
by 200 to correct for the dilution or by a 
factor 2000. The result is the number of 
platelets per 1 cu. mm. A control count 
should always be made at the same time 
with blood from a normal person, using 
the same diluting fluid and exactly the 
same technique. 

Sources of Error in the Direct 
Methods. They are the same as those in- 
herent in the red and white cell count. Some 
of the special sources of error are particles 
that may be confused %vith platelets- Tins 
can be controlled by a “blank” count on the 
diluting fluid. If it is below 5000. a cor-

platelet like particles a fresh clean dilut 
mg IS needed The error is proportionally 
greater as the count decreases Doubling the 
amount of blood or using a white cell pipet 
in which the dilution factor is decreased 
are other ways of reducing the error Sili 
coned glassware, pipets and needles ha\e 
also been recommended Clean glassware 
and sterilized diluting fluid stored in glass 
stoppered bottles in a refngerator and fil 
tered each time before use contribute to 
the accuracj of the count If hemolysis of 
red cells is noted the fluid should be dis

additional advantage is that reticulocytes 
can also be counted. 

Accuracy of the Platelet CotrNx 
Differences of less than 25 per cent axe 
not significant. Expressed another way, a 
difference of at least 80,000 between two 
successiv'e counts on the same person may 
be significant. Some of the factors deter- 
mining accuracy are experience, meticulous 
attention to detail, and the number of 
platelets counted. The high counts are not 
necessarily correct. Venous blood diluted as 
soon as it is obtained gives more repro- 
ducible results. 


EXAMINATION OF STAINED BLOOD 
iMaking and Staining Blood Films 

The information gathered from the ex- 
amination of the blood smear is extremely 
Important. It may furnish the diagnosis as 
does a histologic section. It may serve as a 
guide to therapy and as indicator of harmful 
effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
The reliability of the Information obtained 
depends to a considerable extent on the 
quality of the smears. Properly spread films 
are essential to accurate work. They more 
than compensate for the time spent in learn- 
ing to make them. 

There are certain requisites for success 
with any method; First, the slides and 
coverglasses must be -perfectly clean and 
free of grease. They should be washed ivlth 
soap and water, then with abundant, clean 
hot water (the water should not be per- 
mitted to cool before all the soap has been 
removed), followed by distilled water, and 
then dried and polished ivith a clean, lint- 
free cloth. From then on they must be 
handled by touching only their edges. 
Washed slides and coverglasses may be 
stored in 95 per cent alcohol. Dry cover- 
glasses may also be stored in a clean, dry 
Petri dish. 

Large numbers of slides and coverglasses 
may be cleaned in advance with acid clean- 
ing solution, which is prepared as follows: 
Twenty-five grams of potvdered potassium 
• dichromate is dissolved in a Pyrex beaker in 
' 25 ml. of water with the aid of heat. Let 
it cool and add slowly 1 L. of technical 
i grade concentrated sulfuric acid. This step 


Blood IOO 

must be done cautiously because intense 
heat develops. 

The slides and coverglasses are dropped 
individually into the cleaning solution and 
left in it for from 4 to 24 hours. The clean- 
ing solution is poured off and the slides 
washed \vith multiple changes of tap water. 
The removal of the acid may be accelerated 
by heating. The complete removal of the 
acid is established when the tap water is 
negative with litmus paper. They should 
then be rinsed in distilled water. TTie slides 
and coverslips are then stored as described 
previously. For routine use, clean shdes are 
available commercially. 

The drop of blood must not be too large 

The work must be done quickly, before 
coagulation begins. The blood is obtained 
from the finger tip or the lobe of the ear, 
as for a blood count. Only a very small drop 
is required, usually about twice the size of 
a pinhead. The size of the drop largely de- 
termines the thickness of the film. The 
proper thickness depends on the purpose 
for which the film is made. For a study of 
the structure of blood corpuscles and ex- 
amination for malarial parasites, it should 
be so thin that, throughout the greater part 
of the film, the erythrocytes lie In a single 
layer, close together but not overlapping. 
For routine differential counting of leuko- 
cytes, a film in which the erythrocytes are 
piled up somewhat is best because the 
leukocytes are more evenly distributed, the 
number of leukocytes in a given area is 
greatly increased, and the tedium of count- 
ing Is correspondingly lessened. The film 
must not. on the other hand, be so thick 
that identification of the various leukocytes 
becomes difficult. In some cases of severe 
anemia, it is very difficult to make good 
films owing to the large proportion of 
plasma, which leads to slow drying with 
consequent distortion of the erythrocytes 
and the appearance of artefacts. To over- 
come this, the films should be made very 
thin and dried quickly. 

The Two-slide Methoil. The coverglass 
method has the advantage of more even 
distribution of leukocytes. In ever>' other 
respect the slide method is preferable. Slides 
are easier to handle and to label and are 
less fragile. 

Preparation of the film. Take a small 
drop of blood on a chemically clean and 
dust-free slide about % inch from the end, 
using care that the slide does not touch 
the skin. Place the slide on a table or flat 
surface. At the bedside it may be more con-

\ement to hold the end of the slide away 
from the drop by the thumb and forefinger 
of the left hand and to support the other 
end wth the small finger With the thumb 
and forefinger of the nght hand hold the 
end of a second shde against the surface 
of the first at an angle of 30 to 40 degrees 
(the free edge of the spreader shde will 
then be about an inch above the table) and 
draw it up against the drop of blood until 
contact IS established The drop wiU imme 
diately run across the end filling the angle 
between the two shdes The edge of the 
spreader must be absolutely smooth If it 
IS rough the film has ragged tails contain 
ing many leukocytes A “margin free” blood 
spreader prepared by cuttmg off the comers 
of a regular shde is preferred in some 
laboratories This makes the smear nar 
rower than the shde Push the “spreader 
shde” slowly in the reverse direction along 
the other in the manner mdicated in Fig 
ure 4-'23 so that the blood flows behind 
the edge of the spreader shde If the drop 
of blood was of appropriate size the thin 
portion of the film is about 3 cm long 
The thickness of the film can be regulated 
by changing the angle at which the spreader 
shde IS held by varying the pressure and 
the speed of spreading and by using a 
smaller or larger drop of blood The film 
should not cover the enure surface of the 
slide In a good film there is a thick portion 
and a thm portion and a gradual transmon 
from one to the other The film should 
have a smooth even appearance and be 
free from ndges waves or holes 

The speed of spreading the film is a 
factor in the quahty of the preparation The 
faster it is spread the more even and the 


Laboratorv Methods 

thicker it is In films of optimum thickness 
there is some overlap of red cells in much 
of the film but even distnbuiion and sep- 
aration of red cells toward the thm tail 
However in a good smear the leukoc)tes 
should not be crowded 

It is very easy by this method to make 
large thin even films which are espeaally 
useful for studjing the erythrocjtes and 
malarial parasites The use of the slide 
preparations for making diiferenUal leuko- 
cyte counts IS less sausfactory because the 
distnbution of leukocytes is not uniform 
The films should be allowed to dry in 
the air 

Labeling the blood films The identifi 
cation can be written with a soft lead 
pencil directly on the blood film 

Tvvo-covcrglass Method This method is 
widely recommended but considerable prac 
tice is required to get good results No 0 
or No 1 coverglasses mch square are 
recommended No 2 coverglasses are too 
thick for oil immersion 

Preparation of the film Touch a cover 
glass (22 X 22 mm square) to the top o! a 
small drop of blood (about 2 to 3 mm In 
size) without touching the skin and place 
It blood side down crosswise on another 
coverglass so that the comers appear as an 
eight pointed star If the drop is not too 
large and if the coverglasses are perfecdy 
clean the blood will spread out evenly and 
quickly m a thm layer between the two 
surfaces Just as it stops spreading and 
before it begms to coagulate pull the cover 
glasses quickly but firmly apart on a plane 
parallel to their surfaces They should not 
be separated by lifting (Fig 4-24) They 
should be placed smear side up on dean

Films from venous blood may be pre 
pared similarly by touching the tip of a 
hypodermic ne^e to a coversbp placing on 
it a drop 1 to 2 mm in size and proceeding 
as described It has also been recommended 
to empty the syringe quickly into the con 
tamer with anticoagulant except for the 
last few drops to hold it in vertical position 
with the tip up and to apply gentle pressure 
on the plunger until a small drop of blood 
appears on the up The drop is then touched 
with the coverglass Venous blood with an 
anticoagulant js not suitable for the study 
of white cells Oxalate is probably the worst 
of all anticoagulants because of the pres 
ence of vacuoles and phagocytized crystals 
of oxalate Blood with other anticoagulants 
and defibrinated blood is also less satisfac 
tory for the study of leukocytes 

Sources of Error in Preparation of 
Films Separation of the slides must be 
done just at the nght moment to get good 
results If It IS done too soon the smear 
will not cover the entire slide and wjJI be 
too thick If It JS done too late the blood 
will clot and it may be difficult to pull the 
slides apart 

The coverglass method is especially to be 
recommended for accurate differential 
counts since all the leukocytes in the drop 
Will be found on the two coverglasses and 
thus the error due to unequal distribution 
can be excluded by counting all the leuko 
cytes The blood usually is much more 
evenly spread on one of the coverglasses 
than it is on the other

The aniline dyes which are extensively 
used m blood work are of two general 
classes basic dyes such as methylene blue 
and acid dyes such as eosin Nuclei and 
certain other structures in the blood are 
stained by the basic dyes and are hence 
called basophilic Certain structures take 
up only acid dyes and are called acidophilic 
oxyphUic or eosinophilic Certain other 
structures are stained b> a combination of 
the two and are called neutrophilic Rccog

^^2 Clinical Diagnosis by 

Stains. These stains, which are the out- 
growth of the original time<onsuming Ro- 
manowsky method, have largely displaced 
other blood stains for routine laboratory 
use. They may be recommended for all 
routine work. TTiey stain differentially every 
normal and abnormal structure in the 
blood. Most of them are dissolved in methyl 
alcohol and combine the fixing with the 
staining process. Numerous methods of 
preparing and applying these stains have 
been deiised, among the best known being 
Giemsa's and Wright's. 

Wright’s stain. This is a polychrome 
stain because it produces a variety of colors. 

It is a methyl alcoholic solution of an acid 
and a basic dye. It is one of the best and 
is the most ividely used stain. Wright's stain 
certified by the Commission of Staimng is 
commercially available. It is satisfactory 
and ready for use. One can also purchase 
the powder certified by the Commission on 
Staining.* The solution is prepared by dis- 
solving 0.1 gm. of powder per 60 ml. of 
chemically pure absolute methyl alcohol 
(C.P., acetone-free). The powder (0.1 gm.) 

Is ground in a mortar adding a few milli- 
liters of the alcohol at a time until 60 ml. 
have been added and the entire stain has 
gone into solution. This requires 20 to 30 
minutes. The stain should then be left 
standing for a day or two and filtered be- 
fore use. The stock dye Is filtered when 
prepared and each time when samples are 
taken from the stock. The dye is sensitive 
to contamination ivith water In reagents or 
glassware. The reagent bottle must be 
tightly stoppered at all times to prevent 
entry of water vapor Exposure to acid or 
alkaline fumes must also be avoided. 

Wright’s directions for the preparation 
and use of the stain are as follows. 

Preparation. To a 0.5 per cent aque- 
ous solution of sodium bicarbonate add 
methylene blue (B.X. or “medicinally pure”) 
in the proportion of 1 gm. of the dye to 
each 100 ml. of the solution. Heat the mix- 
ture in a steam sterilizer at 100® C. for 
one hour, counting the time after the ster- 
ilizer has become thoroughly heated. The 
mixture should be placed in a flask, or 
flasks, of such size and shape that it forms 
a layer not more than 6 cm. deep. After 
heating, allow the mixture to cool, placing 
the flask in cold water, if desired, and then 
filter it to remove the precipitate that has

Laboratory Methods 

formed in it. It should, when cold, have a 
deep purplish red color when a thin layer 
is viewed by transmitted yellowish artificial 
light. It does not show this color while it 
is warm. 

To each 100 ml. of the filtered mixture 
add 500 ml. of a 0.1 per cent aqueous 
solution of "yellowish wafer-soluble” eosin 
and mix thoroughly. CoUect the abundant 
precipitate, which immediately appears, on 
a filter. Owing to lack of uniformity in’ the 
dyes now obtainable, it may be necessary 
to add more or less of the eosin to obtain 
a satisfactory precipitate. ^Vhen the pre- 
cipitate appears, it may be recognized by 
placing a drop of the fluid on filter paper. 
Dry the precipitate thoroughly and dissoKe 
it m methyl alcohol (Merck’s reagent) in 
the proportion of 0.1 gm. to 60 ml. of the 
alcohol. In order to facilitate solution, the 
precipitate should be rubbed with the al- 
cohol in a porcelain dish or mortar with a 
spatula or pestle. This alcoholic solution 
of the precipitate is the staining fluid. It 
frequently is found that freshly made solu- 
tions stain the erythrocytes blue caving to 
slight alkalinity; however, such solutions 
usually work properly after a few months. 

Buffer for caution of Wright's stain (pH 
6.4): primary (monobasic) potassium phos* 
phate (KH 2 p 04 ), anhydrous 6.63 gm.; sec- 
ondary (dibasic) sodium phosphate 
(Na 2 HP 04 ), anhydrous 2.56 gm.; and dis- 
tilled water to make 1 L. A more alkaline 
buffer (pH 6.7) may be prepared by using 
5.13 gm. of the potassium salt and 4.12 
gm. of the sodium salt. 

Staining the Film. 1. For best re- 
sults the films should be stained as soon 
as they have been dned in the air but 
in any case not later than after a few 
hours. If they must be kept longer ivithoui 
staining, they must be fixed. In smear? 
left unfixed for a day or more, the dried 
plasma stains and produces a background 
of pale blue. Uniform staining is difficuli 
to achieve, because smears tend to vary in 
thickness except when exceptionally good 
technique is used in their preparation. 

2. Place the slide with the air-dned film 
side up on a stain rack over a pan; the 
covershp is placed best on a support, ie., 
a cork attached to the bottom of a pan 
with paraffin. 

3. Without previous fixation, co%er the 
film with a noted quantity of the staining 
fluid ivith a medicine dropper. There must 
be plenty of stain in order to avoid too 
great an evaporation and consequent pre-

fluid on the film an equal quantity of the 
buffer solution with a second medicine

blow gentli on the diluted stain on se\eral 
portions of the slide to set up gentle cur

horizontal The washing takes 5 to 30 
seconds until the thinner portions of the

preparation should be flooded with buITcred 
water while the stain is still on it If the 
stain Is poured off before rinsing the scum 
tends to settle on the blood film where it 
cUnfts in spile of subsequent washing If 
the color is too dark the excessi\e blue can 
be removed by further washing The film is 
dned by evaporation or by blotting gently 
With filter paper The stain remaining on 
the back of the slide is removed vvuh gauze 
moistened in alcohol

mounted on a slide with neutral Canada 
balsam 

Coverglass films may be mounted tern 
poranly by placing them blood slide down 
on a glass slide on which a drop of im 
mersion oil has been placed Using a drop 
of isobutyl methacrylate dissolved in xylol 


or toluol at in approximately neutral pH 
will give permanent mounts 

Films stained well with Wnghts stain 
have a pink color when viewed with the 
naked eye and give the following picture on 
microscopic exammation (see Plates 4-1 
4-2 4-3 4-5) ^Vhen inspected under low 
power magnification of the microscope the 
cells should be evenly distributed and sep 
arated from each other The red cells are 
pink not lemon yellow or red they are 
lying flat without overlapping or forming 
rouleaux At least eight satisfactory low 
power fields on a slide are present m a 
good preparation They should be free from 
artcracts such as vacuoles The nuclei of 
leukocytes are purplish blue the basi and 
oxjcliromatin clearly differentiated and the 
c>toplasmic neutrophilic granules lilac or 
violet pink The cosinophihc granules are 
rtd and each distinctly discernible so that 
one may count the Individual granules 
There should be only a minimum of pre 
cipitate The areas between the cells are 
clear The color of the film should be um 
form without pale or dark green areas in 
dicaiivt of excessive staming of thick por 
tions of film 

The blood ceUs appear as follows eryth 
rocytes yeliow or pink nuclei various 
shades of purple neutrophilic granules red 
dish lihe sometimes pink eosinophilic 
granules bright red basophilic granules of 
leukocytes and degenerated erythrocytes 
very dark bluish purple thrombocytes dark 
Llac bacteria blue The cytoplasm of 
lymphocytes is generally robin s-egg blue 
that of the monocytes has a famt bluish 
tinge Malarial parasites stain charactens 
t/caily the cytopJasm sky blue the chro 
matin purplish red These colors are not 
invariable two films stained from the same 
bottle sometimes differ greatly In general 
a preparation is satisfactory when both the 
nuclei and the neutrophilic granules are 
distinct regardless of their color and when 
the film is free from precipitated dye In 
addition it is desirable but not essential 
that the erithrocyles be a clear pink or 
yellowish pink they should not be blue 
The colors are prone to fade if the prepare 
tjon is mounted in a poor quality of balsam 
or if it Is exposed to the light 

Failure to get saUsfactory results with 
the polychrome methylene blue-eosin stains 
when they are properly used may be due 
to imperfect polychrommg of the powder 
but is most frequently due to incorrect 
reaction of the staining fluid When tlie 



Climcai Diacnosis 

solution IS too acid (pH too low) the eryth 
roc>tes stain bright red and the nuclei of 
the leukocytes are pale sk> blue or e\en 
colorless When the reaction is too alkaline 
(pH too high) the erythroc>tes stain deep 
slate blue and there is little diffcrcnuation 
of colors The reaction of the solution is 
determined partly by that of the pouder 
when as is the case ivith Wnghts slain 
Its reaction is not accuratelj adjusted but 
It depends to a sull greater degree on the 
methyl alcohol ivhich is prone to develop 
formic acid as a result of oxidation on 
standing A given powder may afford per 
feet results when dissolved m methyl al 
cohol from a freshly opened bottle but may 
produce poor results when dissolved in the 
same lot of alcohol after it has stood for 
some months exposed to the air Detenora 
tion of old solutions is largely due to the 
same cause Pathologic blood will some 
times not stain well with solutions that are 
correct for normal blood 

If American Wnghts stain is used the 
decolonzer recommended by Schleicher 
(1942) is useful Mix 0 S ml of acetone 
and 5 0 ml of methyl alcohol with 100 ml 
of freshly disuUed water After staining 
with diluted Wnghts stain place the slide 
in the decolorucr for from one to five sec 
ends The exact time must be determined 
for each individual Wnghts stain prepara 
tion Wash the decolonzer off the sbde 
with distilled water 

Some Causes of Bad Results 1 
Causes of excessively blue stain thick 
films overstainmg inadequate washing or 
too high an alkahmt> of stain or diluent 
In such smears the erythrocytes appear blue 
or green the nuclear chromatin is deep blue 
to black and the granules of the ncu 
trophilic granulocytes are deeply over 
stained and appear large and prominent 
The granules of the eosinophils are blue or 
gray Such stain can be corrected b> stain 
ing for a shorter time with the stain Itself 
and for a longer lime with the diluent or 
by using less stain and more diluent If 
these steps are inelTective the buffer may 
be too alkaline and a new one should be 
prepared When the water is too alkaline 
the pH of the buffer may have to be raised 
to 6 7 

2 Causes of excessively pink stain in 
sufficient staining too long a washing 
mounting the coverslips before they are 
dry or too high an acidity of the stain 
buffer or water In such smears the erythro- 
cytes are bnght red or orange and not pink 


Lauoratorv Mftiiods 

the nuclear chromatin is pale blue and the 
granules of the eosinophils arc sparkling 
brilliant red One of the causes of the in 
creased acidity is exposure of the stain or 
buffer to acid fumes The situation may be 
corrected bv a new batch of stain or buffer 
If the local tap water is alkaline using it 
in place of distilled water may improve the 
stain 

Causes of pale inadequalelv stained red 
rells nuclei or eosinophilic granules un 
derstaining or excessive washing Prolong 
mg the staining or reducing the washing 
may solve the problem 

3 Causes of precipitate on the film un 
clean slides drying durmg the period of 
staining inadequate washing of the stain 
at the end of the staining period especially 
failure to hold the slide horizontally during 
washing or inadequate filtration of the 
stain and permitting dust to settle on the 
slide or smear 

0//ier useful blood slams Although 
Wnghts stain suffices for most clinical 
work and is to be recommended if only one 
blood stain is to be used certain other 
stains demand bnef mention 

Giemsas Staiv This widely used stain 
1 $ probably the best modification of Roman 
ovvskys stain for demonstrating blood para 
sites and other protozoa and it is also highlv 
satisfactory as a routine blood stain Its 
composition is as follows 

AzurII-co«in SOsm 

Azurll 0 6 am 

Glycerin (Merck CP ) 250 0 ml 

Methyl alcohol (Kahlbaum I or

The solution is troublesome to make and 
IS best purchased already prepared Blood 
films are fixed In methyl alcohol and arc 
then immersed for 20 minutes or longer in a 
freshly prepared mixture of 1 ml of stain 
and 10 ml of distilled water In order to 
prevent precipitate from forming on them 
the slides or coverglass should be placed 
on the edge in the stain Satisfactory re- 
sults may also be obtained by placing aliout 
30 drops of distilled w atcr on the fixed film 
adding 3 drops of Giemsas stain mixlnc

Study of Slotued lilood T tims 


It has been said with much truth that an 
intelligent study of the stained film together 
with an estimation of the concentration of 
hemoglobin wtU yield 90 per cent of all 
the diagnostic information obtalmblc b% 
examination of the blood The stained films 
furnish the best means of studying the 
morphology of the blood and blood para

globin and of the number of ervthrocytes

the erythrocytes when not crowded lo- 
gether appear as circulir homogeneous 
disks of nearly uniform size ranging from 


6 to 8 microns in diameter (Fig A 23)

(Plate 4—1 [1]) Abnormal variation in sire 
IS called anisocytosis (Plate 4-2 Fig 4-26) 

Variation in shape is often marked Oial 
pear shaped saddle shaped club shaped 
and irregularly shaped erythrocytes are 
common (Fig 4-26) These are called poi 
kiloc^tes and their presence is spoken of as 
poikilocytosis (Plate 4-1 (21) Elliptic eryth 
locytes have been reported in healthy per 
sons as an hereditary anomaly (otaJocjto 
SIS or elliptocytosis) (Plate 4-1 (5() which 
IS inherited as a mendeUan dominant Its 
association with anemia will be discussed 
later 

Spherocytes ate nearly spherical erythro 
cytes in contradistinction to normal bicon 
cave disks Their diameter is smaller than 
normal They lack the central pale area 
They show increased fragility in hypotome 
salt solutions and are found m hereditary 
spherocytosis and in smaller numbers in 
some cases of acquired hemolytic anemia 
(Plate 4-1 (6]) “Target cells are epthro-

These cells seem to be more resistant to

Erythrocytes that ^a^y from the nonnal

The variations include polychromato-

and malanal stippbng 

Polychromatophiha The affected erythro- 
cytes do not show normal affinity for acid 
stains and instead take the basic stain 
(Plate 4-3 (21) Wnghts stain gives such 
cells a bluish enge ranging from faint to 
fairly deep The color Is a mixture of the 
blue of residual ribonucleic acid and the 
red of hemoglobm The cells are larger than

onm blue or Wnghts stain The er>throcyte 
containing them may stain normally in 
other respects or it maj exhibit polychro- 
matophilia Polychromatophilic erythrocytes 
generally contain small granules which 
may be so fine that the erythrocytes appear 
dusted with them Basophilic stippbng may 
also be seen in nucleated red cells Sup 
pling IS attnbuted to degenerative changes 
in the cytoplasm imolvmg nbonucleic acid 
in the young cell 

In mdustnes employing lead health con 
trol includes counting stippled cells In 50 
fields of 50 cells each (a total of 2500 
erythrocytes) The presence of 11 or more 
stippled cells per 2500 red cells is an indi 
cation of excessue exposure and of the 
need of correction Stippling is a sign of 
exposure and not of lead poisoning There 
IS no direct relationship between the num 
ber of stippled red ceUs and the degree of 
toxicity 

Suppled cells can probably be found in 
every case in which there are climcal symp 
toms of lead poisoning and in some cases 
of severe poisoning they are present m 
nearly every microscopic field Except in 
lead exposure the degeneration indicates a 
senous blood disease It is present m severe 
pernicious anemia and leukemia and much 
less commonly in other forms of severe 
anemia 

'Malarial Suppling This term has been 
apphed to the finely granular appearance 
of erythrocytes that harbor the parasites of 
tertian malana It was formerly classed 
wth basophilic stippling but is undoubtedly 
different Not all slams show it With 
Wnghts stain U can be brought out by 
staining longer and washing less than usual 
when oidinaty blood is examined The 
minute granules Schuffners granules” 
stain purplish red They are sometimes so 
numerous that they almost hide the para 
sites These red cells are as a rule larger 
than normal 

Vartattons tn Slntcture 

The most important \ anation in the 
structure of erythrocytes in the peripheral 
blood is the absence of a nucleus As a rule 
the nucleus in normoblasts is small round 
and sharply defined The structure of these 
nuclei is different from that of the nuclei 
of leukocy tes As a rule they are the most 
deeply stained nuclei to be seen in the 
blood film being approached in this respect 


Labor VTORV Methods 

only by the nuclei of the smaller lympho- 
cytes loung normoblasts are large Their 
nuclei are relatively large and the chro- 
matin is arranged in a more or less reticular 
manner with clean cut open spaces The 
openings are arranged at the penphery and 
with the chromatin bars between them sug 
gest a wheel with broad spokes Mitosis 
may be seen occasionally especially in leu 
kemia and untreated pernicious anemia 
The cytoplasm is blue with a mixture of 
red or purple as evadcnce of hemoglobin 
formation (basophihc normoblast pronibri 
cyte) The older normoblasts arc smaller 
Their nuclei also are smaller and more 
dense some are entirely homogeneous and 
stain very deeply (pyknouc nuclei) These 
are likely to be situated eccenlricallj and 
sometimes appear as if they are being ex 
truded from the normoblasts These char 
aclenstics are shown m Figure 4-28 
With increased production of hemoglobin 
the blue color of the cytoplasm is pro- 
gressively replaced by red (polychromato- 
philic normoblast rubneyte) until it as 
sumes the orange color of the nonnoblast 
(ortho''hromatic normoblast metarubn 
cyte) It is important to distinguish the 
younger normoblasts from the older ones 
As a result of degenerative changes the 
nuclei may be irregular m shipe (Fig 
4-29) and clover leaf forms are common 
On the other hand they may be completely' 
broken up into fragments— the so-called 
Howell Jolly bodies (Fig 4-^0) of which 
ail but one or two may have isappeircd 
from the normoblast These particles arc 
smooth round remnants of the parachro- 
matin of the nucleus (Plate 4-3 [4i ) 

The megaloblast (Plate 4-3 [6] Fig 4- 
31 ) is a distinct cell not merely a larger nor 
mobiasi It Is present in pernicious anemia 
and in related macrocytic anemias Tlie cells 
of this senes are not found in the normal 
marrow They are all larger than the cor 
responding cells of the normal senes De- 
ficiency of vitamin B,-. or folic acid is re- 
sponsible The result is abnormal nucleic 
acid synthesis and defective development of 
the nucleus The cells grow longer without 
dividing Iron hemoglobin synthesis Is as a 
rule essentially normal The result of the 
discrepanev in the growth of liie nucleus 
and cytoplasm is the formation of abnor 
mally large cells with an increased amount 
of hemoglobin in the cytoplasm and an 
immature nuclear chromatin pattern 
The morphologic differences including 
the abnormally large size arc due to the

senes usually has nucleoli It js large, 
round or oval The cytoplasm stains deeply 
blue with a light juxtanuclear zone It has 


a more delicate chromatin network with 
larger and more numerous openings than

aloblast, the nucleus becomes smaller (Fig 
4-32) and the chromatin denser, coarser, 
and more solidly stained Nuclei of megalo 
blasts at the end stages of de\eIopment 
may show degenerative changes (pyknosis, 
karyorrhexis) The end stage is a megalo 
cyte, a larger anuclear cell without the 
central pale zone of the normocjte and as 
a rule wth abundant hemoglobin At the 
same time, the entire megalohlast becomes 
smaller and the cytoplasm shows less tend

of meg^oblasts is important, but is not 
always easy unless the nucleus is typical 
Mitosis may occur as m the nuclei of nor

ERYT linOCYTES 

Normoblasts are present normally only 
in the blood of the fetus and of very young 
infants In the healthy adult they are con 
fined to the bone marrow and appear in 
the circula ing blood only in disease m 
which their presence denotes an excessive 
demand made on the blood forming organs 
to regenerate erythrocytes In response to 
this demand immature and Imperfectly 
formed cells are thrown into the circulation 
Their number therefore is usually regarded 
as an indication of the extent to which the 
bone marroiv reacts rather than of the 
scicntj of the disease A contributing fic 
tor may be a “lowered bone marrow thresh 
old " which allows immature cells to pass 
Into the circulation more readily at some 
times than at others Occasionally great 
numbers of nucleated erythrocytes appear 
rather suddenly Tins is called a blood crisis 
and the name is rather arbitrarily appbed 
whenever there are more than five nucleated 
erythrocytes for every hundred leukocytes 

In general normoblasts appear when re 
generation of blood takes place in a normal 
manner although with excessive activity 
They are found in severe anemia leukemia 
and pernicious anemia They arc often 
abundant in granulocytic leukemia In per 
mcious anemia they are often dlfilcult to 
find In eryihxdblastosis 5c\a\» tliervs ate 
abnormally large numbers of normoblasts 
This disease of the newborn is charactemed 
by splenomegaly an enlarged liver jaun 
dice and a macrocytic anemia if the disease 
is caused by Rh (blood factor) incompati 
faility If the disease is caused by AB Wood 
factor incompatibility varying numbers of 
spherocytes are present but macrocytes are 
rare or absent Nuclear particles or Howell 
Jolly bodies are common in untreated per 
nicious anemia and have been noted m 
greatest numbers after splenectomy 

The presence of megaloblasts indicates 
a change in the type of blood formation 
This IS seen most characteristically in per 
nicious anemia and the presence of meg 
aloblasts in the marrow is therefore im 
portant m the diagnosis of this disease 
although less significance is attached to 


them than formerly They are probably 
present m every case of untreated disease 
but may be rare in patients treated ade 
quatcly with vitamin B or folic acid In 
pauents who have not been treated ade 
quatcly they may exceed normoblasts in 
number — a ratio that is extremely rare in 
other diseases in which they have been 
found 


LEUKOCYTES 


The total white blood cell count is de 
tcmiined in the countmg chamber (see p 
84 fF ) The same applies to the eosinophils 
for which a special countmg chamber is 
available The percentage distribution of the 
different types of leukocytes and the quaUta 
tive study is done on a stained smear S ich 
stud) IS called differential count It prob 
ably yields more helpful information than 
any other single procedure used in ex 
amination of the blood 

Wnghts stam is probably most widely 
used A thin blood film is best for the study 
of details and identification of the cells 
One should first glance over the preparation 
to note the general tinting of leukocytes 
Two films stained side by side will often 
show marked differences in the color reac 
tions of the leukocytes 
To make the differential count the film 
IS examined carefully with an oil immersion 
objective using a mechanical stage Each 
leukocyte seen is classified and the percent 
age of each cell type is calculated For 
accuracy 500 to 1000 leukocytes should be 
classified For practical reasons a smaller 
number is classified It is imperative to 
count leukocytes m all parts of the film 
since the different varieties may be un 
evenly distributed A record of the count 
may be kept by placing a mark for each 
leukocyte in its appropriate column ruled 
on paper It is more convenient to use one 
of several commercially available record 
Jng tabulators (Fig 4-^5) They have a 
separate key for each type of blood cor 
puscle and the percentages can be read 
directly as the instrument automatically

counted Leukoc>tes that cannot be classi 
fied should be placed together in an umden 
tified group In some conditions notably 
leukemia there may be man) of these un 
identified leukocytes 

The actual number of each vanety of 
leukocyte in a cubic millimeter of blo^ is 
easily calculated from these percentages 
and the total leukocyte count It should 
form part of the record if this is to be com 
plete An increase m actual number is an 
absolute increase and an increase in per 
centage only a relative increase It is ev-i 
dent that an absolute increase of any variety 
may be accompamed by a relative decrease 

One should always make it a rule when 
making a differential count to attempt to 
estimate the total leukocyte count from the 
number of leukocytes seen m a field with 
the low power objective After some prac 
tice this can be done with a considerable 
degree of accuracy 

One should remember that In addition to 
the differential count the examinauon of 
the blood smear provides an excellent op 
portunity to study and to note the mor 
phology of the red cells The number of 
nucleated erythrocytes seen while making 
the count should also be noted m the record 

It IS unfortunate that differenual leuko 
eyte counts ordinarily made on films on 
slides are often extremely unreliable owing 
to irregular isinbunon of leukocytes which 
may be very great in thin films For this 
reason many workers totally condemn the 
use of sUdes for differential counting Un 
doubtedly good coverglass films allow an 
accurate differential count but only wheii- 
every leukocyte on both coverglasses is 
classified winch is impracticable in routine 
work since it requires classification of 8000 
to 30 000 leukocytes The distribution of 
leukocytes on the coverglass is not how 
ever more umform than on properly pre 
pared films on slides A definite number of 
leukocytes (100 or 200) is then classified 
in each of three areas extending across the 
filni— one at the beginning one m the mid 
die and one at the end and reaching to 
the very edges of the film UTien the count 
IS made in this way the percentage of poly 
morphonuclear neutrophils (which is taken 
as the criterion because of the unlikelihood 
of errors m classification) usually agrees 
within two points with the true percentage 
as ascertained by classifying every leuko- 
cyte on two coverglass films made from the 
same sample

Aormaf Types of Leiikocytes 
Lymphocyte 

LyTnphocy tes are small mononuclear 
cells without specific cytoplasmic granules 
They arc about the size of an crytbrocyteor 
sbghily larger (6 to 10 microns) alUiough 
their diameter is influenced to a great de 
gree by the thickness of the film being 
greatest in very thin films in which the 
leukocytes arc much flattened The typical 
lymphocyte has a single sharply definca 
nucleus containing heavy blocks of chr^ 
matin The chromatin stains dark blue with 
Wnghts stain while the parachromaw 
stands out as lighter stained streaks at the 
penphery of the nucleus the chromatin is

There is at present a tendency toward 
greater conservatism in ascnbing diagnostic 
significance to lymphocytosis of moderate 
degree that is of less than AQ per cent 
unless the normal for the individual has 
been established previously Lymphocytic 
percentages as lo%v as 15 and as high as 
45 are found occasionally in apparently 
healthy persons 

-/Monocyte 

Monocytes include leukocytes that for 
merly ^vere classified as farge mononuclear 
leukocytes endothelial leukocytes and 
transitional leukocytes (Fig 4-37) 

The monocyte is the largest corpuscle of 
normal blood It generally is about two to 
three times the diameter of an erythrocyte 
(14 to 20 microns) although smaller mon 
ocytes sometimes are encountered It con 
tains a single nucleus which is lobulated 
deeply indented or horseshoe shaped Oc 
casionally the nucleus of a monocyte may 
appear round or oval Careful inspection 
and adjustment of the oil immersion lens 
to observe the nucleus at several levels 
reveals that even in those cases there is an 
indentation of the nucleus which is ob 
soured by the position of the cell 

The zone of protoplasm surrounding the 
nucleus Is relatively wide With Wnghts 
stain the characteristic feature of the nu 
cleus IS for the chromatin to be in strands 
There is also a reiatneiy sharp distmchon 
between the chromatin and the parachro-

plasm its bluish grey color evidences of 
phagocytosis and the depth of color and 
the folds and indentations of the nucleus 
usually with the absence of peripheral con 
densation of nuclear chromatin and of a 
clear perinuclear zone are the points to be 
considered in distinguishing monocytes that 
have a round nucleus from lymphocytes 
For comparison condensation of nuclear 
chromatin in clump s and at the nuclear 
margin a perinuclear clear zone in the 
cytoplasm and a homogeneous agranular 
cytoplasm are characteristic for lympho- 
cytes It must be borne m mind that the 
thickness of the film has a great influence 
on the apparent size of all leukocytes They 
are larger and paler when flattened out In 
very thin films 

Comparauvely htUe is known regarding 
the origin of the monocytes and it is pos 
sible that more than one cell is included 
There have been many reports by Sabin 
Doan and their associates of their studies 
in hematology with supravital stains (Doan 
and Wiseman 1934 Sabin 1923 Snbln 
ct al 1925) Monocytes constitute about 2 
to 6 per cent of the total number of leuko* 
cytes in the peripheral blood — 100 to 600 
for each cubic millimeter of blood Only a 
few pathologic conditions raise this figure 
to any great degree A distinct increase to 
J5 per cent or even higher is a feature of 
the blood in typhoid fever and may be of 
some value in differential diagnosis It is 
also increased in malana in which many of 
the monocytes sometimes contim engulfed

age of monocytes (12 to 40 per cent) has 
been reported Other conditions in which an 
increase is usual are subacute bacterial en

Segmented Neutrophiuc GnANULocyxE 

(POLYIUORPirONUCLEAR NEUTROPirttrc 

Leukocyte) 

There is usuaHy no difficulty in recogniz- 
ing these cells. Their average diameter 
(about 12 microns) is decideffiy less than 
that of the monocytes. The nudeus stains 
deeply; it is irregular and often assumes 
shapes comparable to such letters as E, Z, 
and S (Fig. 4-38). Frequently there appear 
to be several separate nudei, hence, the 
widely used name "polynuclear leukocyte.” 
On careful inspection, however, delicate fil- 
aments connecting the segments can usu- 
ally be seen. Occasionally it may be difficult 
to recognize whether one Is deding with a 
segmented or nonsegmented ccllv-especially 
in thick smears. In such cases, finding that 
the margin of a segment can be traced from 
one side across the narrowed portion to 
the margin on the other side indicates that 
the lobes are overlying and that the nudeus 
is segmented. The cytoplasm is abundant 
and contains great numbers of fine neu- 
trophilic granules. ^Vhen stained with 
Wright’s stain, the chromatin of the nucleus 
is purple and the cytoplasmic granules arc 
lilac, while In the weU-stained preparation 
the cytoplasm itself is light pmk or aci- 
dophilic. 

Segmented neutrophilic granulocytes are 
formed in the marrow from neutrophilic 
mydocytes. Ordinarily they constitute 50 to 
70 per cent of all the leukocytes, and 3000 


127 

to 7000 are present in each cubic millimeter 
of normal blood. Occasionally, in normal 
adults, the percentage of these leukocytes 
may be as low as 40 or as high as 80. In 
children, the average varies from about 33 
per cent in the first year to 50 per cent in 
the tenth. Any marked increase in their 
number practically always produces an in- 
crease in the total leukocyte count. Tlie 
leukocytes of pus, pus corpuscles, belong 
almost wholly to this variety. 

In infectious and inflammatory condj- 
tions, notably pneumonia and appendicitis, 
a comparison of the percentage of neu- 
trophilic granulocytes with the total leu- 
kocyte count yields more information than 
a consideration of either alone. In a general 
way, as was first pointed out by Sondem 
(1906), the percentage represents the se- 
verity of the infection, or, more correctly, 
the degree of toxic absorption, and the re- 
sponse to the exogenous leukocytosis stimu- 
lating factor, while the total count Indicates 
the patient’s power of resistance. With mod- 
erate infection and good resisting powers, 
the leukocyte count and the percentage are 
increased proportionately. When the neu- 
trophilic percentage is increased to a 
notably greater extent than is the total num- 
ber of leukocytes, no matter how low the 
count, either a lost resistance or a severe 
infection may be inferred. 

It is a matter of observation that in the 
absence of acute infectious disease or of 
inflammation directly in the blood (for ex- 
ample. phlebitis, sigmoid sinusitis, and sep- 
tic endocarditis), a neutrophilic percentage 
of 85 or more points very strongly to gan-

grene or pus formation somewhere m the 
body On the other hand, except in children, 
pus IS uncommon with less than 80 per cent

Exceptions to these rules occur chiefly in 
cases m which the patients are monbund,

infections 

'/Ameth’s Classification o£ Neutrophilic 
Pclj-morphonuclear Granulocytes Amelh 
(1904) grouped the polymorphonuclear 
neutrophibc granulocytes into file classes 
according to the number of lobes their nu 
clei possess Three fourths of the normal 
polymorphonuclear neutrophilic granulo- 
cytes have two or three nuclear divisions 
In all fi\e different classes Ameth num 
bered from left to right according to whether 
the leukocytes ha\e one, two, three, four 
five, or more segments By makmg a count 
of the neutrophils according to this classi 
fication, the percentage indicates the num 
her of youngest cells An increase of the 
class with Jess segments at the expense of 
the classes with more segments is known as 
a v^shift of the neutropluUc blood picture 
to the left ” while the opposite condition is 
known as a “shift to the nght " 

The ‘Ameth index" at one time was used 
by adding the first and second classes and 
half the third class The average normal is 
about 60 with variations between 51 and 
65 However, the “Ameth index" is httle 
used now because the simplification known 
as the Schilling count and the even simpler 
Slameat and nonfila men t counts are more 
practical 

The Schilling Count The original Ameth 
count has been modified and cnticized by 
many workers One of these, Schilling 
(1924 1929), has developed a much sim 
pier classification The technique descnbed

They may be present before the other signs 
of pernicious anemia are present. 

Eosinophilic Granulocyte (Eosinophil) 

The structure of these cells is similar to 
that of the poljTnorphonuclear neutrophils 
with the sinking difference that, instead of 
the neutrophilic granules, their cytoplasm 
contains coarse, round or oval granules 
hating a strong affinity for acid stains (Fig. 
4-40). They are easily recognized by the 
size and color of the granules, which stain 
bright red with stains containing eosln. In 
weU'Stained preparations a distinct high- 
light can be seen on each granule. Tlieir 
cytoplasm generally has a faint sky-blue 
tinge, and the nucleus stains somewhat less 
deeply than that of the polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils. 

Eosinophils are formed in the bone mar* 
tow from eosinophilic myelocytes. Their 
normal number varies from SO to 250 for 
each cubic millimeter of blood and they 
comprise 1 to 4 per cent of the leukocytes. 
An increase is called eosinophilia, and it is 
better determined by the actual number per 
cubic millimeter as calculated than by the 
percentage. 

Marked eosinophilia — above 6 or 7 per 
cent or aboi'e 400 cells per cubic millimeler 
' — is probably always pathologic. 

Basophilic Granulocyte (BASonriL) 

In general, basophilic granulocytes re- 
semble polymorphonuclear neutrophils, ex- 
cept that the nucleus is less irregular (usu- 
ally merely indented or slightly lobulatcd) 
and granules are larger and have a strong 
affinity for basic stains (Fig. 4-41). They 
are easily recognized. In some basophils, 
most of the granules may be missing owing 
to their ready soJubUity in water, Icarfng 
clean-cut openings In the cytoplasm. The 
granules then are a mauve color. In a well- 
prepared smear stained with M'right’s stain. 


the granules arc deep purple, while the 
nucleus is somewhat paler and is often 
nearly or completely hidden by the gran- 
ules so that its form is difficult to distin- 
guish. Because of their small numbers 
basophils, just as eosinophils, are reported 
as a group ivithout subdividing them info 
the various developmental stages. 

Unevenly stained granules of basophils 
may bo ring shaped and resemble f/isfo- 
ptasma ct7psulatum or protozoa. 

There is some uncertainty as to the origin 
of the basophilic leukocytes. Most authors 
believe that they originate in the bone mar- 
row from basopliiJic myelocytes. They are 
the least numerous of the leukocytes in 
normal blood and rarely comprise more 
than 0.5 per cent of the leukocytes. Tliere 
usually are 25 to 50 basophils in each 
cubic millimeter. 


Abiioniwl Types of Leukocytes 

‘llVELOCYTES 

Myelocytes are ’farge mononuclear cells 
that have cytoplasm that is filled with gr.in- 
ulcs (Plates 4-15. 4-lC). Tj^plcally the nu- 
cleus occupies about half of the myelocyte 
and is round or oval or indented with Its 
convex side in contact with the periphery 
of the cell. It stains rather feebly and rarely 
contains nucleoli. The average diameter of 
myelocytes (about 15 microns) Is greater 
than that of any other leukocyte, but there 
is much variation in size among Individual 
cells. 

Myelocytes arc named neuirophflfc. eosin- 
ophilic. and basophilic myclocy’tes accord- 
ing to the character of their granules. Tlicsc 
granules arc identical with the correspond- 
ing granules in the leukocytes just de- 
scribed. Tlicy arc. however, often less dis- 
tinct and loss sharply distinguished liy the 
various stains than tliosc of the correspond- 
ing polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In some.

granules which take a purple color with 
Wnghts stain These finally give place to 
true neutrophilic granules Sometunes only 
a portion of the cytoplasm near the nu 
cleus IS filled with granules the periphery 
or at least one edge retaining the smooth 
basophilic cytoplasm of the parent myelo 
blast (See Plate 4-16) Although the occur 
rence of two kinds of granules m the same 
cell IS rare a few basophilic granules are 
sometunes seen in young eosinophilic myelo 
cytes The basophilic myelocyte is usually 
small and its nucleus is commonly so pale 
and so obscured by the granules that the cell 
IS not easily distmguished from more mature 
forms 

The small neutrophiUc cell with a single 
small round deeply stainmg nucleus which 
is sometimes encountered must not be con 
fused with the myelocyte Such atypical 
cells probably result from division of poly 
morphonuclear neutrophils 

Myelocytes are the bone marrow cells 
from which the corresponding segmented 
granular leukocytes are developed They 
in turn are derived from certain nongran 
ular cells of the bone marrow the myelo 
blasts Tbeir presence in the blood in con

Eosinophdic myelocytes are found as a 
rule only m granulocytic leukeima in 
which they are often numerous Basophilic 
granulocytes are Jess common and are con 


fined to long standing severe granulocytic

Myeloblasts 

Myeloblasts are the parent cells of the 
myelocytes from which they differ chiefly 
in the absence of specific granules They 
are about the size of myelocytes Their 
round or oval nuclei are poor m chromatin 
have a finely reticular or so-called sieve like 
structure and contain several rather uidis 
tinct nucleob which are generally pale blue 
when stained with the usual stain and are 
outbned by a ring of denser chromatin 
(Plate 4-19) The cytoplasm which is gen 
erally not abundant is basophilic and stains 
blue with Wnghts stam In some prepara 
tions it IS charactcnsticaUy smooth m 
texture in others it is finely reticular 

Myeloblasts appear m the blood m large 
numbers in acute granulocytic leukemia 
and in the termmal stages of chronic gran 
ulocytic leukemia Their number is there- 
fore important in prognosis They may be 
indistinguishable morphologically from the 
lymphoblasts of acute lymphocytic leukemia 
but can usually be distinguished by the 
peroxidase reaction In almost all cases of 
advanced granulocytic leukemia all stages 
of transition between the myeloblast and 
myelocyte may be found 

Peroxidase Test The technique of Good 
pasture which has been found saUsfactory 
IS as follows 

1 Prepare dned films on shdes or cov 
erglasses in the usual way 

2 Cover the film with a measured 
amount of Goodpasture s stam and let stand 
one znamte The composition of Goodpas 
ture s stain is as follows 


Alcohol 100 OO ml 

Sodium lutroprusside 0 05 gm- 

Bensadine (CP) 0 05 gm 

Basic fuchsm 0 Oo gm 

Hydrogen peroxide 0 5 ml 



131 


The Blood 


Dissolve the jiitroprusside in 1 or 2 ml. 
of water, mix wth the alcohol, and then 
add the other ingredients. In order to se- 
cure satisfactory staining of the nuclei, it 
may be necessary to double the amount of 
basic fuchsin, owing probably to a differ- 
ence in strength of dye. 

Goodpasture’s stain remains good only a 
few days. Without the hydrogen peroxide, 
the stain will give satisfactory results for 
about eight months. A freshly made 1 to 
200 dilution of hydrogen peroxide is then 
used in place of water for diluting the stain 
on the slide. This solution is made vvith 
sufficient accuracy by adding 2 drops of 
hydrogen peroxide to 15 ml. of distilled 
water. 

3. Add an equal amount of water or of 
the 1 to 200 dilution of hydrogen peroxide 
if the modification described in the preced- 
ing paragraph is used. 

4. Rinse well in water, dry by blotting, 
and examine with an oil immersion objec- 
tive. \Vhen stained by this method, the 
nuclei are clear red, the cytoplasm and 
thrombocytes are pale pink, and the erythro- 
cytes are a buff color. Cells that give the 
peroxidase reaction — polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils, eosinophils, myelocyces, and 
occasionally a few granules in monocytes — 
contain sharply defined, deep blue gran- 
ules. Such granules are lacking in lympho- 
cytes. 

Osgood and Aslnvonh IModlfication. A 
modification of AVashbum’s method by Os- 
good and Ashworth (1937) has been recom- 
mended as trustworthy.

Residts 

In neutrophilic granulocytes, there are 
many large blue-black granules. 

In promyelocytes, the granules are fewer. 

In monocytes, the granules are few, small, 
and blue-green. 

In eosinophils, the granules are large and 
bronze colored. 

In basophils, I'acuole-like spaces remain 
because the granules of basophils are water 
soluble. 

Lymphoblasts 

In acute lymphocytic leukemia there ap- 
pears in the blood a high percentage of 
very young cells of the lymphocytic series 
that are called lymphoblasts. In many cases 
they are indistinguishable from the large 
or immature lymphocytes previously de- 
scribed as occasionally occurring in the 
blood of normal adults and more frequently 
In that of children. Azure granules are 
sometimes seen in the cytoplasm and the 
nucleus generally contains nucleoli (Plates 
4-20, 4-21). At times the nucleus is curi- 
ously lobulated and the name "Rieder's 
cell” is then applied. 

Lymphoblasts are sometimes morpho- 
logically indistinguishable from myeloblasts 
but do not give the peroxidase reaction. 

Tubx’s Ibbitation Leukocyte 

These are large, mononuclear, nongran- 
ular cells with a dense, opaque, strongly 
basophilic cytoplasm, which often contains 
vacuoles. With Wright’s and similar st.ains, 
the cytoplasm stains almost as intensely 
as the nucleus although of a different color, 
being deep blue while the nucleus is deep 
purplish red. The nuclear chromatin shows 
no tendency to radial arrangement. Nucleoli 
are usually present. 

The nature of the irritation leukocytes is 
not definitely known, and at present no di- 
agnostic importance can be ascribed to 
them. Considerable numbers have been 
found in the blood conditions associated 
with irritation of the bone marrow, notably 
anemia, leukemia, and malaria and In the 
leukocytosis of pneumonia. 

Plasma Cells 

Morphologically, plasma cells arc very 
similar to Turk’s irritation leukocytes. The 
nudeus of the plasma coll may show a 
tendency toNvard a radial or “whoeMike” 
arrangement of its chromatin (see Plate 
4-4).

Thrombocytes ha%c been much studied 
but aside from the facts mentioned under 
their enumeration they have Umited diag 
nosUc \alue At present the accepted ex 
planaiion of their origin is that of J H 
Wright (1910) who regarded them as de 
tached portions of the c^oplasm of certain 
giant ceils (megakaryocytes ) of the bone mar 
row The megakaryocyte illustrated in Plate 
4--4 Is magnified about 500 diameters if it 
were drawn to the scale of the other cells it 
would be four times as large The giant 
cells push cytoplasmic processes into the 
capillanes and these break off and appear 
in the circulating blood as thrombocytes 

Megakaryoblasts precursors of megakary 
ocytes occasionally find their way Into the 
blood particularly in conditions in wliich 
the bone marrow is extremely active as in 
granulocytic leukemia The megakaryocyies 
are too large to pass the capillanes and 
are arrested in the lungs but occasionally 
the smaller cells may pass the lungs and 
appear in the peripheral circulation^ 

HEM VTOPOIESIS 

A complete consideration of how blood 
corpuscles are formed in embtyomc and 
adult life belongs m the province of his 
tology and is of little practical importance

life the bone marrow lymphoid structures 
and connective assues contain the piecur 
sors of the mature cells (hemocytes) found 
in the circulating blood in normal persons 
and of the immature cells found in the blood 


Blood 133 

m pathologic conditions Hematologists do 
not agree whether the several cells of the 
circulating blood have a common origin 
from one type of cell — the Unitarian hy 
IKithesis of Downey Ferrata Pappenheim 
and many others — or from two or more 
primitive blood cells as advocated by the 
polyphyletists represented by Piney Nae 
geli Schilling Posenthal Osgood Sabm 
Cunningham and Doan to mention only a 
few of the well known hematologists sup 
porting the latter vaew 

The VnUartnn Hypothesu 

According to the unitanans the precur 
sor or mother cell of all blood cells is the 
undi^erentiated mesenchymal cell which is 
found in the adult as the reticuloendothelial 
cell also called reticulum cell a fixed tissue 
cell and not a blood cell This cell has the 
capacity to develop into any other cell The 
first step m its evolution is the stem cell 
the least dilTerentlated of the blood cells 
(Plate 4-4) This cell is also known as 
(he hemohistioblast of Ferrata 
Tlie nucleus is large in relation to the 
size of (he cell Its chromatin is delicate 
and homogeneous 2t contains one or more 
distinct nucleoli There may be a narrow 
h)alme clear perinuclear zone The nuclear 
membrane is indistinct The cytoplasm is a 
deeply blue narrow band 

The Waiuration of Erythrocytes. The stem 
cdls are at first morphologically identical 
but in the course of further development 
they give nse to all the other blood cells 
The stem cell which gives rise to erythrocytes 
differentiates into two series of cells the 
megaloblastic (the pnmltn'e or fetal tjTie) 
and the normoblastic (the adult type) 

The precursor of the megaloblastic senes 
is the promegaloblast (synonyms ery thro- 
gone embryonic rubnblast) Its nuclear 
chromatin is sbghtly coarser and its cyto 
plasm more basophilic than in the stem 
cell In the next phase the megaloblast 
varying amounts of hemoglobin are pres 
ent giving rise to polycliromatophilic (par 
tial hemoglobinization) or orthochromatic 
(complete hemoglobinization) megaloblasts 
The chromatin structure of the nucleus 
shows only moderate condensation The 
cytoplasm may contain occasional blue 
granules The megalocyte is the mature 
anuclear end stage of this senes 

The normoblastic senes begins with the 
pronormoblast (synonyms proerythroblast 
prorubncjte) Its nuclear chromatin is 




134 CLisrcAL Diacnosis b\ 

coarsely granular the cytoplasm is deeply 
basophilic The next step is progressne 
condensation of nuclear chromatin de 
crease of the size of the nucleus and pro- 
gressnely increasing production of hemo- 
globm This is the normoblast The changes 
in the nucleus and cytoplasm permit recog 
nition of early and late poljchromatophilic 
and ortbochromatic normoblasts In this 
stage a so called Howell Jolly body may be 
present — a small pyknotic mass of nuclear 
chromatin The erythrocyte is a normoblast 
minus the nucleus supravital stain bnngs 
out a network of dots and filaments in the 
polychromatophilic erythrocyte the reticulo 
cyte The final phase is the normocyte the 
orthochromatic normal mature erythrocyte 
completely de\oid of nuclear remnants not 
demonstrable even with supravital stains 

The Maturation of Granulocytes The 
stem cell gives nse to the myeloblast the 
mother cell of this series It is as a rule 
completely free of granules although a few 
bright red so-called azurophilic granules 
may be present The nucleus contains one 
or more nucleoli The maturation of the 
myeloblast proceeds along two parallel luies 
One line of progression invoUes the nu 
cleus the other involves a chemical reac 
bon that results in the formation of neutro- 
philic eosinophibc and basophilic gran 
ules 

The first stage is the transformation into 
a promyelocyte the largest of the senes 
wuth beginning condensation of the nuclear 
chromatin disappearance of the nucleoli 
and the appearance of a small number of 
cytoplasmic granules which are a mixture 
of azurophilic and of the specific granules 

In the second stage the myelocyte the 
nucleus is round or oval and the condensa 
lion of the nuclear chromatin is still farther 
advanced The cytoplasmic granules are 
fully developed and abundant so that they 
may obscure the outlme of the nucleus In 
the third stage the metamyelocyte the nu 
cleus becomes indented and kidney shaped 
its chromatin more clumped 

In the fourth stage the change to a 
band shaped nucleus is what gave it the 
name of the band or staff cell or rhabdo- 
cyie In the fifth stage the nucleus becomes 
segmented and the segments are connected 
with filaments of varying thickness With 
progressive maturation the number of seg 
ments increases The prognosuc imphca 
lions of the presence of immature granu 
locytes in the penpheral blood will be 
discussed later The preceding description 


Laboratorv Methods 

of the maturation of the neulrophiUc gran 
ulocytes applies to eosinophilic and baso- 
philic granulocytes but with a few minor 
deviations 

The eosinophibc segmented granulocytes 
rarely have more than two segments The 
granules are large bnght red and discrete 
in the mature cell but may be dark gray 
or purplish in the immature cell 

In the basophilic series the myelocyte 
has fewer granules than the corresponding 
neutrophilic or eosinophilic cell The baso- 
phibc granules are coarse and irregular in 
all the cells of this senes 

The Monocytic Senes The monoblast is 
the mother cell It is a large cell larger than 
the corresponding cells of the other two 
senes Nucleoli are prominent The cyto- 
plasm is finely granular and basophilic In 
the next stage the promonoevte the nu 
cleus tends to become indented the cyto 
plasm contains a small number of slightly 
azurophibc granules usually aggregated in 
the area of the nuclear indentation The 
mature monocyte is the largest white blood 
cell m the penpheral blood The indentation 
or lobation of the nucleus its finely rctic 
ulated ebromann structure and the dell 
cate diffuse granulation of the cytoplasm 
are charactenstic and consistent features 
of this cell 

The Maturation of Phtelets The mega 
karyoblasl the largest of the marrow cells 
is the mother cell of the platelet or thrombo- 
cyte It has distinct and prominent nucleoli 
the nuclear chromatin is dense and relicu 
lated and the cytoplasm is bluish gray 
occasionally with a deeper bluish unge a 
the periphery and a clear pennuclear zone 
In the next stage the promegakaryocyte flu 
nucleus becomes multilobulated the evto 
plasm increases m volume and granules a 
first azurophibc and later reddish purple 
appear In the mature megakaryocyte plate 
lets with eosinophibc granules appear thi 
cell becomes huge and irregularly shaped 
platelets can be seen to separate and cntci 
the peripheral circulation The platelets oi 
thrombocytes are fragments of megakaryo 
cytic cytoplasm They normally measure 2 u 
4 microns They consist of a rcfractile gran 
ular reddish purple chromomere or granu 
lomere and a homogeneous hyalomcrc 

The Maturation of the Lympliootc Th( 
lymphoblast is the mother cell of the lym 
phocytic series Its nuclear chromaun is 
somewhat coarse its nucleoli arc more dis 
tlnct but arc few, ustiallv not more ihar 
two and Its basoplulic cytoplasm is some 



Thf Blood 


what more abundant than the same ceD 
components m the myeloblast or monoblast 
The next stage the prolymphocyte occurs 
in two sizes the large and small Its chro- 
matin IS more densely clumped than is 
the case in the other blood cells at the same 
stage of de\elopment There is as a rule a 
simple but distmctly outlined nucleolus The 
cytoplasm is deeply blue and homogeneous 

The third stage the lymphocyte is seen 
m three sizes large intermediate or small 
The three differ not only in size as indi 
cated by the designation but m addition 
a disproportionately large amount of cyto 
plasm appears in the large lymphocyte a 
small number of azurophlhc granules ap 
pear m the cytoplasm of the intermediate 
lymphocyte (^so called mesolymphocyte) 
and a disproportionately small amount of 
cytoplasm and particularly dense and 
clumped chromatin appear in the small 
lymphocyte. 

The extreme umtanans believe that the 
lymphocyte is a mulupotential cell and that 
it may under certain abnormal circum 
stances become dedifferenuated to the stage 
of a stem cell and be capable of differen 
dating again mto any other blood cell 

The mother cell of the plasma cell is the 
plasmablasc (synonyms lymphoblastic 
plasma cell Turks imtation cell) The 
main difference between this cell and the 
more mature forms is the immaturity and 
lack of condensation of the nuclear chto 
matin Nucleoli may be present although 
frequently indistinct The cytoplasm is 
deeply blue homogeneous and de\oid of 
granules 

In the second stage the proplasmacyte 
IS as a rule a tissue cell and represents 
an intermediate phase in the de\eiopment 
toward the third and the most mature stage 
of this series the plasma cell or plasmacyte 
(synonym Marshalko cell) Its cytoplasm 
IS abundant and deeply blue its nucleus as 
a rule is eccentric and its nuclear chro- 
matin IS dense and clumped and frequently 
presents a so-called cartwheel arrangement 
The permucleai clear zone is sharp and 
distinct from the basophilic cytoplasm 

The Ongm of Plasma Cells They are 
thought to be derived from lymphocy'tes 
However it is possible or even probable that 
other cells of the blood or tissues and even 
fibroblasts may develop mto plasma cells 
Blood Formation 

Sites of Blootl Formation Undifferen 
tiaied cells of the mesenchyme and endo- 


thelial cells of the pniniiive blood spaces 
give rise to blood cells in the embryo Later 
in due course production of blood cdls 
becomes organoid and the liver and spleen 
become the mam sites Eventually the bone 
marrow takes over At birth the marrow is 
acme and red and contains only minimal 
amounts of fat Later m childhood only the 
proximal portions of the long bones and 
the flat bones (the skull vertebrae thoracic 
cage shoulder and pelvis) are the sues of 
blood formabon The rest of the marrow 
space IS occupied by fat which remains the 
reserve space for hfe It contains stem cells 
capable of rapid growth and reproduction 
when the need arises 

Production of Blood Cells Blood cells arc 
formed from preexisting cells Depending 
on the maturity of the cell at the time of 
multiplication the dinsion may be hetero- 
plastic when muhipotent mesenchymal cm 
bryonal cells are ^viding These cells are 
capable of giving nse to more than one cell 
form The division is homoplastic when a 
more differenbated cell gives nse by mitotic 
division to two cells of the same kind 

Cell Differentiation 
This means acquisition of functional 
properties which range from phagocytosis 
an example of a relatively primitive func 
tion to the production of complex proteins 
and of vanous structures essentia] for body 
economy 

Tissue Cells and Blood Cells 
The former arc fixed (eg fibrocytes and 
muscle cells) or are endowed with ability 
to move about as a rule in response to 
chemical sbmuh (e g fibroblasts and tissue 
leukocytes) Blood cells of the peripheral 
blood or hemocyies get into the circuhiion 
by being shed into circulabng blood or 
lymph in the growing marrow and lymphoid 
tissues (red cells and possibly lymphocytes) 
or by migrating into blood with the help 
of ameboid motion (granulocytes) 


There is much confusion concerning the 
nomenclature and classification of colls of 
the blood and bone marrow Every individ 
ual attempt to clanfy this situation seems 
only to lead to furUicr confusion In 1917 
a committee sponsored by the American 
Society of Clinical Pathologists and the 
(T«t 1* ContfnurJon p 142) 



Development of Wood ceUs Th« plate comprjses a suney of aU blood cells Tbe horizontal

normally in the peripheral blood The first of the two vertical double lines separates the 
Imi ^ exclusively in the marrow from the cells of the monoeyUc series The second serucal double 

-'"■"ri-'I*-? ™«n. 

1 The cells near the top of the plate have a characteristically basophilic cytoplasm, are free from 
granules, and have large, round, or sbghtly oval nuclei with a delicate chromatin structure (with the 
exception of the nucleus of the plasma cell in the left upper comer, which will he discussed in more detail 
later) As presented the primitive erythrocyte, the basophilic proerythroblast, the primitive Kranulocyte 
the myeloblast, and the young megakaryocyte, the megakaryoblast, originate directly from the prioiitne’ 
reticulum cell Blue nucleoli are seen in the nuclei of the proerythroblast, myeloblast and lymphoblast 

Certain changes take place mth progressive maturation of all Wood cells Some are common to all of 
them, some are different and specific for each type 

As one descends along the line of development from the top of the plate to the bottom, one secs 

The size of the whole cell and of the nucleus decreases in the erythroid, the granulocytic, and the 
lymphocytic senes The chromatin of the nucleus progressively loses its delicate granular structure and 
becomes more dense, more coarse and clumped The basophilia of the cytoplasm disappears completely in 
the cells onguiating in the marrow The cells of extramedullary origin behase differentlv Their cytoplasm 
remains basophilic but fecomes less deep in the lymphocyte, it actually becomes more intense in the 
plasma cells 

The result of the first transformatiQii of the reticulum cell Is a sixalled stem cell, a cell that has not 
declared its allegiance It is neither fish nor fowl Maybe that is why Jt was not included In this plate 
At any rate, in the course of differentiation this cell takes on specific charactenstics and becomes the 
proerythroblast, the myeloblast, the monoblast the megakaryohlast, and the lymphoblast, each the mother 
cell of a senes From this point on, specific changes take place in each series 

2 The en/throci/te Bcglnmng with the proerythroblast, the deep blue of the cytoplasm decreases some 
what the nucleus loses its granulation, and the nucleob vanish, the basophilic normoblast has appeared 
At first, small, mdistmctly purple patches of forming hemoglobin appear in the cytoplasm They become 
confluent and the whole ring of cytoplasm becomes a light purple the polychromatic normoblast As the 
amount of hemoglobm increases, so docs the pmk of the cytoplasm the orthochromauc normoblast 

As all this goes on in the cytoplasm, the nucleus shrinks and its chromatin contracts into a small, 
round, black clump and eventually ts thrown out of the cell, the erythrocyte has arrived The cell still 
contains a vestige of nuclear chromatin, the reticulum, invisible in smears stained with any of the usual 
Romanowsicy stains but recognizable by the larger size and the faint purplish gray color of (he polychro- 
matophilic erythrocyte la a smear vitally stained with cresyl Wue, for example, the nuclear remnant 
appears as a debcate blue network of fibnllae and dots, the reticulocyte At this stage tbe cell enters p^ 
npheral blood, the reticulum disappears progressively until the fully functional mature erythrocyte hat 
evolved 

3 The granulocule Again from the pnnutive reuculum cells, via tbe stem cell, the myeloblast has 
evolved 

AU these transitions are rapid and distinct when measured in days Actually they take place slowly when 
observed from minute to mmuie As we see them during (his progressive evolution, we cannot always dis 
cent the differences no more than we can set apart a two-year-old child from one two and one-half years 
old, but we can as a rule distinguish between a two- and a four year-old And so it is in the case of the five 
different blast cells At first we cannot tell them apart, even as we cannot note any differences in the stem 
cells In early stages of their embryonal life we have to resort to "judging a cell by the company It keeps " 

Now let us go back to (he changes takmg place m the granulocyte A most charactenstic innovation hu 
taken place Granules appear in the cytoplasm at first coarse and of indefinite color This together with 
the coarsening of the nuclear chromatin and the disappearance of the nucleob results in the promyelocyte 
According to tbe plate, a promyelocyte should not be classified as eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or basophilic 
.V r# jMtftf Aod zwithiof rise When the cUfferemlation onto the three colors— the red. the 

deep blue or the black and the in between the neutral — becomes clear cut, the next phase has developed 

the myelocyte the eosmophibe the basophibe and the neutrophilic cell The abundance of granules Is 

frequently so great that the structure and even the outlines of the nucleus are hazy, but Its round Cf 
shape and the progressive coarsening of its chromatin can be made out The bnUiant dazzling red of the 
discrete eosinophibc granules stands out and is maintained during the remainder of this cell s functional 
life Occasionally in poorly stained smears, the granules of the neutrophilic cell appear coarse and deeper 
red than they should The inexperienced may fall Into this trap and report eosinophilia where It does not 
exist Paying attention to the brilliancy and discreteness of true eosinophils protects against this mistake 

The basophilic myelocyte is just as dlsUnct m its appearance as is the eosinophilic In this ease the 
tendency to obscure the nucleus is even greater Tbe granules in the basophilic cells axe water soluble 
and when exposed to water the pigment disappears leaving a bunch of grape like vacuoles 

The changes in the cytoplasm of granulocytes reach their peak m tbe myelocyte Nothing of importance 
happens in the cytoplasm during the subsequent transformations It is the nucleus that changes ft becomes 
indented and kidney shaped and the metamyelocyte has developed The metamyelocyte Is the first « 
tbe series to break through the marrow blood barrier normally and then only as an occasional cell in tne 
next phase, the band form, the shape of the nucleus is just what the name impUes Finally, as the cell asM 
the band subdivides into segments connected with thin filaments— first two segments, then three, ana w 
on until the usual maximum of five segments is reached Presence of more than five segments is a **5” *>' 
advanced age polysegmentation, a shift to tbe right This progressive segmentation is cbaracleristlc tor 
the segmented neutrophilic granulocyte The eosinophilic and basophilic segment^ 
fewer segments than the neutrophil, as a rule only two segments rarely more Eventually, as^e roll 
the end of its useful life, it disintegrates It sweUs. ito outlines b^mc vague wd its ^ 

its granularity appears structurelros, the segments of the nucleus fall apart, and Ibcir chromatin congeais, 
as shown at the bottom of the plate Complete breakdown is the end

meeakaryoblast at the top in the third major vertical column is a giant of a cell with a restless nucleus and 
a homogeneous basophilic cytoplasm which very soon begins to show a fine granularity as the cell becomes 
the functioning megakaryocyte This cell is probably the largest normal cell of the body Its octopus hke

Interestingly this restless giant of a cell gives birth to the smallest fonned particle of the body the platelet

Amencan Medical Association undertook a 
complete reexamination of this subject The 
committee selected what its members be 
lie\ed to be the simplest clearest and most 
descnptne terms for the \arious cell forms 
In addmon they tried to achieie consistency 
betiveen related terms and suggested the 
elimination of many synonymous terms and 
eponyms (Committee report 1949 1950) 
At the present time however the suggested 
changes m termmology have not been gen 
orally accepted by climcal pathologists and 
with few exceptions no significant change 
in usage is noted in current texts and medi 
cal literature For this reason vve feel that 
It would be unwise to burden the reader 
with a more detailed consideration of the 
matter Since no theory of hematopoiesis 
has been firmlv established and since the 
maturation of the cells is a continuous 
process yielding an infinity of transitional 
forms the student must be prepared to 
resolve a certain amount of confusion £n 
terminology In actual practice the situa 
tion IS not nearly so difficult as it seems 
For ordinary clinical purposes reports ac 
cording to any of the various systems are 
equally well interpreted provided the terms 
used are clearly defined 

EXAMINVTION OF MXRROW 

Marrow aspirauon biopsy introduced by 
Arinkin in 1929 was considered at first a 
formidable and highly speciabzed pro- 
cedure It is now widely used in the diag 
nosis of hematologic diseases and many 
conditions not primarily affecting the blood 
system A number of techniques have been 
devised by which a suitable specimen of 
marrow can be obtained with little discom 
fort to the patient The simple aspirauon 
type of biopsy can be earned out as an office 
procedure on ambulatory patients The risks 
mvohed are mimmal They compare favor 
ably with ordinary vempuncture and are 
decidely less traumatizing than a lumbar 
puncture As for any other special pro- 
cedure however the indicauons for mar 
row exammation should be clear In each 
mstance the physician should have in mind 
some reasonable prediction of its result and 
consequent benefit to the patient Without 
exception the penpheral blood should be 
exammed carefully first It is a relaUvdy 
uncommon circumstance to find hemato- 
logic disease m the bone marrow either 
earber or more certainly than it can be dis 
covered in the peripheral blood If an ex 


aminer is not able toind at least suggesUve 
evidence of an abnormabty referable to the 
marrow from the cbmeal data or the study 
of the peripheral blood he is not likely to 
do better with the marrow 

It IS estimated that the w-eight of the 
marrow m man varies from 1300 to 1500 
gm The unique feature of this organ is its 
extreme lability It can undergo complete 
transformaUon in a few days and occasion 
ally ev en m a few hours This rapid trans- 
formation involves as a rule the whole 
organ as evidenced by the fact that a small 
sample represented by a biopsy or aspira 
Oon IS usually fairly representative of the 
whole marrow This conclusion is m ac 
cord with results of studies of biopsy sam 
pies simultaneously removed from several 
sues According to these observations the 
various sites chosen for removal of marrow 
for studies are in most instances equally 
good Consequently the difficulty of access 
the risks mvolved and the discomfort of the 
patient are the mam reasons for selection 
of a sue in the particular patient Occasion 
ally the failure to obtain quantitatively or 
quabtatively adequate material in one site 
may be followed by success in another 
location Also the need for repeated aspira 
tions or biopsies may indicate the use of 
several different sites The iliac bone and 
the vertebral spinous processes are less 
traumauc to the patient and seem to be 
more promising as sources of marrow for 
demonstration of cancer cells On the other 
hand the iliac marrow frequently shows 
quantitative differences namely a greater 
admixture of penpheral blood including 
lymphocytes and mature granulocytes and 
a lower myeloid-erythroirf (M E) ratio 
Quabtative differences are less marked 

Techtiiqiie of Mnrrou Aiptralioit Biopsy 

In the adult patient the sternum the 
spinous processes of the vertebrae and the 
ilijc^crest are readily accessible areas from 
which bone marrow matenal can be ob- 
tamed In infants and young children the 
upper end of the tibia is frequently used to 
obtain marrow The various methods of ob 
taimng and handbng matenal are essen 
tially identical in pnnciple so that com 
parable results are achieved by workers of 
equal skill and expenence 

Surgical biopsy of the marrow in which 
mtact fragments of tissue are obtained by 
incision or by trephmmg at one ume had 
many advocates These procedures have 



Tiir Rlooi> 


now been largely replaced by aspimtion 
technique, which has the ad\antage of sim 
phciiy and less discomfort to the paoent 
The preparation of marrow fragments for 
histologic examination in sections js tedious 
and lime consuming Also the stained sec- 
tions are not so suitable for accurate dif- 
ferentiation of cell types as arc the smeared 
preparations Surgical biops) may be used 
nhen it Is important to see the cells in their 
anatomic re/ation to one another and to the 
inactive fat or connective tissue stroma (as 
in aplastic anemia and mjelofibrosis) or in 
diseases that produce focal rather than dif- 
fuse changes (Hodgkins disease, multiple 
mjeloftia raetastatre or pnmarj malignant 
diseases of bone, and so on) ffowever, 
aspiration should be tried first because each 
of the lesions listed in the preceding sen 
tence mav be demonstrated h^ means of an 
aspiration 

Aspirated marrow may be handled m 
several different ways Some workers pre- 
fer to pick out visible particles from the 
specimen waih or without hopann. and 
stain these on slides Others make films on 
slides using small drops of the whole ma 
tonal withdrawn Satifacioty results can be 
had either way, but particles (essentially 
fragments of marrow tissue) should be 
utilized whene'er they are available Some 
additional experience is required for the 
selection and staining of fragments but the 
preparations usually have a higher technical 
quality and the distribution of ceils is more 
reliable 

Tlie technique to be outlined here Is 
known to yield good film** and to show 
reasonably smooth distribution of cells, and 
it can be earned out with a minimum of 
technical complexity

Is usuall> combined vnih the study of 
smears or of histolopc sections The as- 
pirate IS transferred to a Wintrobe hemato- 
crit tube mth a capillary pipet Some or all 
of the \asible particles are mcluded, de 
pending on their use for preparation of 
direct smears The tube is centrifuged at 
high speed (±: 2500 rpm ) for ten min 
utes Four layers can be distinguished in 
the centrifugate fat. plasma myeloid 
erythroid (ME) portion, and erythrocytes 
Their height is recorded in percentages by 
reading on the scale of the tube Normally 
the fat layer is I to 3 per cent of the total 
%o]uine and the M E layer 5 to 8 per cent 
The volumes of the plasma and erythrocyte 
layers vary considerably The erythrocyte 
volume IS generally more than the bemalo- 
cnt because of shorter centrifugation The 
admixture of sinusoidal blood not an un 
common occurrence in marrow aspiration, 
may alter the proportions of the different 
fractions more or less significantly 

lulerbrelalion of quanlilnlne fnuhngs 
High myeloid-erythroid and low fat values, 
in the absence of a significant penpheral 
ieu^QO tos i5. suggest marrow hyperplasia, 
at least local Low mjeloid-erytliroid and 
high fat values suggest hypoplasia, at least 
of the aspirated sample If the myeloid 
erythroid layer rs less than 2 per cent and 
fat is absent, the sample is mainly sum 
soidal blood Examination of histologic sec 
uons is an essential check on the quantita- 
tive data Concentraaon by centrifugation 
is particularly valuable in group studies 
but m the study of individual paaents the 
use of parades and of histologic prepara 
tions IS more advantageous Dilution with 
smusoidal blood may amount to 40 to 100 
per cent in aspirates as small as 0 25 to 
0 5 ml Consequently it was suggested to 
use the term hemomyelogram for a differ 
eniial count of marrow aspirates and to 
restrict the term “myelogram" to counts 
from which mature granulocytes have been 
excluded (Pontoni 1936) 

Histologic Sections Tlie fragments ob- 
tained by surgical biopsy or trephine the

tore, and quantitative data in addition 
However, the histologic section method is 
definitely inferior for the study of cyto- 
logic details Another disadvantage is that 
particles adequate for histologic sections 
are not always obtamed, especially m 
condjuons zn which the diagnosis depends 
on marrow evidence, eg. myelofibrosis or 
metastatic cancer 

Berman (1953) recommended the follow 
mg techmque The aspurated manow is de- 
posited in a paraffin-coated vual A small 
amount of powdered topical thrombin is 
placed on a clean glass slide, dissolved m a 
drop of water, and allowed to dry The mar 
row particles in the aspirate tend to stick 
to the paraffin coating They are transferred 
with the broken end of a wooden appbeator 
and placed close to each other on the throw 
bm-coated area on the slide A few drops of 
heparinized plasma from the centrifuged 
aspirate are added The plasma clots by 
action of thrombm The marrow parucles 
are included m the dot, which is trans 
feixed 10 a suitable fixative The latter is 
changed repeatedly until it remains water 
clear and then run through, embedded sec 
tioned, and stained 

The SitTgteal Biopsy 

The indications for surgical biopsy are 
dry tap, myelofibrosis, osteosclerosis and 
metastauc cancer Smears touch prepara 
bons and pieces of bone and marrow can 
be obtained in adequate amounts Any lo- 
cabon can be used but the disadv antage of 
the sternum is that it may leave a conspicu

L\amiyiatto>i of Marron rj/i«5 

The ability to interpret marrow cytology 
can be attamed only by experience It must 
be regarded more as a qualitative examina 
tion than as a quantitative test For this 
reason the exammer should be informed 
of the clinical nature of the patients dis 
ease 

In general there are two ways in which 
a marrow film can be examined First by 
scanning several sbdes under low then 
high dry and finally under oil Immersion 
magmfication and on the basis of previous 
experience one can arrive at impressions 
concerning the number and distribution of 
cells in very much the same manner as 
the pathologist reads his sections of tissue 
Second one can actually make a differen 
tial count of large number of cells (300 to 
1000) and calculate the percentage of each 
type of cell Finally a combination of both 
methods can be used 

The second of these methods painstaking 
differential counting is an essential part of 
training in this work without which ac 
curacy m the first method may never be 
had The diflerential count also affords an 
objective record from which future changes 
may be measured The recognition of cell 
types and particularly recognition of the 
maturation phase within any given scries 
tends to vary rather widely from one lab- 
oratory to another despite a great many 
efforts to standardize nomenclature with 
descriptions photographs and drawings 
No average normals or even ranges of nor 
mal can be accepted as universal The most 
valid base hne is that determined in each 
individual laboratory and even then un 
less “group training Is used there may be 
significant variations from one examiner 
to another Fortunately these limitations of 
the method are senous only when tliey arc 
not recognized By practice and expcnence 
laboratory vvorkers are able to obtain graii 
lying practical results and establish a high 
degree of reproducibility in their marrow 


117 

differential counts The following procedure 
for the studies of marrow preparations can 
be recommended 

1 Naked eye inspection of the slides to 
select the smear containing particles 

2 Low power (IG mm ) survey of the 
particles to fonn a preliminary opinion 
whether the marrow is normoplastic hypo- 
plastic or hy^perplasiic 

3 Selection of a cellular area usually in 
the tail portion of the film around the par 
tides IS followed by high power and oiJ 
immersion study of cytologic details 

The following points are particularly sig 
nificant 

CELLULARm 

The degree of cellulanty or whether the 
marrow Is generally hyperplastic or hypo 
plastic is a difficult point to determine by 
examination of aspirated material When this 
issue is crucial we can be certain only bv 
the study of histologic sections of matenal 
obtained by surgical biopsy If aspiration is 
earned out m a uniform manner and if 
minimal amounts of matenal are with 
drawn it is possible to make useful al 
though rather crude estimntes of cellu 
lanty 

The report should include references to 
the following description of the general 
cellulanty type of eryihropoiesis general 
maturity of the erythropoietic and Icuko* 
poictic cells and an esumate of the M E 
or L E ratio based on a count of 500 to 
1000 cells 

A differential count is useful but only in 
special cases for example in leukemia to 
follow up the effect of therapy Examination 
of more slides in the time that would other 
wise be spent for differential counts is more 
fruitful 

MyELOiD-ERXTHRoiD (M E) Ratio 

In the normal adult the M E ratio is 
about 3 or 4 to 1 This widely used term 
refers to differential counts from which 
mature granulocytes have not been ex 
eluded Tlie term “Icukoeryilirogenetic 
(L E) ratio refers to counts from which 
mature granulocytes have been excluded 
The latter is a better expression of the rcli 
live proportions of leiikopofcsls to cry thro 
pofesis (Pontoni 193G) 

The M E ratio at birth is 1 85 to 3 It 
nses rapidly soon afterward and during 
the first two weeks of life it reaches tlic 
highest normal level of 11 to 1 It then 
gradually drops to the 1 to-20ycar nveragt 
of 3 to 1

Clinical Diagnosis b\ 

Interpretation An increased M E ratio 
1 e 6 to 1 may mean a reaction to an 
infecuon or may mean leukemia a leu 
kemoid reaction or erythroid hypoplasia A 
decreased M E ratio i e less than 2 to 1 
may mean a depression of leukopoiesis or a 
hyperplasia of erythropoiesis Normoblastic 
erythroid hyperplasia may be the result of 
one of the many forms of anemia or of 
hver diseases or polycythemia Megalo 
blastic erythroid hyperplasia may be caused 
by a deficiency of a red cell maturing factor 
as in permcious anemia A normal M E 
ratio does not necessarily mean normal 
marrow 

Due to the irregular distnbution of the 
various cell types differential counts of nu 
cleated marrow cells are not more than ap 
proximations The irregularity is partly 
caused by the tendency of mature neutro- 
phdic granulocytes and platelets to aggre 
gate A low pouer survey of the entire 
smear gives the expenenced exammer a 
much more accurate picture of the relative 
proportions of the cells than a differential 
count An estimate expressed as increased 
normal or reduced cellulanty is all that is 
necessary for practical purposes 

One soon learns to note with some ac 
curacy the expected 20 or 25 per cent of 
nucleated cells m the erythrocytic senes 
without the necessity of making actual 
counts A diminished proportion of nu 
cleated red cells usually signifies bone mar 
row suppression or displacement by leu 
kemic or other mahgnant cells An increased 
number of nucleated red cells usually seen 
m a generally hyperplastic marrow char 
actenzes the iron deficiency and hemolytic 
anemias m which normoblasts predominate 
and the macrocytic anemias in which eryth 
roblasts megaloblasts or permcious ane 
mia type cells predominate 

The “Normal* Marrow Differential The 
data available in the literature for so called 
“normal” marrow cell counts vary from in 
vestigator to investigator One misses the 
generally accepted normals for the pe 
npheral blood The \anous “normal” differ 
entials reflect the particular investigators 
techmque of countmg and manner of in 
terpretation Therefore it is best to estab- 
lish ones own normals Our own collected 
observations are recorded m our table of 
normals (Table 4-2)

/Megakaryocytes 

Because of their large size and unique 
appearance these cells are readily recog 
nized under low magnification Since they 
tend to accumulate at the edges or thick end 
of the smear it is best to look for them 
first at low magnification before proceedmg 
to a more detailed study under the oil fan 
mersion lens Attempts at actual counting 
of megakaryocytes are usually disappoint 
ing and even sifter examining several films 
one IS usually sausfied to state that mega 
karyocytes appear to be present in normal 
numbers or that they are absent In direct 
smears made from aspirated marrow the 
distnbution of megakaryocytes is so unpre 
dictable that tbeir absence should excite 
little concern unless associated with throm 
bocytopemc purpura Smears of selected 
marrow fragments are more reliable for this 
observ ation In idiopathic thxombocytopemc 
purpura megakaryocytes are usuall> pres 
cnt in normal or even in mcreased num 
bers Qualitative changes in their appear 
ance should be noted although they are 
difficult to evaluate It has been recom 
mended that not less than 25 megakaryo- 
cytes be examined for such a study Morpho- 
logic ev-idence of immatunty diminished or 
absent cytoplasmic granulation vacuohza 
tion or hyahnization of the cytoplasm and 
absence of peripheral fragmentation or 
“platelet production have been noted by 
various observers m the study of thrombo- 
cytopemc disorders 

Distribution of Cell Types 

In overt disease of the blood system an 
abnormal distribution of cells is often im 
mediately evident upon scanning the mar 
row smear This may be true m the aleu 
kemic leukemias when the diagnosis is 
difficult or impossible by examination of 
peripheral blood so that this group of dis

certain cases of chrome granuloc>tic leu

ful study perhaps including di^erential 
counts may be necessary to indicate the

not rare to find other types of malignant

In the differential diagnosis of macrocytic 
anemia there are some cases in which the 
peripheral blood picture suggests permcious 
anemia and the examination of marrow 
may show normoblastic and not megalo* 
blastic regeneration of erythrocytes In such 
instances the examination of the marrow 
may be the only means of recognizing the 
true nature of the condition 
In a variety of conditions such as he 
molytic aplastic and regenerative anemias 
leukopema thrombocytopenic purpura mul 
tiple myeloma metastatic carcinoma lipoid 
storage diseases myeloproliferative disease 
splenomegaly lymph node eniaigements in 
vanous sMn lesions and in other situations 
marrow examination may help to the cor 
rect diagnosis or may exclude a pnmary 
disease of the blood 

In obscure fevers and suspected infec 
tjons in which blood cultures vere negauve 
culture of marrow aspirate may show

Examination of marrow is essential for 
correct diagnosis of pancytopema It may 
help to diagnose or rule out leukemia

Laboratori Methods 

Examination of histologic sections pre 
pared from particles of marrow may be 
helpful in the recognition and diagnosis of 
neoplastic and granulomatous lesions of 
marrow such as malignant l>Tnphorm 
iretastatic carcinoma multiple myeloma 
sarcoidosis tuberculosis brucellosis and 
histoplasmosis and of storage diseases e g 
Gaucher s This method also permits one to 
study the architecture of marrow that is 
essential for the diagnosis of aplastic anc 
nua and myelofibrosis and may not be dein 
onstrated with the smear method It is in 
most of the conditions listed in this para 
graph that dry taps are common In such 
cases surgical biopsy may furnish suitable 
material In expenenced hands a dry tap" 
or a film showing only pcnpheral blood is 
a significant finding and should arouse sus 
picion of bone marrow aplasia replacement 
by malignant tissue myelosclerosis or simi

Contraindications Hemophilia and other 
major disturbances of coagulation hver or 
equivalent therapy including blood trans 
fusion during the preceding three weeks 
and patients suspected of having pernicious 
anemia

Complications may occur during aspira 
tion One should be prepared to administer 
intravenously a short acting barbiturate 
from ready to use stenle ampules If the pa 
tient develops convulsions 

Death has been reported from puncture 
of the heart and tamponade Caution is es 
sential Indications for the procedure should 
be observed Neophytes should be carefully 
trained and closely supervised The use of 
sites other than the sternum should be cn 
couraged whenever possible 

Study of Marrow Obtained ot iutojiry 

Samples of marrow should be obtiined at 
every autopsy but to secure useful material 
It has to be removed within two hours after 
death Tissue from the following 
should be obtained a segment of a rib and 
sternum a wedge of a lumbar vertebral 
body and a segment of marrow removed 
from the midfemur The femoral marrovv 
is particularly useful as an indicator of 
response of the marrovv to hematopoietic 
stimuli whereas the rib sternum and ver 
tebra which contain red marrow at all agM 
are sensitive indicators of damage of van 
ous kinds

Sfircial Dinguostic Stain 

Iron stain Is useful for differentiation of 
anemias due to iron deficiency and blood 
loss from anemia of thalassemia and of 
pjTidoxine deficiency in which iron is poorly 
utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. 
Hemosiderin Stain 
Potassium ferrocy anide 4 fm. 

Distilled tvatcr 20 ml. 

Add concentrated HCl until a white pre* 
cipitate forms. Filter. Cover the marrow 
smear with filtrate for 30 minutes. Result: 
hemosiderin is blue, iron in ferritin and 
hemoglobin is not stained. Report as nega- 
tive or 14- to 4-f-. Marrow hemosiderin is 
comparable to hemosiderin in rest of body. 

Inicrprciation. In iron deficiency the re- 
sult is negative. In unstained preparations 
hemosiderin appears as yellow, refractile 
granules. Normally a small number of blue 
granules arc seen. None or extremely rare 
hemosiderin granules are seen in iron de. 
ficicncy states. They are numerous in In- 
fections, pernicious anemia, hemolytic ane- 
mia, hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, 
hepatic cirrhosis, uremia, and cancer and 
after repeated transfusions. 

•>^'ITAL STAINING 
Vital Staining of Erythrocytes 

On the assumption that ordinary stain- 
ing of dried and fixed blood films shows 
the reactions of dead corpuscles and does 
not necessarily indicate the condition of the 
living corpuscles, attempts have been made 
to stain blood corpuscles in the living state. 
The information yielded by this so-called 
vital or supravital staining has to do chiefly 
with certain reticulated erythrocytes, which 
contain a coarse skein or network of gran- 
ular filaments. Sometimes, apparently de- 
pending on variations in technique of stain- 
ing, there are no definite filaments but only 
a number of discrete, coarse granules scat- 
tered inegularly through the corpuscle. The 
granulofilamentous substance stains sharply 
«ith many of the basic dyes when these arc 
applied to the living corpuscles but com- 
pletely fails to stain films dried in the usual 
manner. 

As to the nature of the reticulum, little 
is kno^vn definitely. Some workers connect 
it with polychromatophilia and others with 
mitochondria. In any case, reticulation is 
apparently a characteristic of very young 
erythrocytes, and the number of reticulated 
erythrocytes in the circulating blood is prob- 


ably the best available Index of the activity 
of regeneration of blood. An increase may 
be interpreted as indicating both an exces- 
sive demand for new erythrocytes and a 
competent bone marrow; when the demand 
lessens or the hone marrow fails to func- 
tion. the number of reticulated erythrocytes 
decreases. 

In healthy medical students, for example, 
the reticulated erythrocytes comprise 0.3 to 
J per cent (usually 0.6 to 0.8 per cent) of 
all the erythrocytes. In young infants, the 
percentage is t%vo to four times as high as 
It is in medical students. Some writers give 
higher figures, that is, 0.5 to 2 per cent for 
adults and 5 to 10 per cent for infants In 
the r'arious types of anemia associated with 
increased activity of the bone marroiv. the 
percentage of reticulated erythrocytes 
ranges from 2 to 20 or even higher, the 
percentage running parallel with the vary- 
ing activity of regeneration of blood and 
bearing no necessary relation to the eryth- 
rocyte count. The percentage is notably high 
in hemolytic jaundice 

Of the various dyes that have been used 
for vital staining, brnijant_^syljilue ap- 
pears to be by far the most’saiisfactory. 

The following method is very satisfactory 
for staining reticulocytes. Make a saturated 
solution of bnlbant cresyl blue by placing 
a very small amount of dye in the bottom 
of a small tube (Wassermann tube) and 
adding distilled water to dissolve as much 
of the dye as possible. If the American- 
made dye is used, better results may be 
obtained if the dye is dissolved in 0.9 per 
cent solution of sodium chloride. Place a 
drop of the patient’s blood on one end of a 
clean slide as in making an ordinary blood 
film. Place beside it a drop of the solution 
of cresyl blue, using a glass rod. Wipe off 
the excess stain from the glass rod, mix 
the blood, and the stain thoroughly. The 
mixture will be a light green color. Then 
spread the blood in the usual manner, as 
illustrated in Figure 4-23, and stain tvith 
Wright’s stain. The reticulocytes will have 
the appearance shmvn in Figure 4-47 and 
Plate 4-3 [5]. A differential count then may 
be made. 

Examine the stained film 'vith an oil im- 
mersion objective and calculate what pro- 
portion of the erythrocytes contains reticu- 
lum or granules. As a basis for calculation, 
at least 1000 erythrocytes (preferably 3000) 
should be e.xamined for reticulation. These 
should be examined on several different por- 
ti<ms the slide. To obviate the difficulty

Vital Stammg of Leukocytes 
Florence Sabm has introduced a simple 
method for studying the leukocytes in the 
Innig conditions This method opens a new 
and fertile field for research and also prom 
ises to become a useful clinical procedure 
For a detailed description of this method 
the reader is referred to the papers of Sabin 
and her coworkers (Cunningham et al

A similar method has long been used for 
ntal stammg of erythrocytes but the con

The result of hematologic examinations 
forming what we call the "blood picture*' is 
an essential part of the clinical description 
of practically every disease A normal num 
lier and distribution of cells and a normal 
licmoglobin concentration in llic blood arc 
so important as physiologic constants that 
the absence of disease can scarcely be as 
serted until these observations have been 
made *11131 certain diseases do not produce 
significant changes in the blood is often a 
valuable point in differential diagnosis 
Most hematologic changes are the result of 


pathologic processes not primarily affectmg 
the blood or blood forming tissues The 
granulocytosis of acute suppurative dis 
eases the anemia of bleeding peptic ulcer 
the lymphocytosis of whooping cough and 
many other "blood pictures” constitute im 
portant diagnostic information in each m 
stance forming an essential part of the 
clinical description of the particular disease 
It is evident therefore that cbnical he

By far less common are some of the so

of this group We also recognize a group of 
diseases which although not primarily in

spicuous changes in the blood picture that 
this feature becomes the key to diagnosis 
and treatment Toxic or allergic agranii 
locytosis nutritional anemia and certain 
forms of aplastic anemia are suitable ex

of cbnical hematology is generally defined 
to include the hemorrhagic diseases or those 
conditions in which there is disturbance of 
the blood-clottmg mechanism All these diva

Types of HemntotoQic Examination 

Some hazard is involved in adopung a 
routine or set of routines for laboratory 
orders since the problem of each patient 
must be given individual consideration 
However certain tests are used so fre 
quentl) that time and effort can be saved 
by putting them into groups as indicated in 
the following paragraphs 

Routine or Screening txammations it is 
generally considered a wise policy to include 
a few hematologic procedures in the ex 
amination of every patient without relation 
to any known or suspected diagnosis The 
procedures are selected with reference to the 
rnosl common diseases and abnotmaliUcs 
Their chief purpose is to Indicate whether or 
not more detailed examinations arc needed

numbers of patients and often it is also 
important that they be simple and eco-

•^HE ANEMUS 

Definition Anemia Is i disease character 
ized by a reduction of the O-carrymg sub- 
stance in a certain volume of blood due to 
r^uciion below normal in the number oi 
red blood cells per cubic millimcur in be- 
moglobin per 100 ml of blood and In Ih'j 
volume of packed red cells per 100 ml of 


Tun Biood 


blood For practical purposes 12 gm of 
hemoglobin nnj be accepted as the di\id 
ing line Values belou it indicate anemia 

Tlic loss of hemoglobin and consequent 
reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity 
of the blood is the most conspicuous fea 
ture of anemia and Is the pathologic basis 
for most of the associated signs and symp- 
toms such as dyspnea tachycardia weak 
ness and so on Anemia aiithout the addl 
tion of a qualifying or descriptiic term Is 
not a satisfactory diagnosis and neier a 
valid basis for treatment In the majorii) 
of instances anemia occurs as a sign or 
complication of disease often remote from 
the blood system itself When anemia is 
encountered a careful reevalualion of the 
patients condition and a search for the 
underlying cause are demanded 

Devflopmint of the Ehythrocyte 

It takes only one to two days for the 
proerythroblast the cells just one step away 
from the undifferentiated mulupoientlal 
stem cell to pass through the stages of the 
early and late erythroblast and to mature 
Into the normoblast the cells with the dense 
homogeneous nucleus The transformation 
Is accomplished by enzymes utilizing met 
abolic substrates The morphologic expres 
Sion of the maturation is (he appearance of 
hemoglobin molecules nhich are hrst de 
monstrablc in early erythroblasts but only 
spcctrophotomctrically and visually in late 
erythroblasts (Thorell 1947) The Increase 
of hemoglobin goes on at the expense of 
nbonuclcic acid 

The next steps which take another day 
include expulsion of the nucleus trans 
fonnation wto the reticulocyte entrance 
Into the circulating blood and maturation 
into the fully developed red blood cell all 
of which takes i«o to four days and is ac 
compamed by cxliaustion of the ribonucleic 
acid The period of useful function of the 
red cell m the circulating blood is 80 to 
100 days Agmg is associated with the pro 
gressive loss or deterioration of enzymes 

The most important metabolic change at 
the end of the red cell s life is release of 
Iron and of the other metabolites About 1 
mg of iron and 10 mg of bilirubin are 
released into the circulation when 1 ml 
of erythrocytes is destroyed (Crosby 1957) 
The mature functioning erythrocyte has a 
lipoprotein stroma which encloses from 200 
to 300 million hemoglobin molecules Its 
energy source is anaerobic glycolysis For 
its physiologic function of oxygen transport 


155 

by hemoglobin the erytlirocyte needs a sys 
tern of enzymes One of them carbonic 
anliydrase is needed for the transport of 
carbon dioxide from the Ussues to the lungs 
(Gabno et al 1056 Gramck 1949) As 
reduced hemoglobin is exposed m the lungs 
to oxygen at increasing pressures mcreas 
ing amounts of oxygen are taken up until 
each molecule of hemoglobin has bound 
four molecules of oxygen Tlie final product 
saturated oxyhemoglobin contains 1 34 ml 
of oxygen per gram of hemoglobin 

The release of oxygen in tlie tissues de 
pends on the hydrogen ion concentration 
In acme tissues with a high hydrogen ion 
concentration and a more acid pH more 
oxygen is released than m resting tissues 
with a low hydrogen ion concentration and 
more alkaline pH 

The CO is carried by the red cells mainly 
as bicarbonate only small amounts are ab- 
sorbed physically and earned as unchanged 
CO The transformation of CO to bicar 
bonatc m the tissues and its release as CO 
from bicarbonate in the lungs is mediated 
by the enzyme carbonic anhydrasc 
The Hemopoietic Equilibrium Normally 
the red cell count and hemoglobin levels 
are mamtamed tenaciously They ate the 
result of a balance between red cell de- 
siniction and production Red cell produc 
Uon is controlled by and is inversely pro 
ponionate to the oxidative tissue metab 
ohsm 

77ic normal daily output of red cells by 
marrow is 20 ml of packed cells (Crosby 
1958) The production is increased when 
oxygen supply to the tissues drops as in 
anemia at high altitudes and when oxygen 
exchange in the lungs is impaired by pul 
inonary and cardiovascular diseases The 
production drops with increase of oxygen 
transport to the tissues as in experimental 
polycythemia produced by transfusions of 
blood or as a result of exposure to high 
atmospheric oxygen pressure 
Erythropoietin 

Dermition Erythropoietin Is a substance 
in the plasma of anemic animals plasma of 
animals exposed to low oxygen pressure 
and plasma and urine of some anemic pa 
tients capable of stimulating red cell pro- 
duction in normal animals (Gurney et al 
1957 Sacks I9S8 Stohlman and Brecher 
1957) 

Factors Which Determine the

Hie formation and destruction of erytb

rocytes and hemoglobin are continuous 
processes m the body The composition of 
peripheral blood reflects the existing bal 
ance between these two mechanisms In 
health, a balance is maintained such that 
the number of erythrocytes and concentra 
tion of hemoglobm remain at a remarkably 
constant le\el \Vhen the balance is upset 
by deficient formation of blood on the one 
hand or by excessive destruction or actual 
loss of blood on the other, the result is 
anemia In many cases it is possible to de 
termine which phase of the balanced mech 
anism is at fault and in this manner to ap 
proach the true etiologic basis of the ane 
mia Thus an excessive destruction of red 
cells IS characterized by an increase in the 
excretion of urobilinogen (both urine and 
feces), elevated serum bilirubm increase in 
the number of reticulocytes leukocytosis 
and other evidences of reactive hyperplasia 
of the bone marrow Decrease in the forma 
tion of red cells is characterized by disap 
pearance of reticulocytes decrease in the 
excretion of urobilinogen and often by leu 
kopenia and other signs of inacuvity of the 
hematopoietic tissues 
In addition to simple diminution in the 
concentration of hemoglobm and of the 
erythrocyte count m anemia certain quail 
tatne changes appear and may be marked 
in the cases in which anemia is severe In 
general these are an expression of strain 
put on the erythropoietic mairow which 
tends to react excessively and sometimes in 
an abnormal manner It may produce and 
release into the arculation a variable num 
ber of immature and imperfect erythrocytes 
(such as poikilocytes polychromatophilic 
cells and nucleated erythrocytes) In some 
types of anemia the regeneration of blood 
takes on some of the characteristics seen in 
fetal life and immature red cells appear in 
great numbers in the marrow and even pass 
over mto the circulating blood 

Clinical Signs of Anemia 
Certain clinical signs and symptoms arc 
directly associated with anemia per sc and 
are more^or less Independent of the par 
ticular cause For the most part these signs 
and symptoms are due to the diminished 
o\y gen-carrying capacity of the blood and 
therefore are roughly proportionate to the 
hemoglobin concentration It is not possible 
to state a critical level beyond which the 
vital processes arc deranged since there arc 
always a number of factors operating at

(Wintrobe 1961) The morphologic char 
actcnstics are only minimal anisocjtosis 
pwilkilocy tosis and achromia regardless of 
the seventy of the anemia If a marked 
degree of these morphologic variations and 
normal corpuscular indexes are present to- 
gether, a technical error in the latter or 
combined deficiencies of vitamin Bi* or 
folic acid and of iron may be tlie explan i 
tion Macrocyiosis due to vitamin Bi- or 
folic acid deficiency and microevtosis due 
to iron deficiency may cancel each other out 
and normocytic anemia Is the result (see 
Table 4-3)

The classification of hemolytic anemias is 
based on the location of the factor responsi 
ble for the hemolysis Those within the 
erythrocyte the corpuscular defects are as 
a rule hereditary The extracorpuscular 
factors are as a rule acquired The differ 
ence between the two is best demonstrated 
by survival studies of the red cells When 
erythrocytes with a corpuscular defect are 
transfused into a normal recipient their 
survival is about as long as it is m (he 
original host and shorter than the sunival 
of the recipients red cells Normal ted cells 
transfused to patients with defective eryth 
rocytes survive normally Red cells of 
patients with an extracorpuscular defect 
survive in a normal recipient as long as 
his own red cells On the other hand normal 
erythrocytes transfused to patients with cx 
tracorpuscular defects survive only about 
as long as the recipient s own red cells 

Laboratory Findings in Hemolytic 
Anemia 

They differ depending on the amount of 
destroyed blood and the rate of destruction 
If the destruction is rapid and the quantity 
of destroyed blood is large free hemoglobin 
and metbemalbumin will be present in the 
plasma (hemoglobinemla Tnd methemal 
buminemia) The unne will show albumin 
and granular and red cell casts and may 
also show hemosiderin 

According to recent studies hemoglobi 
nuna depends upon the action of hapto- 
globin a hemoglobin binding globulin The 
hemoglobin haptoglobin complex is removed 
from the circulation and catabohzed by the 
reticulocndothehal system (Laurell and 
NyTnan 1957) Tills process prevents hemo 
globin from appearing in the urine How 
ever under certain circumstances the 


hemoglobin haptoglobin reaction does not 
operate This happens when the plasma 
hemoglobin level exceeds 100 to 130 mg 
per 100 ml or when the plasma haptoglobin 
has been used up Then the plasma hemo- 
globin passes into the unne and hemo 
globinuna results In the renal tubules a 
part of the hemoglobin is broken down The 
iron IS eliminated m the urme as hemo 
siderin The remaining hemoglobin may be 
oxidized and eliminated as methemoglobin 
The normal plasma hemoglobin level is 2 
to 3 mg per 100 ml A rise to 5 to 10 mg 
imparts to the plasma a yellow to orange 
color With further increase the color be 
comes pink Levels up to 25 to 30 mg per 
100 ml are common in hemolytic anemia 
Higher levels are usually indicative of intra 
vascular hemolysis and axe seen in hemo 
lytic transfusion reactions and m paroxys 
mal cold and nocturnal hemoglobinurias 
QuantitTiiie Determimtion of Plasma 
Hemoglobin Ham modified the benzidine 
method of Bing and Baker for quantitative 
determmauon of plasma hemoglobm (Bing 
and Baker 1931 Page and Culver 1960) 
A more recent micromeihod was mtroduced 
by Crosby and Furth (1956) Careful tech 
nique to avoid adding to the hemolysis is 
essential for correct interpretation of all 
tests for hemoglobin The benzidine method 
does not distinguish between hemoglobin 
sulfhemoglobm and methemalbumm The 
latter imparts to the plasma a brown color 
and can be identified with the Sclmmin test 
Nine volumes of plasma or scrum arc over 
laid with a layer of ether in a large test lube 
One volume of saturated solution of am 
momum sulfide is added with a pipet After 
thorough mixing the contents are poured 
into a hand spectroscope An absorption bind 
at 558 mfi mdicates a positive test for met 
hemalbumin (Page and Culver I960) 

If the rate of destruction is not rapid 
there is no hemoglobinemia or hemoglobin 
una but elevated bilirubin In the serum and 
increased urobilinogen in the urine and 
stools are found In some cases hemosiderin 
may be present in the unne The normal 
urobilinogen in a 24 hour specimen is 0 to 
3 5 mg in urine and 40 to 280 mg Jn the 
stool Following excessive hemolysis it mny 
increase to 5 to 200 mg in the unne and to 
300 to 4000 mg in the stool The examina 
Uon of feces is more dependable than of the 
unne because it may show an increisc 
when the unne shows none It may show 
an increase even when the serum billnibin 
IS not raised The latter finding is explained

Clinical Diagnosis b\ Laboratory Methods 


"b) the fact that the normal h\er has the 
capacity to remo%e large amounts of free 
hemoglobin from the blood The de\elop> 
ment of anemia as a result of he/no]}sis 
depends on the erythropoietic capacity of 
Ae marrow Wintrobe (1961) speaks of 
“compensated hemolytic disease” when 
Memia does not follow hemolysis and of 
"decompensated hemolytic disease" when 
anemia deielops 

The Blood Smear The anemia is nor 
mocytic as a rule Jt may be macrocytic 
^Vhat one sees in the blood smear is noth 
ing else but the expression of the capacity 
of the marrow to compensate for the lost 
blood Here belong amsocytosis and poikilo 
cytosis (usually more of the former than of 
the latter) reticulocytosis (much larger 
number of reticulocytes in raassue acute 
hemolysis than in chronic) polychroroato- 
phiha (i e reticulocytes without the bene 
fit of vital stain) and normoblasts Macro- 
cytosis IS an expression of the presence of 
immature red cells which are larger than 
normocytes 

When in response to excessne blood 
destruction the call for Increased production 
leaches the marrow it reacts usually as an 
organ and releases excessive numbers and 
younger fonns of leukocytes and platelets 
together with erythrocytes The result is 
leukocytosis rath a “shift to the left” and 
thrombocytosis with abnormal and giant 
platelets The other findings are spherocytes 
In hereditary and acquired hemolytic ane- 
mia schlstocytes (fragmented red cells) 
and erythrophagocytosis 

The spherocytes in acquired hemolytic 
anemia are larger and are called overby 
drated “macrospherocytes” as distinguished 
from underhydrated "microspherocyies" of 
hereditary spherocytosis The consequences 
of spherocytosis are defecti\e rouleaux for 
mation which may exert a retarding m 
fiuence on the sedimentation rate of eryth 
rocytes and a “shift to the left" of the 
osmotic fragihty cur\e 

Hemolyttc Anemias due to Intrinsic

Hereditary Spherocytosis 

Definition This is a hereditary corpuscu 
lar abnormaUty characterized by the pres- 
ence of spherocytes and bouts of 
hemolysis (hemolyuc crises) The cau^ of 
the crises is belieYcd to be acute aplasia 
(Plate 4-5 [2]) 

Increased osmotic fragility is charac 
tenstic Occasionally the fragility of incu 


bated cells has to be tested to establish the 
diagnosis It may be considerably greater 
than the fragihty of the nomneubated cells 
The antiglobulin test is usually negauie 
Splenectomy is as a rule curatne 
HEREDiTARy Nonspiierocytic Hemolytic 
Anemia 

This anemia is climcally similar to the 
spherocytic disease The osmotic fragility is 
normal but it is considerably increased 
when done rath premeubated red cells 
Splenectomy does not help 

Heheditasy Ovalocytosis 
Ovalocytes are abundant in the peripheral 
smear The deformity is increased in sealed 
moist preparations Most patients with this 
oeUttlar abnarmahey are not ifi except about 
10 to 15 per cent who develop mild anemia 
(Plate 4~1 [5])

mersion lens Heinz bodies appear as 
rounded or irregularly shaped deep purple 
refracUle particles (thus differing from 
Ifowell Jolly bodies which are always round 
and form siderotic granules known as Pap 
penheimer bodies which are bluish black) 
The network in reticulocytes stains pale 
blue With brilliant cresyl blue Heinz bodies 
stain lighter blue than the filaments of 
reticulocytes Heinz bodies can also be 
demonstrated in wet preparations as re 
fractUe particles ranging from being just 
vosible up to 3 microns and tending to he 
close to the periphery Only mature eryth 
rocytes develop Heinz bodies reticulocytes 
do not Red cells with Heinz bodies are re 
moved from the circulation by the spleen 
or as some claim the Heinz bodies are 
extracted from the red cells by splenic 
action 

The Palliogenevis of Heinz Bo<ly \ncmia 
Intracellular oxidation may lead to hemoly 
81 S and hemolytic anemia The intensity of 
intracellular oxidation vanes from mild 
which is manifested by reduction of intra 
cellular glutathione through moderate oxi 
dation with mcthemoglohm appearing in 
the cell to severe oxidation witli denatura 
tion and precipitation of hemoglobm lead 
ing to formation of Heinz bodies with stain 
able intracellular granules 

Heinz granules may appear spontaneously 
in premature infants as well as in adults 
following splenectomy without history of 
drug intake or they may be induced by 
chemicals When given in therapeutic doses 
drugs do not affect normal red cells but 
produce anemia with Heinz bodies in sus- 
ceptible patients especially Negroes (Dem 
et al 1954) This happened In about 10 per 
cent of male Negroes vvhowere given 30 mg 
of prunaqume a day The deficiency In the 
susceptible red ceils is believed to be in the 
oxidative enzyme glucose 6 phosphate de 
hydrogenase (Carson et al 1956) This 
form of anemia was shown to be due to a 
hereditary sex linked susceptibility to drugs 
Rea cells exposed to the drugs showed a de 
crease in the concentration of reduced 
glutathione Older cefls were more sus 
ceptible An unstable glutathione system is 
held responsible Premature and newborn 
infants have an unstable glutathione system

and may develop hemolytic anemia and 
jaundice following intake of vitamin K 

Wnghts stained blood smears m drug 
induced or Heinz body anemia show mis 
shapen red cells m addition to spherocytosis 
and basophilic stippling Such findings 
should suggest the special examination and 
stain for Heinz bodies They can be seen 
also in vvet preparations with darkfield and 
phascKiontrast microscopy 

For controls artificially induced Heinz 
bodies can be seen in normal blood to which 
acetylphcnylhydrazine has been added The 
blood turns brown and should then be 
examined 

The chemicals and drugs responsible for 
Heinz body hemolytic anemia include 
naphthoquinone in moth balls which can 
be absorbed via the skin or inhaled by in 
fants and acetanlhd (phenacetm) in 
adults 

In some cases of hemolytic anemia of 
indefinite etiology also called “inclusion 
body anemia siderocytes (Pappenheimer 
bodies) have been described They arc rod 
shaped or round bodies when stained with 
Wnghts stain and with other Romanowsky 
dyes They are present in the peripheral 
blood only afier splenectomy but can also 
be seen in marrow preparations in the non 
splencctomized The marrow shows normo 
blastic hyperplasia 

The various forms of hemolytic anemia 
arranged according to etiology have been 
summarized in Table 4—5

formed Heinz bodies led to a test for red 
cell sensitivity to some drugs (primaquine 
acetanilid some sulfonamides phenylhy 
drazine sulfoxone and plienacetin) 

Test for red cell semtlwiiy Reagent 
AcetyJphenylhydrazme 100 mg per 100 ml 
of buffered sabne 

Procedure To 2 ml of the reagent 
in a test tube add 0 1 ml of blood mix well 
and place In 37® C water bath for two 
hours A small drop of the blood is placed 
on a co\ershp Tlie covershp is inverted 
over a large drop of a 2 per cent solution 
of crystal violet 

Result From 45 to 92 per cent of 
erythrocytes of a sensitive person may con 
tain Heinz bodies Only 0 to 28 per cent 
were present in nonsensitive controls (Dem 
et al 1954 1955) The same authors re 
ported a lowering of glutathione to two- 
Ihirds of normal in sensitive red cells

Infectious Agents 

Destruction of erythrocytes by plasmodia 
is responsible for the anemia in malaria 
This is supponed by the obsen ailon that the 
osmotic and mechanical fragility of para 
situcd erythrocytes is increased Inhibition 
of marrow activity may be an additional 
factor Fulminant hemoglobinuria (black 
water fever) is a complication of P fat

IMMUNE MECHANISMS 

Immunohematology has been defined as 
the branch of medicine dealing with dis 
eases of blood of which the cause the patho- 
genesis or clinical manifestations have 
been shown to be determined bj an antigen 
antibody reaction" (Davidsohn 1954) 


IMMUNOHEMA TOLOG^ 

From this definition it is obvious that im 
munohematologic laboratory tests comprl^ 
a wide variety of techniques with one coni 
mon denominator they are based on im 
munologic reactions hi wldch blood cells 
participate For reasons of convenience

some tests belonging m this category are 
treated in other sections of this book as 
indicated by suitable references Although 
all three corpuscular elements of blood may 
be involved in immunohematologic tests 
the methodology of the tests in which white 
cells and platelets are involved is as yet 
not fully developed for general practical 
application 


Immune Diseases oe the Bloou and 
Blood Forming Tissues 

Definition These are diseases in which 
an antigen antibody reaction is involved in 
one or more of the following the cause of 
the disease the pathogenesis or a diag 
nostic test for the disease 

Pathogenesis of Immune Diseases Hetero 
immune diseaies The antigen is a foreign 
bving agent invading the host and capable 
of multiplying withm the body of the host 
The antibody is produced in the body of 
the host Examples acute acquired hemo 
iytic anemia in virus pneumonia the test 
for infectious mononucleosis 

/soimnnuie diseases The antigen comes 
from another person or is a part of the host 
(usually blood) The antibody is a part of 
the host Or comes from another person 
Examples Hemolytic transfusion reaction 
feral erythroblastosis (hemolytic disease of 
the newborn) isoimmune leukopenia and 
isoimmune thrombocytopema 
Isoimmune hemolysis may be the result 
of transfusion of incompatible red cells or 
of incompatible plasma Injection of in 
compatible red cells may be followed by a 
wAVv v*a 

characteristic cbmeal picture (p 303 ff ) 
Anemia is not a part of this type of hemo 
lytic transfusion reaction but it may trigger 
an autoimmune hemolytic process in the 
host Injection of mcompatible plasma may 
produce an anemia if the transfused plasma 
contains an excessively high titer of iso 
agglutinin or if it contains immune isoag 
glutinms in which case hemolysis may 
result even if the Uter is low This type of 
isoimmune hemolytic anemia may follow 
the transfusion of blood of group O to re 
cipients of groups A B or AB Isobemolysis 
may be the result of the action of several 
types of isoantibodies (1) Isohemolysins 
which are present m the serum of a rela 
lively small number of normal persons 
They may be mcreased considerably by 
various therapeutic and prophylactic im 


Laboratorv Methods 

mui^tions (2) Isoagglutinms which do 
not hemolyze red cells in vitro but in viio 
prepare them for the hemolytic acuon of 
“6 reticuloendothebal system (Jandi et at 

Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn 
(Fetal Erythroblastosis) The anemia of 
hemolyuc disease of the newborn is of the 
isoimmune type The isoantiLody comes 
from the mother via the placenta (p 305 ff ) 

The Blood Findings tn Hemolytic Dis 
ease of the Neivbom 

Early examination of the blood usually 
reveals an increase of immature nucleated 
erythrocytes (prononnoblasts and normo- 
blasts On the other hand although this 
finding gave the disease its name erythro- 
blastemia is not always present especially 
if the exammation is not done immediately 
after birth 

From 200 to 2000 nucleated erythrocytes 
per cubic millimeter may be present in term 
infants and up to 5000 m premature in 
fants Blood from the umbilical vein for 
early examinauon is more reliable than 
penpheral (capillary) blood because the 
erythrocyte count and the bemoglobm may 
be significantly altered between bulb and 
ligation of the cord 

Generally there is a macrocyuc anemia of 
varying seventy and an increase in reticulo- 
cytes In fetal erythroblastosis caused by 
ABO incompaubility spherocytes are con 
spicuous Occasion^y anemia may appear 
suddenly on the second or third day or even 
later The platelet count is frequently below 
rhe lower normal value of J50 000 to 250 
000 per cu mm \Vhen the nucleated eryth 
cocytft ccDittt. Vi (10 000 ox. tonm pec 
cu mm ) the leukocyte count (which is 
frequently elevated) must be corrected Fre- 
quently the differential count shows a leuke- 
nioid blood picture with many immature 
leukocytes including myelocytes (Plates 4- 
5(5] 4-7) There is pronounced normo- 
blastic hyperplasia of the marrow 

Autoimmune Diseases. The antigen is an 
autoantigen (a modified part of the patient s 
own body ) The antibody is an autoanUbody 
(also a modified part of the pauents own 
body) Examples Idiopathic and sympto- 
matic autoimmune hemolytic anemia auto 
immune leukopema and paroxysmal cold 
hemoglobmuna 

Knowledge of autoimmune diseases goes 
back to the end of the 19th century but was 
pushed into the background by the authonty 
of Paul Ehrlich who corned the phrase 



The 


“horror autotoxicus wth which he coc 
pressed his com’iction that antibodies could 
not be formed m the bod> against its own 
tissues because this would not be com 
paiible with life There were occasional 
break throughs such as Donath and Land 
Steiners test for cold paroxysmal hemo 
globinuria (1904) and studies on hemol}tic 
anemia by the French hematologists of the 
beginning of the century (Chauffard and 
Troisier 1908 Widal et al 1908) 

The recent great advances have been 
made possible by the progress in our 
knowledge and understanding of antibodies 
There are some that do not react in saline 
but need plasma albumin macromolecular 
substances in general and proteoljtic en 
zymes These are the so-called incomplete 
antibodies as compared tvith the previously 
well known so-caUed complete antibodies 
which react well in saline Much of this new 
knowledge came as a by product of studies 
on the Rh factor 

All antibodies are globulins Some anli 
bodies react only at warm (body) tempera 
tures and others at cold temperatures with 
optimums at a particular degree of tempera 
lure Some react only at a certain pH Some 
agglutinate only but do not hemolyze di 
rectly The ag^utinated red cells become 
subject to destructive forces m the reticulo- 
endothelial system Some are hemolysins 
lysis taking place at only one temperature 
warm or cold (monothermal) Some are 
hemolysins but require tuo temperature 
levels first cold and then warm (bithcrmal) 
Incomplete nnrm autohemomitibodics 
Definition These are abnormal serum 
globulins that combine with red cells at 
37° C Demonstrable reactions eg ag 
glutination do not occur m saline except 
when the red cells are treated with proteo 
lytic enzymes hut reactions can be demon 
strated in macromolecular mediums such 
as serum albumin and plasma and with the 
indirect antiglobubn test 

Elution of Autoantibodies Incom 
plete autoantibodies can be separated from 
the red cells by suspending the latter In 
small amounts of sahne of suitable tempera 
ture and centrifuging at the same tempera 
ture The supernatant contains the anti 
bodies Maximum elution of warm anu 
bodies takes place at 56° C In the body 
red cells coated with these antibodies are 
rapidly destroyed Warm antibodies are re 
sponsible for idiopathic and symptomatic 
acquired hemolytic anemia 

Warm autohemolysins occasionally are 


167 

present together with warm autoagglutmins 
md react best at 37° C They have not been 
studied sufficiently 

Cold ngghtttmns Cold agglutimns are 
nonspecific antibodies that agglutinate the 
patient s own and other human erythrocytes 
regardless of blood group Reaction tempera 
lure ranges from 0° to 20° C At 0° to 
10° C cold agglutinins are almost universal 
Antibodies reacting only at such low tern 
peratures have no pathologic significance 
They are the so-called physiologic cold ag 
glutinins 

Pathologic agglutimns also exert maxi 
mal effect at 0° but have a wider thermal 
amplitude The highest temperature at 
which they react is as a rule 30° C 

The range of titers of physiologic cold 
agglutmms at 0° C is 0 to 128 The most 
frequent liter around 1 to 8 In chrome 
cold agglutinins disease the range is 4000 
to 130 000 (maximum reported) Erythro 
cytes coated with cold agglutimns have m 
creased mechanical fragility 

Hetttolystns 

J Natural isohemolysins are rare They 
have been reported m some of the blood 
group systems eg Lewis (see p 278) 

2 Immune isoliemolysms are seen fol 
lowing injection of incompatible blood or 
so-called punfied specific blood group sub 
stances 

3 Bithermal autohemolysins are seen in 
cold paroxysmal hemoglobinuria 

Bithermal cold autohemolysms are ab 
normal serum globulin capable of hemo- 
lyzing the patients own and other persons 
red cells 

They combine with erythrocytes (sensi 
tization of erythrocytes) at temperature be 
low 20° C TTiey do not combine with red 
cells at temperature higher than 20° C 
When temperature rises to 25° C hemoly 
SIS begms The optimum temperature for 
hemolysis is 40° C The titers are low 
2 to 16 the highest recorded was 64 and 
even then it was transient 

4 Monothermal cold autohemolysms 
having a thermal range of 15 to 30° C 
(optimum 22° C ) occur simultaneously 
with high titered cold agglutinins They are 
the cause of excessive destruction of red 
cells and of hemolytic anemia They react 
best at slightly acid pH (acid hemolysins) 
the optimum pH is 6 3 and the range pH 
6 to 7 The serum is acidified by adding 10 
volumes per cent of 0 4 N HCI The range of 
titers of cold monothermal autohemolysms

cannot be seen here To the right of the granulocyte touching It and slightly deforinod by it is probably 
a basophilic normoblast As we travel down the circle we find at 2 o clock two polychromatophUic 
normoblasts of which there are many m the preparation Tliese cells are somewhat younger than a number 
of almost orthochromatic nomiobtasts with their small dense pyknotic nuclei One of them is impinging 
on or more correctly is being Impinged upon by the second of two polychromatophilic normobtasls which 
we have just described At 4 o clock we find in a colony of eleven cells three varieties of erytliroid cells The 
one at which the arrow is pointing is a proerythroblast lis chromatin is loosely knitted and a has three 
distinct nucleoli and a deeply basophilic cytoplasm Touching it toward the center of the field is a normoblast 
that differs from the proeiythtoblsst just described by the coarsening of its nucleus and the almost poly 
chromatupliilic color of its cytoplasm owing to advancing hemoglobinlzation This cell which is best 
labeled as a polychromatophilic normoblast is just slightly younger than the two fully ripened pofyehromato- 
philic normoblasts Just above and the six just below the proerythroblast The large cell toward the center 
of the field bordering on the six polychromatophilic normoblasts just described is another proerythroblast 
At 7 0 clock the arrow points at a neutrophilic myelocyte Covering it toward the center are two polv 
chnmatophilic normoblasts followed in the same direction by a promyelocyte Note the difference between 
the fewer and coarser granules of the promyelocyte and the abundant and finer granules of the myelocyte 
At 8 o clock the arrow points at another proerythroblast dmmcUy younger than the one at 4 o clock The 
larger nucleus and (he looser structure of the chromatin testify to Its younger age fiotighly at J{ o clock 
we see what looks like the cytoplasmic body of a neutrophilic myrlocyie cut in half with the nucleus left 
outside The amputated cell IS surrounded by two basophilic normoblasts (Plate from Heilmeyer L and 
Begemann H Aths der Klinischen Hamatologie und Cytologie Springer ID55 ) 


Plate 4-7 Hemolytic disease of the newborn (fetal erythroblastosis) peripheral blood The erythro-

Test for Autohemobjsis 

Sterile clotted normal blood incubated for 
24 hours shows no hemolysis or only mmi 
mal traces (0 to 0 5 per cent m a quanti 
tatne test) and only \ery small amounts 
after 48 hours (0 4 to 3 5 per cent in a 
quantitative test) Hemolysis is accelerated 
and more pronounced in hereditary sphero- 
cytosis paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobmu 
na hemolytic anemia caused by chemicals 
such as acetylphenylhydrazme, acquired 
autoimmune hemolytic anemias with spher 
ocytosis and one form of congenital non 
spherocytic hemolyuc anemia (Selvv-yn and 
Dacie 1954) A sample of the preincubaoon 
serum is used as a control In a quantitative

Collection of Blood and Serum For the 
study of cold autoantibodies it is best to 
collect the blood with a prewarmed synnge 
m a prewarmed test tube (both at 37® C ) 
and to place the tube immediately into a 
container with water maintained at 37® C 
until It IS transferred into an incubator 
There it remains until it clots and the dot 
IS retracted Centrifugation must also be 


Laboratorv Methods 

earned out at the same temperature The 
serum is then removed vwth a capillary 
inpet If cells are mixed with the serum 
the specimen must be recentnfuged at 37® 
C The procedure may be simplified some 
what by using a prevv armed vacutamer tube 

Red cells can be obtained from the same 
specimen by breaking up the warm clot 
transferring them to a test tube vviih warm 
(37® C ) saline washing with warm s^e 
and centnfugmg at the same temperature 
They can also be obtained with an anu 
coagulant, e g , acid citrate-dextrose (ACD) 
or oxalate but again mamtammg 37® C 
IS essential 

For shippmg by mail, the serum ob- 
tained as described and whole blood col 
lected in ACD solution should be sent Upon 
amval at the destination the whole blood 
will have to he placed in an incubator 
before the cells are washed Serum should 
be stored frozen m 1 to 2 ml vials at —20® 
C or less Red cells will keep for two to three 
weeks in ACD or m another suitable solu 
non They can be kept for considerably 
longer penods at —20® C in glycerin (Chap- 
hn et al , 1954) Once washed and sus 
pended m salme, they must be used within 
a few hours 


Plate 4~8 Hormal marrow At the 12 o clock position the arrow points to an island of eix cells Two at 
the top are neutrophilic myelocytes lying next to each other The next two toward the center are a pro- 
myelocyte on the left and an eosinophilic myelocyte on its right The visible portion of a cell partly covered 
by the promyelocyte is probably a normoblast Next to it on the right is a neutrophilic segmented granulo- 
c^e 

At the bottom of the circle the arrow is directed at a metamyelocyte Just above it is a reticulum cell 
someivhat deformed and crowded by the adjacent red cells 

At 7 o clock there is a metamyelocyte 

At 9 o clock there is a myelocyte and next to it and below, a plasma cell 

At 10 o clock a proerythroblast is seen and just a short distance away clockwise are two orthochromaue 
normoblasts 

There is a superficial resemblance between the proerythroblast and the plasma cells The mam difference 
IS in the sire and structure of the nucleus In the proerythroblast the nucleus is larger and the chromatin is 
debcately reticulated and granular In the plasma cell it is more compact and clumped Jn this reproduction 
of the plasma cell the separation into chromatin and paracbromatin masses is not apparent. The presence 
of hemoglobin m the cytoplasm of the proerythroblast even if only traces of it are present may sometimes 
be another differential point (Plate from Heilmeyer L and Begemann H Atlas der Kbnischen Hama 
tologie und Cytologic Springer, 1955 )

Testing for Auioantibodics. The direct 
antjglobuUn (Coombs) lest detects anti 
bodies attached to red cells (see p 275) 
The indirect anuglofaulm (Coombs) test 
(ICT) detects free autoantibodies in the 
serum Warm autoantibodies are detectable 
more Teadil> wth enzyine treated red cells 
than mth the ICT test (for techmcal de- 
tails see p 276) On the other hand cold 
autoantibodies are readilj detected wtb the 
mdirect antiglobulm lest Successful use of 
the ICT depends on meticulous technique 
and attention to sources of error The fol 
loiving outline is based on the recommenda 
Uons of Dacie (1956) 

The temperature The temperature 
recommended for mcubauon must be ad

only after normal incomplete cold amibod> 
has been absorbed from it The same applies 
to serum that has lost its complement ac 
Untv on prolonged standing 

On the other hand the warm autoanti

blood group factor that the recipient does 
not possess is transferred to the recipient 
eg 0 cells to recipients A or B or AB and 
ON cells to M or MN recipients After the 
transfusion serums with potent agglutinins 
for the red cells of the recipient are added 
to samples of the recipient s blood and the 
unagglutinated red cells are counted 

The Test A sample of the recipients 
blood obtained prior to the transfusion is 
tested first to serve as a control and for the 
selection of a serum reacting strongly with 
the cells of the recipient 

After the transfusion 0 1 ml of the re 
cipients blood is added to 4 9 ml of 3 per 
cent sodium citrate To 0 25 ml of this sus 
pension 0 25 ml of a potent agglutinating 
serum is added 

The optimum dilution of the agglutmat 
ing serum is determined with pretransfu 
sion blood The optimum dilution is one 
with which less than 10 000 unagglutinated 
red cells are found when the tested blood 
sample contains 5 000 000 red cells The 
blood serum mixture is left at room tem 
perature for at least two hours and then 
centrifuged at about 2500 rpm (300 G) 
for one minute The tube is shaken vigor 


ously to break up the large clumps into 
small ones The specimen is permitted to 
settle for not more than one minute and 
the upper three-fourths of the suspension 
js transferred with a pipet to another test 
tube which is then recentnfuged for one 
minute The sediment is mixed with the 
supernatant according to a standard pro 
cedure le 50 mversions at an angle of 
about 90* at the rate of one per second A 
countmg chamber is filled with the upper 
layer of the cell suspension The cells are 
permitted to settle for not less than two 
minutes Only the free cells are counted 
The number of the unaggluunated cells is 
expressed m absolute numbers per cubic 
millimeter or as a percentage of the number 
present after the transfusion (Molhson 
1956) 


The Radiochromium Method (Cr'O 

Principle Blood cells tagged with sodium 
chromate containmg a small amount of 
Cr** are transferred to the recipient The 
survival of the tagged cells is studied m 
samples removed at mtervals 
The Test 20 ml of the patients own or 
donors blood is removed labeled and m 
jected into the patient (for details of the 
technique see p 379)

Clinical Diagnosis b\ 

The clinical picture of the disease is the 
result of two enuties the basic lesion (neo- 
plasm lymphoma chronic infection) and 
anemia The anemia is frequently the mmor 
manifestation but may be in the foreground 
As a rule the anemia disappears when the 
basic ailment is treated successfully There 
IS no fundamental difference from the idio 
pathic variety Here too incomplete anti 
bodies are responsible for the shortened 
survival of red cells

of 33 cases of idiopathic hemolytic anemia 
in 50 per cent of 28 cases of symptomatic 
anemia and in 28 per cent of 14 cases of 
hereditary spherocytosis (Davadsohn et al

PAROXYSMAL COLD HEMOCLOCINtlWA 

The Qualitative Tist One blood sampje 
is collected in a previously wanned (37 
C ) test tube and Incubated at 37’ C ui tu 
it clots The other is placed in melting Ice 
for 30 minutes and then transferred without 
shaking to a water bath at 37* C Doth 



The Blood 


specimens are inspected after an hour or 
two when the clots have retracted In pa 
roxysmal cold hemoglobinuria the chilled 
and then warmed specimen will show 
hemolysis of the serum The specimen kept 
at 37® C will not show hemolysis 
The Indirect Test Serum is obtained 
from a specimen that has been permitted 
to clot at 37° C One volume of a 50 per 
cent suspension of washed normal O cells is 
added The suspension is placed In melting 
ice for 30 minutes, followed by incubation 
in a water bath at 37® C for 60 minutes 
Hemolysis is seen in the centrifuged sped 
men 

In another tube, a volume of fresh normal 
serum is added to the patient’s serum as a 
source of complement to compensate for 
a possible complement deficiency 

A control test tube is set up as for the 
patient’s serum but is kept at 37° C and 
should show no hemolysis 

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemo 
Globinuria (P N H ) 

Principle Recurrent hemoglobinuna. 
mainly auring sleep or on arising, is due to 
increased susceptibility of the red ceUs to 
the slight decrease of pH during sleep 
Hemosiderinuna is diagnosuc 

TEST FOR PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL 
HEMOGLOBINURIA (p N H ) 

Principle Patient’s red cells are hemo- 
iJzed by fresh (umnactivated) patient’s or 
normal serum at 37° C and a pH 6 5 to 7 0 
Reagents 

Patient’s red cells washed in saline 
Fresh normal serum 
Fresh washed normal red cells 
Procetinre One half a milhhter of fresh 
normal serum is placed in each of four 
tubes The serum in two tubes is acidified by 
adding one tenth volume (0 05 ml ) of 0 2 
N HCl The tubes are placed in the water 
bath at 37° C , and 0 05 ml of a 50 per 
cent suspension of* the patient s washed red 
cells IS added to one of the acidified serums 
and to one of the unacidified A similar 
amount of the normal red cells is added to 
the other two tubes After one hour’s meu 
faation, the tubes are centrifuged 

Two controls are set up one with un 
acidified patient’s or normal serum and 
another with normal cells Hemolysis in the 
test with acidified serum plus the patient’s 
red cells and no or only significantly less 


179 

hemolysis in the controls with the patient s 
cdls in the unacidified serum are positive 
for P N H (Ham, 1939) There should 
be no hemolysis m the tubes with normal 
cells False positive results may be obtamed 
with blood contammg a large number of 
spherocytes Differentiation is possible by 
using serum inactivated at 56° C for 10 
to 30 minutes P N H cells will not hemo 
lyze m inactivated serum, spherocytes will 
be lysed Accordmg to Crosby (1950) addi 
tion of thrombm to the acidified serum 
makes the test more specific 

Allergic Autoimmune Hemo 
LYTIC Disease 

Principle The antigen is formed m the 
body from (a) an exogenous component 
(allergen) which by itself is not antigenic 
but is a “hapten” (half antigen), and (b) 
a part of the host, a protein (a) may be a 
simple chemical compound (a) + (b) = 
anugen, which stimulates antibody produc 
tion 

The basis for this process is an abnormal 
reactivity of the host After antibodies have 
developed, there are no manifestations until 
new exposure occurs to the allergen The 
routes of entry of the allergen may be 
enteral, parenteral, inhalation or contact 
Result allergic hemolytic reaction Tlie 
autoantibody by itself cannot react with the 
patients red cells until the allergen is rein 
troduced 

Allergic Autoimmune Hemo- 
lytic Reactions 

Pruidple Hemolytic cnsis after oral or

erythopathies are hereditary 

4 Agent reacts with red cells of sensiti\e 
persons Acute fulminant anemia of this 
t^-pe follows exposure to the fa\abean (see 
p 164) This reaction is immunologic 

5 Responsible agent acts as hapten and 
combmes ^vlth a body protem to a complex 
antigen which stimulates production of 
antibodies IVhen the same agent is read 
nutted an anubody reaction results with 
damage to red cells 

Mechanism AJiei^ic tmmunotogic 

Principle Antibody reacts with patients 
red cells but only in the presence of the 
responsible drug 

Example The patient recei\ed a drug 
without a reaction The drug is administered 
the second tune after varying intervals 
which may be >ears The second admmisira 
tion IS followed by an acute hemolytic teac 
tion with hemo^obinunc anemia and a 
positive direct Coombs test Antibodies re- 
act duectly but only after small amoimts of 
the drug were added No other antibodies 
demonstrable The serum factor may be 
transferred passively to a normal person by 
transfusing the plasma of the allergic indi

Summary of Immunohematologtc Tests for 
the Diagnosis of Autoimmune 
Hemolytic Anemia 

Available methods permit a step-by step 
analysis of acquued autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia The irect antiglobulin test detects 


cell Ixjund antibodies The quanutativ e anti 
^obulm test and the gamma globiilin neu 
traiization test answer the question as to 
the thermal range of the autoantibodies 
The specificity of the autoantibodies can 
be determined vnth the antiglobulin test 
with eoziTne treated red cells with the elu 
tion techraque and by typing and genotyp- 
ing the patients red cells The free auto- 
antibodies m the circulating blood can be 
studied with agglutinauon and indirect anu 
globubn tests at various temperatures and 
with the Donath Landsteiner test Tlie 
hemol>tic autoanubody can be studied wnth 
acidified serum and with enzyme treated 
red cells The role of the complement can 
also be studied using appropriate set ups 


Some Chemical rtndnigs in the lilooil and 
Urine in Hemolytic Anemia 


The hemoglobineima and hemoglobinuria 
of acute hemolysis have been discussed pre 
viously (see p 361) 

Hemoglobmuna must be differentiated 
from myoglobmuna which follows destruc 
tion of muscle 

In chronic blood destruction mcrease of 
indirectly reacting serum bihrubm and in 
creased excretion of urobilinogen are found 
The rate of blood formation and the func 
tional capacit) of the liver influence the 
amount of urobilmogen found m the stools 
The so-called hemolytic index gives a cor 
reeled value for the hemoglobin breakdown

The morphologic findings m the penph 
eral blood include changes reflecting m 
creased regeneration of blood cells such as 
poljchromatophilia, reticulocytosis, noimo- 
blasteima poikilo- and amsocytosis, and in 
some cases spheroc>tosis Leukocytosis and 
thrombocytosis are present frequently The 
findmgs in the marrow correspond wth 
those descnbed in the peripheral blood, 
namely normoblastic hyperplasia (Plate

Snmmnr^ of Tests for Hemolytic Anemia 

Hemolytic anemia is caused by abnormal 
and excessive destruction of red cells Eight 
groups of tests are available, each aimed 
at the detection of a different mechanism 
responsible for, involved m, or resultmg 
from the destruction 

I Intracorpuscular abnormalities Ab- 
normal red cell structure 

1 Tests for osmotic fragihty These 
are tests for increased sensiuvity of the 
erythrocytes to hvpotonic solutions of so- 
dium chlonde (see page 96 ff ) 

2 Tests for mechanical fragility (see 

P 99) 

3 Tests for autohemolysis (see p 

170)

Iron Metabolism 

Iron is an essential component of hemo- 
globm and of other body cells The average 
diet contams 5 to 15 mg per dav The 
normal adult has 4 to 5 gm of iron in the 
body Over 60 per cent of the body’s iron is 
in the hemoglobin of circulating red cells 
About 1 mg of iron is contained in each 
millibter of red cells About 3 to 4 per cent 
of the body s iron is present m enzymes 
of the red cells and the myoglobin and the 
rest IS stored as femtin, submicroscopic 
particles of iron m tissues and as hemo- 
siderin larger particles of iron demonstrable 
microscopically Very bttle iron is excreted 
from the body Only a few imlbgrams of 
iron are absorbed daily from the food even 
in the presence of an iron deficiency ane 
nua "Transfemn,” a serum iron binding 
protein a beta giobulm transports absorbed 
iron The body’s iron is used again and 
again practically without any loss Less 
than 1 mg of iron is lost daily in the unne 
bile, and other secretions Consequently 
deficient supply of iron in the diet or made 
quate absorption in the diet results in iron 
defiaency only when either of the tiro or 
both are complicated by an increased need 
for iron as it exists during rapid growth la 
infancy and childhood or during pregnancy 
or vvhen excessive Joss of blood has reduc^ 
the body’s reserves of iron, as following re

The synonym, iron deficiency anenus

hypochromic anemia (late chlorosis) le 
scmbles chlorosis but occurs mainly in 
women between 20 and 50 years It is asso- 
ciated frequently with achloxhydna and oc 
casionally may be complicated by difficulty 
in swallowing (the Plummer Vinson syn 
drome or Waldenstroms sideropenic dys 
phagia) (Waldenstrom and Kjehberg 
1939) Low plasma iron is present in all 
cases 

Laboratory Findings 
The Blood The stained blood smear 
shows microcytosis anisocytosis pmkilocy 
tosis (including elhptical and elongated 
cells) and varying degrees of hypochromia 
(see p 116) (Plate 4-1) Reticulocytes 
are ivitbin normal limits except follomng 
hemorrhage and iron therapy The number 
of red cells is rarely as low as in pernicious 
anemia The hemoglobin and hematoent 
may be extremely low The fragility of red 
cells IS normal but occasionally there may 
be a slight increase in resistance 
Chemical examination may show hypo 
proteinemla serum sideropenia increase of 
the serum iron binding capacity and in 
crease of serum copper and of erythrocyte 
protoporphyrin Tlie latter may be as high 
as 500 micrograms per 100 ml of red cells 
whereas normally the range is 20 to 38 
imcrogrims Moderate increases have been 
reported in hemolytic and refractor) ane 
mia leukemia Hodgkins disease and mul 
tjple myeloma (from 30 to 150 micro 
grams) Increases comparable to those seen 
in iron dehcienc) anemia have been re 
ported m anemia due to heavy metal in 
toxication and somewhat lower levels in 
anemia of chronic infection The white 
blood cell count is normal or slightly low 
ered Granulocytopenia relative lymphocy 
tosis and a small number of poijsegmented 
granulocytes ma) be present Tlie platelets 
are normal except in a rare case when the 
count may be slightly lower Achlorhjdna is 
common No free hjdrochlonc acid even 
after histamine was reported in 50 to 60 
per cent of cases (Wintmbe 1961) 

Tlie marrow shows normoblastic hyper 
plasia The normoblasts are smaller than 
normal and are deficient in hemoglobin 
They are irregular m shape with frayed 
margins Smears stained for hemosiderin 
show none 

Laboratory Diagnosis 
Thcrapeimc Ttst The therapeutic test Is 
based on the reticulocyte response to oral 


181 

or parenteral administration of iron The 
response is directly proportionate to the 
severity of the anemia The increase of 
reticulocytes is least pronounced following 
acute blood loss in patients who did not 
receive iron It is pronounced following iron 
intake in patients with iron deficiency ane 
mia but the highest peaks arc seen follow 
ing administration of vitamin B, or folic 
acid in patients with the corresponding defi 
ciency anemia (Schodt 1938) 
Hemosiderin Hemosiderin in marrow is 
a sensitive indicator of iron deficiency The 
diagnosis is established if no hemosiderin 
IS found in good preparations stained in the 
usual fashion (Wnghts or Giemsa stain) 
or stained specially for the Prussian blue 
reaction 

Scrum Iron The normal range is from 
80 to 180 micrograms per 100 ml of serum 
Lesser levels are present in iron deficiency 
but may be seen also m chronic infections 
and 1 number of other chrome diseases 
Serum Iron Binding Capacity This dc 
teimination helps to difTerentiatc iron defi 
ciency anemia from the other conditions 
with low serum iron In iron deficiency 
anemia the serum iron binding capacity 
is increased It is decreased in the other con 
ditions with low serum iron The normal 
total senim iron binding capacity is 300 
to 450 micrograms per 100 ml 

Differential Diagnosis 
Pyndoxtnc deficiency Is responsible for a 
hypochromic microcytic anemia resembling 
morphologically iron deficiency anemia It 
differs by elevated serum iron hemosidero- 
sis and the presence of abnormal trypto 
phan derivatives In the unne (Harris ct al 
1956) 

Hypochromic anemia in chrome plumb 
tsm is caused by the injurious effect of lead 
poisoning on heme synthesis The pro- 
nounced Increase of coproporphyrin III in 
the unne in lead poisoning helps to estab- 
hsh the true nature of the mcmia

S)Tion)m It IS also called addisoiuan 
anemia because the disease was descnbed 
fully by Addison in 1855 

Pathogenesis Deficiency in substances es 
sential for the synthesis of deoxynbonucleic 
acid with resultmg defects in nuclear de 
velopment 

Vitamins of the B complex include Bi*. 
and folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid PGA) 
The two are thought to be coenzymes 

Vitamin B, deficiency The essential 
substances are (1) vitamm Bi-. the ex 
tnnsic factor which Is synthesized by bac 
teria It is contained In the flesh and 
especially in the luer of animals (2) The 
intrinsic factor which is essential for the 
absorption of vitamin B, is produced by 
the mucosa of the fundus of the stomach 
The combined vitamin Bj-i and intnnsic 
factors are absorbed in the small intestine 
Considerable stores of vitamin B,« are pres 
ent m the liter 1 to 2 micrograms per 
gram of liver m healthy adults Vitamui 
B, deficiency is rare even m persons on a 
deficient diet except in extreme vegetarians 
In most instances vitamin Bi deficiency is 
actually the result of lack of the intnnsic 
factors as seen in pernicious anemia after 
destruction of the mucosal glands in the 
gastric fundus and after total gastrectomy 
Other causes of vitamin Bi deficiency are 
disturbances of intestinal absorpuon as it 
occurs in certain diseases for example in 
sprue and regional entenus and after re 
section of parts of the small intestine Fish 
fapewurm infestation may have a samlar 
effect It is explamed by absorption of vita 
mm Bi-. by the worm 

Folic acid deficiency From 500 to 1500 
micrograms of fofic acirf per cent of 
It conjugated with glutamic acid) is present 
in the average daily diet Only one third of it 
is absorbed and only 4 to 5 micrograms is 
excreted in the unne 

Dietary deficiency of folic acid is more 
frequent than vitamin B,™ deficiency espe 
ciaUy in chrome alcohobes m the aged 
in mtestmal malabsorption and as a com 
pheanon of therapy vvith folic acid antago* 
msts 

Pernicious anemia of pregnancy is 
suspected of being caused by a fobc acid 
deficiency The morphologic changes in the 
penpberal blood may be less pronounced 
and those m the myeloid cells of the mar 
row are as a rule more pronounced than in 
true pernicious anemia 

Differential Diagnostic (Therapeutic)

sponse Large doses of fohe acid (10 to 100 
mg) are moderately effecuve in vitamin 
B,. deficiency “false positive” responses 
Large doses of vitamin Bp may be similarly 
effective m folic acid deficiency 

Blood Morphology Erytlirocyles Macro- 
CYTOSIS AND MzGALOCYTOSIS The MC\ 
(mean corpuscular volume) is elevated It 
may be from 9o to 110 cu ^ (cubic microns) 
m mild disease and considerably higher in 
severe The normal M C V is 82 to 92 cu ^ 
PomiLOCYTOsis is always present and 
IS moderate to severe Bizarre shapes are 
characteristic 

Anisocytosis IS also regularly present 
and IS moderate to marked 

(Figs 4-49 4 SO Plates 4-3[6I 4-10 
4 n 4-12 4-13 ) 

Hemoglobin as noted m blood smears 
IS abundant Hypochromia Is rare and ap- 
pears only when iron deficiency is also pres- 
ent The appearance in the blood smears 
of excessive filling with hemoglobin is mis 
leading and is caused by increased thick 
ness of the cell Consequently the term by 
perchromic anemia is inappropriate 

ibnonnal cells Polychromatophilia 
may be present usually in cells of increased 
size These are as a rule young cells 
(reticulocytes) Reticulocytosis is present 
only during therapy Stippled cells (punc 
tate basophilia) may be present Howell 
Jolly bodies and Cabots rings may be seen 
Basophibc polychromatophibc and ortho- 
chromatic megaloblastic cells are also 
present especially m untreated or inade- 
quately treated patients 

Leukocytes Leukopeiua is the rule 
Large mufUsegmentecf/eaiocyreswirhmurY 
than the upper normal of five segments 
(polysegmeniation macropolycytes) are 
present regularly and early frequently be 
fore erythrocytic abnormalities become 
manliest Their presence is referred to as 
“shift to the right " Shift to the left or im 
matunty of white cells is also present with 
varying numbers of myelocytes and meta 
myelocytes and rarely even myeloblasts In 
untreated cases eosinophilia has been re- 
ported 

Platelets Thrombocytopenia is the rule 
m relapse Abnormal forms including giant 
platelets may be seen 

Abnormal cells have been descnbed in the 
mucosa of the mouth esophagus stomach 
and vagina in patients with macrocytic 
anemia (Graham and Rheault 1954)

rocytes survive normally In patients who 
have been adequately treated, but their sur- 
vival is shortened in untreated patients. 
Red cells of pabents yvith perrucious ane- 
mia survive normally in normal recipients. 

Marrow. In untreated patients or in re- 
lapse, megaloblastic hyperplasia is the 
characteristic finding. Nucleated red cells 
constitute up to 50 per cent of the nucleated 
count. Megaloblasts, characterized by their 
large size and finely reticulated nuclear 
chromatin resembling a network, are pres- 
ent. Their cytoplasm varies from deep blue, 
basophilic in the younger cells (promegalo- 
blasts), through light blue to orange and 
pink in the more mature cells (ortho- 
chromatic megalobiast). These colors may 
be diffuse or spotty (see p. 177>- 

Side by side tvith erythroid hyperplasia, 
myeloid n^etaplasia is the rule tvith hypo- 
trophy especially of the metamyelocytes and 
band cells. Both types of cells may be of 
giant size with poorly staining chromatin 


and with a basophilic cytoplasm shomng 
decreased granularity. 

The characteristic abnormal findings re- 
vert promptly to normal as soon as specific 
therapy is instituted. Various complications, 
including severe infections, may also affect 
the typical marrow findings. 

The lliochemical Abnonnality. The ab- 
sence of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric 
juice, even after injection of histamine, is a 
diagnostic finding The total amount of 
gastnc secretion is decreased and the en- 
zymes pepsin and renin are reduced or 
absent. These changes may precede the 
other signs of the disease. They are not 
affected by therapy. A small number of 
cases of clinical and hematologic per- 
nicious anemia but with free hydrochloric 
acid in the gastnc secretion have been re- 
ported (so-called achrestic anemia.) Tlie 
correct interpretation of such cases requires 
further studies to be mentioned later, such 
as assay of the patients gastric secretion.

Differential Diagnons Troptcat spnte. 
Blood findings are as follous Fretiuently 
macrocytic anemia is present, occasionally 
hypochromic microcytic, and rarely normo- 
cjtic Rarely anemia may be absent fn the 
macrocytic anemia, the peripheral blood and 
marrow findings are the same as m per* 
nicious anemia 

/diD/int/iic steatorrhea (iioitfro/ncnl 
s/jnie) and celiac disease Jn bolh diseases 
macrocytic or hypochromic nucrocytic or 
normocytic anemia may be present as a 
rule less severe than in pernicious anemia 
Macrocytic anemia is more common than 
microcytic in idiopathic steatorrhea but less 
frequent in cebac disease 

The marroiv is megaloblastic in macro- 
cytic anemia and normoblastic in mi 
crocytic In sprue and nontroplcal stea 
torrhea, iron deficiency may be present 
together vs^th vitamin B ,2 and folic acid 
deficiency This combination is more fre 
quent than in pernicious anemia Macro- 
cytosis and anisocjtosis may result in a 
normal M C V Iron therapy leads to macro- 
cytic anemia and liver therapy to micnicyrtic 
hypochromic anemia 

The Biochemical Defect Free HCl 
may be absent, but less frequently than in 
pernicious anemia and tends to respond to 
treatment The large bulk, the mushy ap- 
pearance, the bghi color, and the high fat 
content of the stool in sprue, idiopathic 


steatorrhea, and ceUac disease arc helpful 
m the differential diagnosis 

Nin-RiTiovAL MAcnocYTic Anemias 
Tropical Macrocyiic Anemia This Is 
a rather indefinite group, seen also in sub- 
tropical and temperate zones with oc 
casional iron deficienc) anemia superim 
posed In some cases, findings identical with 
those seen in pernicious anemia arc present 
In others, the findings charactenstic for 
iron deficiency are In the foreground 
Pellagra. The anemia which may be 
severe m less than 20 per cent of cases Is 
only rarely macrocytic In so-called "a! 
cohobc" pellagra, the anemia, if present, 
is frequently macrocytic 

Pernicious Anemia of Pregnancy- Tills 
should be differentiated from the more com 
mon, so-called physiologic anemia of preg 
nancy and from the iron deficiency anemia 
of pregnancy The charactenstic peripheral 
blood and marrow findings help in making 
the correct diagnosis The more 'uniform 
size and shape of the red cells in the pcriph 
eral blood may help to differentiate this con 
ditlon from true pernicious anemia Megalo- 
blastic marrow hyperplasia may be most 
impressive and impossible to distinguish 
from true pernicious anemia Free HCI is 
present more frequently than in true per 
nicious anemia FoUc acid is more effcciive 
than liver extract, and ora! administration 
of liver extract may help when it is not 
effective parcntcrally

An increased incidence of macrocytic 
anemia foUotvxng total gastrectomy and less

gastroenterostomy has been reported It 
has also been seen in patients wih in 
testinai strictures and anastomoses Macro 
cytic anemia resembhng pernicious ane 
mia may be seen in li\er disease Here the 
leukocytes look normal and the marrow is 
rarely megaloblastic Achlorhydria is less 
frequent than in patients with hepatic dis 
ease but without macrocytic anemia 

Fish tapeworm infestation is another con 
ditfon that was thought to be complicated 
occasionally by a pernicious anemia like 
picture in the blood and marrow and by 
central ner%ous system involvement Liver 
therapy is effective as is expulsion of the 
worm The present consensus is that a 
cause and effect association between the 
infestation and the blood disease is rare 
According to some writers the location of 
the tapeworm may be a factor Macrocytic 
anemia is supposed to be more frequent 
when the jejunum is infested than when 
the tapeworm is in the ileum According to 
some authors the coexistence of the in 
festalion and of the pernicious anemia is 
best explained by the simultaneous xnci 
dental presence of both condiuons

This is a progressive often fatal macro- 
cytic anemia closely resembhng pemiaous 
anemia but without certain of its features 
such as absence of central nervous system 
involvement Failure to respond to liver

soine individuals after single or repeated ex

damaging the marrow of animals as are the 
chemicals in the first group They include 
antimicrobial drugs (salvarsan chloram

streptomycin) anticonvulsants (Mesan

bimazole) antihistammics (Pyribenza

chemicals — some known (gold compounds 
atabnne chlorpromazine hair dyes bis 
muih mercury) and more to come 

Tomc Rcfraciory Vncrnia This is caused 
by a number of physical or chemical agents 
that produce marrow damage in all sub 
jects exposed to a sufficient dose including 
animals Here belong lomzmg radiation 
mustard compounds benzol and anu 
leukemic agents such as Myleran urethane 
and antimetaboUtes 

llcnzol Poisoning The changes in the 
blood frequently include anemia alone or in 
combination with leukopenia and thrombo- 
cytopenia Occasional changes eosino- 
philia leukocytosis and leukemoid reaction 
The marrou may vary from aplastic or 
hypoplastic to hyperplastic Occasionally 
extramedullar) hematopoiesjs may be pres 
eni with splenomegaly 

Organic Vrsenicals There is no appar 
ent relationship between the size of the 
dose the frequency or duration of exposure 
and the injury to the blood The various 
compounds differ in iheir effectiveness 

In the case of some drugs marrow dam 
age did not appear until the second or third 
course of therapy (e g chloraraphemcol) 

Ionizing Radiation The effects on blood 
cells depend on rhe radiosensKivrfy of the 
cells the capacity of the cells to regenerate 
and the survival rate of the cells in the 
peripheral blood 

The opimons regarding xadiosensitivity of 
blood cells differ A smgle therapeutic dose 
of 300 r to the sacroiliac joints and the 
whole length of the spine of patients with 
ankylosing spondylitis wasrollowed m a few 
hours by a rise of the neutrophilic granu 
locytes 

A drop of the lymphocytes was noted 
first after 24 hours and contmued for sev 
eral days The total white count began d^ 
creasmg on the first or second day mainly 
due to the effect on lymphocytes After five 
days the number of the granulocytes began 
falling The hematocnt had already begun 
to decrease at the end of the first or second 
day (Brown and Abbott 195o) 


Labor VTORV Methods 

The effects of massive exposure depend 
on the dose and sensitivity In the acute 
radiation syndrome systemic effects (pros 
tration fever) leukopenia and mfecdon 
may lead rapidly to death Or throm 
bocytopema and purpura may develop This 
form may lead to diarrhea dehydration m 
fection aplastic anemia hemorrhage and 
death m weeks The effect of radioacUve 
isotopes IS more gradual more persistent 
and longer lasting Late effects of ionizing 
radiation include leukemia 

Blood counts at regular intervals for per 
sons exposed occupationally to ionizing 
radiation have been recommended Accord 
ing to Wintrobe (1961) this pracUce has 
htUe to recommend it The use of film 
badges is more practical 

Other Causes of Refractorv AHEatiA 
The disease may be a terminal develop- 
ment in pernicious anemia granulocytic 
leukemia myelophthisic anemia miliary 
tuberculosis and occasionally m a vanety 
of other conditions A so-called pure red cell 
anemia with a normal leukocyte and platelet 
count combined with a thymoma was re

5im//<r C/irouic Aneima 

Definition The nondescript term refers 
to the most common type of anemia seen 
in various mfections and chronic systemic 
diseases and as a rule mild and over 
shadowed by the basic disease Occasionally 



The Blood

the basic disease may be. obscured by the 
anemia. This is especially frequent in 
chronic renal disease, cancer, subacute bac- 
terial endocarditis, hypothyroidism, and 
Addison’s disease. 

Blood. The anemia is normocytic, occa- 
sionally normochromic microcytic, the so- 
called “simple microcytic anemia" (Win- 
trobe. 1961). It is mild as a rule. There is 
no evidence of blood destruction or regenera- 
tion. Anisocytosis is slight and poikilocytosis 
insignificant. 

ilarrow. No hypoplasia is seen, hut 
actually and not infrequently there is granu- 
locytic hyperplasia tvith maturation arrest. 
Quantitative and qualitative erythroid hypo- 
plasia has been reported in severe renal 
insufficiency with azotemia above 150 mg. 
of nonprotein nitrogen per 100 ml. of blood. 
Even in such a case aplasia was not seen. 
Failure to respond to treatment, except via 
the underlying disease, is the main feature 
of this type of anemia. 

4netnta of Infeciion 

It occurs in two main forms: the acute, 
occasionally severe anemia of septicemia 
and the chronic mild anemia of chronic 
infection. The serum Iron is lowered and 
cot corrected by parenterally administered 
Iron. There are no signs of blood regenera- 
tion, indicating that the red cell formation 
is depressed. Studies on red cell survival 
showed increased destruction. 

Anemia of Renal Insufficiency 

Shortened survival of red cells has been 
reported with red cell production unable to 
li^ppsce. 

Myelophthisic Atiemia 

Definition. Anenua due to marrow re- 
placement by metastatic carcinoma, myelo- 
fibrosis (occasional cases of multiple 
myeloma), and a variety of other less well- 
defined conditions. 

Presence of varying numbers of normo- 
blasts and immature granulocytes is a char- 
acteristic finding, and is responsible for the 
synonyms “leukoerythroblastlc anemia" and 
"leukoeiythroblastosis.” 

In the anemia of myelofibrosis or mydo- 
sclerosis, splenomegaly is frequent and the 
course is slow. In the so-called “agnogenic 
myeloid metaplasia" the marrow shows 
various changes but they are not leukemic. 
The spleen shows widespread myeloid hyper- 
plasia. 


The Blood, l^ormocytic anemia of vary- 
ing severity is present-, occasionally there is 
macrocytic anemia. Many normoblasts are 
present in the peripheral blood as well as 
evidence of active red cell regeneration. The 
leukocyte counts vary. Leukocytosis and 
immature granulocytes may be seen in 
myelofibrosis, but they are rare in the pres- 
ence of cancer metastases. There is no 
lymphocytosis as it is seen in aplastic ane- 
mia. Thrombocytopenia may be present and 
atypical giant platelets are frequent. 

HEREDITARV 

HEMOGLOBINOPATHIES 

Definition. Diseases of the blood for 
which genetically determined physical- 
chemical properties of hemoglobin are re- 
sponsible. 

Histor)-. Chemical differences between 
fetal and adult hemoglobin have been 
known for over 100 years (Von Korber, 
1866). The immunologic differences be- 
tween the two hemoglobins were studied 
more recently (Darrow et al , 1940). A 
clinical entity belonging to this group, sickle 
cell anemia, was described by Herrick in 
1910. Pauling et al. (1949) opened a new 
fruitful field of investigation when they 
reported specific and characteristic proper- 
ties of siclde cell hemoglobin Their studies 
initiated a new approach to the study of 
human hemoglobms, which led to much in- 
formation of clinical Importance. More than 
J3 different varieties of hemoglobins have 
already been identified. Others have been 
announced and await identificatiDn, and un- 
doubtedly more will follow. 

Nomenclature. By agreement, capital let- 
rere of (he dlphahee are ctsed foe (heir ffeacs- 
fication in the order of discovery, except for 
those which had already been associated 
with a particular letter at the time when 
the new nomenclature was agreed upon. 
When two or more hemoglobins are involved 
in a s)’ndrome, the major is listed first,- the 
same preference is given to thalassemia. 

Biodiemistry. The genetically determined 
hemoglobin differences are located in the 
globin component of hemoglobin, not in the 
heme. So far, significant biochemical dif- 
ferences have been found in Hb F (fetal 
hemoglobin), specifically in the total amino 
acid composition as compared with Hb A 
(normal adult hemoglobin). In the other 
hemoglobms, the differences seem to be in 
amino acid arrangement or linkage or in 
substitution of one or more amino uicids for 
those usually found in Hb A. 



Clinical Diagnosis b\ 

In practically all hemoglobinopathies 
there is anemia of varying degrees The 
anemia is hemolyuc and the hemoglobin 
abnormahty is responsible Another finding 
common to most hemoglobmopathies is 
target cells in the peripheral blood Their 
numbers vary They are characteristic but 
not specific 


Idenlificalton of the Hemoglobrns 

Alkali Denaiuration Hb F is resistant to 
denaturation by lughly alkaline solutions by 
which all other human hemoglobms are 
destroyed This method is capable of de- 
tectmg Hb F if present m excess of 2 per 
cent of the total hemoglobin 

Paper Electrophoresis Proteins are elec 
tncaliy charged molecules and move at dif 
ferent rates of speed m an electric field 
Additional differences are related to the 
hydrogen ion concentration of the solution 
employed Most of the hemoglobins can be 
identified in this manner as shown in Figs 
4-51 4-52 

At pH 8 6 Hb C moves least and I and 
H move most The other hemoglobins move 
as follows (from less to more) £ O D 
and S same speed as D L G and F same 
speed as G A K J ! and H same speed as 
I

Genettes of Unman Hemo^lobtm 

The hemogJobm pattern of every person is 
determined by a pair of genes if they are 
identical the result is homozygosity if they 
are different heterozygosity The most com 
mon pattern is homozygous hemoglobin A 
in the normal adult The next in frequency 
is sickle cell trait with a mixture of hemo- 
globins A and S (from 22 to 46 per cent 
of the latter) In sickle cell anemia hemo 
globin S Is present alone or together wath F

genetic mechanism for Hb F is apparently present 
St aU times 

When more than one hemoglob n s present one 
of them predominates Hb A when combined with 
another hemoglobin usually is more than SO per 
cent of the total All hemoglobms suppress in vary 
ing degrees the expressivity of Hb F Especially 
in the presence of Hb A almost no F can be found 
butHbC D E and S suppress the P less effectively 
On the other band a thalassemia gene enhances 
the express vlty of Hb F and of any assoc ated ab- 
nor nal hemoglob n but suppresses Hb A Hence 
in thalassemia ma^or large amounts of F may be 
present with very 1 ttle A although A is presumably 
homozygous Also in thalassemia Ifb S disease up 
to 100 per cent of Hb S may be found although the

Chrome hemolytic anemia and episodes of 
pamful cnscs Continued and progressne

before the age of 30 is interrupted by two 
kinds of crises clinical (painful) without 
acute hematologic changes, and hemato 
logic Hematologic enses inch acute drop of 
red cells and hemoglobm are due to acute 
marrow aplasia wth persistent shortened 
survival of red cells 

Pathogenesis Hemoglobin S is freely 
soluble when oxygenated, but when reduced 
It forms elongated molecular masses, tac 
toids which are responsible for the distor 
tion of the cells into sickles and all the 
consequences The seienty of the chnicaf 
mamfestations is related to the amount of 
Hb S and to the mean corpuscular S hemo- 
globin concentration in the red cdls 

Blood Chrome normochromic normo- 
cytic anerma with a tendency to macrocy 
tosis and hyperchromia reticulocytosis, 
polychromatop^a large numbers of target 
cells (up to 30 per cent), normoblasts, and 
Howell Jolly bodies are seen regularly (Fig

lecomroended Three simple and one more 
sophisticated method employing a reducing 
agent will be desenbed 

1 A drop of capillary or venous blood 
(any anticoagulant may be used) is placed 
on a shde and immediately covered with : 
coversbp the edges sealed with petrolatum 
and the preparation meubated at room fem 
perature The preparation is examined foi

not less than 10 per cent of the cells art 
sickled A negative result does not exclud< 
sicklcnua because the red cells may lost 
their capacity to sickle before the oxygen

2 A drop of blood is allowed to fall int® 
a small tube containing 0 2 to 0 5 ml of a 
mixture of equal parts of physiologic salt 
solution and a 3 per cent solution of sodium 
citrate The blood is mixed thoroughly with 
the solution and a sufficient quantity ot 
parafiin oil is added to make a layer 1 cm 
thick No air bubbles must be trapped under 
the oil The preparation is left standuvg for 
24 hours Then 0 2 to 0 5 ml of a 10 per

method are illustrated in Figure 4-54 
When preparations are made by this 
method the results may he read immedi 
ately consequently this is the method of 
choice for routine work (Scnver and 
Waugh 1930)

PfiocEDURE A drop or two of the fresh 
reagent is added to a drop of blood (capU 


lary or venous) on a glass slide A cover 
glass is put on the slide Tlie excessn c blood 
IS expressed by gently pressing the co\cr 
glass with a piece of fUter paper Sealing 
and waiting is not necessary 
A similar preparation but iviih saline in 
stead of the reducing agent is set up as

immediately and if negative the slide should 
be reexamined at intervals The final read

Test for (Iifferenltalton belueeit sickle 
cell aiientta mirf trait Principle In sickle 
cell anemia sickling takes place at a con 
siderably higher oxygen pressure than in 
the trait Equihbration of a blood sample 
at 37° C with a gas mixture of oxygen (4 
per cent) nitrogen (86 per cent) and 
carbon dioxide (10 per cent) will produce 
sickling of 90 per cent or more of red 
cells in sickle cell anemia but of less than 
10 per cent in the trait 

The Test Four milliliters of venous 
blood with an anticoagulant are placed in 
a large test tube or small Erlenmeyer bottle 
closed with a stopper contaimng a rubber 
diaphragm The gas mixture is passed 
through tte blood for three minutes while 
the containers are rotated The bottle is 
shaken gently for 15 minutes at 37® C 

One tenth to 0 5 ml of blood is trans 
ferred without exposure to the air into 3 
ml of 10 per cent of formalin (1 part of 37 
per cent formaldeh>de in water and 9 parts 
of aqueous NaCl 0 85 gm per 100 ml ) 
This fixes the red cells and prevents reversal 
of the sickling on exposure to ox>gen A 
drop of the red cell suspension is examined 
under the microscope 

Interpretation Less than 10 percent 
of red cells sickle in the trait whereas 90 
pet cent do in the anemia The test will dif 
ferentiate the two conditions It also permits 
the correct diagnosis in a paUent who re- 
ceived a recent blood transfusion 

Electrophoredc anal} sis does not permit 
the correct diagnosis of sickle cell anemia 
in a patient with a recent transfusion but

the peripheral blood. The marrow, hemolytic 
index, and red cell survival studies partdlel 
the clinical picture. Hb C and Hb S occur in 
about equal amounts. Hb F ranges from 
normal to 7 per cent. 

Sickle cell-Hb D Disease. Little is knovm^ 
too few cases have been described. 

Clinical findings. These range from 
mild to moderate. In the latter case, they 
may resemble sickle cell-Hb C disease. 

Electrophoresis. The pattern is indis- 
tinguishable from sickle cell anemia, be- 
cause Hb S and Hb D cannot be distin- 
guished on paper electrophoresis. Solubility 
studies and family investigation reveal the 
true nature of the condition. 

The less known sickle cell-Hb G, Hb C- 
Hb C disease and sickle cell Hb E disease 
have been described but are not well studied. 

/ IThalassemia 

This term comprises a group of hereditary 
diseases resulting from multiple interre- 
lated genetic defects in people of Mediter- 
ranean, African, and Asian ancestry. 

Principle. There is a defect In corpuscular 
structure and in iron utilization. The de- 
fective hemoglobin is A or F. 

Blood findings range from very mild, 
even asymptomatic, and di/Hculc to diagnose 
to severe chronic microcytic hypochromic 
hemolytic anemia. There may be a possible 
genetic reladonship between the thalas- 
semia gene or genes and Hb F. 

In families of patients with thalassemia, 
high levels "of Hb F up to 80 per cent were 
found with only minimal clinical manifesta- 
tions of thalassemia. 

According to the present consensus thal- 
assemia major is homozygous, and thalas- 
semia minor (thalassemia trait) is hetero- 
zygous. 

At'least six different abnormal hemoglo- 
bins have been found in thalassemia: Hb 
S. C,E, D, H, and G. 

Thalassemia Major (Homozygous Thal- 
assemia, Cooley's Anemia). Clinical findings. 
Severe hemolytic anemia. Prominent facial 
bones, slanting eyes, and icterus add up to 
the “mongoloid facies.” Splenomegaly. 

X-ray. Thinning of the cortex of long 
and flat bones from marrow hyperplasia. 
Skull thickened and osteoporotic. “Hair on 
end” appearance. 

Blood. Microcytic hypochromic anemia, 
reticulocytosis. target cells, ovalocytosis, ex- 
treme poikilocftosis with bizarre shapes, 
Cabot rings, Howell-JoUy bodies, nuclear 
fragments, siderocytes, anisocytosis, aniso-

4—1. 4— 5[6}). Indirect serum bilirubin 
and serum hemoglobin are elevated. Os- 
motic resistance is increased. 

Morroii'. Normoblastic hyperplasia. 
Electrophoresis. Hb F is increased up to 
90 per cent. Hb F can he measured with 
paper electrophoresis, chromatography, im^ 
munologic tests, or aJkali-denaturation test 
(Singer ef al, 1951 ). 

Hb Aa (“trace” hemoglobin) is increased 
(Gerald and Diamond, 1958; Kunkel and 
Wallenius, 1955). Best demonstrated with 
starch-block electrophoresis. 

Thalassemia Minor (Heterozjgous Thal- 
assemia; Thalassemia Minima; Cooley's

Anemia in Pregnancy 
Irov Deficiency Anemia 
Moderate normochromic normocytlc ane 
mia m pregnancy is the rule rather than 
the exception Some writers call it physio- 
logic It has been reported in 88 per cent 
of pregnant women A vanety of factors con 
tnbute to this situation Prlmiparas may 
enter their childbearing career with an Iron 
deficiency brought on by periodic blood 
losses in menstruation, which may be ag 
gravated by dieting and faulty food habits 
In multiparous women the deficiency is in 
creased by further loss of iron in each sue 
cessne pregnancy and lactation The iron 
requirements dunng a pregnancy amount to 
about 725 mg This requires correction for 
the amount of iron that would have been 
lost with each menstruation The fetus de 
mes Its Initial iron stores from the raoiher 
Another factor is the plasma volume 
which IS normal dunng the first trimester, 
nses slightly dunng the second and may 
reach a level 40 per cent above normal 
in the third tnmester All this adds to a 
slightly lower hemoglobin to begin with (14 
gm i 0 5 gm ), an average of 13 gm (— 

1 gm ) in the second tnmester, and an avtr 
age of 12 gm (i 1 gm ) in the third 
Red cell values of about 3 500 000 and 
hematocrit readings of about 33 per cent 
have been reported Temporary increases of 
blood values have been recorded in the third 
tnmester (thirty second to thirty fourth 
weeks) Following delivery the antepartum

Megaloblastic Anemia 

The incidence of this form shows striking 
geographic differences It Is less frequent in 
the United States than in England It is 
seen frequently in India and in the tropics 
especially in advanced pregnancy and eirly 
after childbirth more often in young muUi 
paras under 35 years of age and in women 
with poor dictar> habits Marrow exnmina 
tion IS needed for the diagnosis especially 
when clear-cut iron deficiency is absent 
It may be indicated even in the presence of 
low hemoglobin values because combined 
megaloblastic and iron deficiency anemias 
may exist Albuminuna and purpura may 
also be present

to but not identical with that seen in true

Polycythemia T era 

Clinical rindmgs Affected patients ex 
hibit a peculiar and striking cyanotic 
countenance There is a tendency to throm 
bosis Splenomegaly is present in the 
majority of patients and is accepted as 
diagnostic The liver is enlarged but less 
frequently The disease is somewhat more 
frequent in men It begins in middle age 
the prevalence is highest after 50 It is 
known to occur in combination with hyper 
tension (Gaisbocks syndrome) and with 
hepatic cirrhosis (Mosses syndrome) 


Pathogenesis The pathogenesis has not 
been established None of the suggested ex 
planations have prevailed It is considered 
as one of the myeloprolife ative disorders 
This fits well with the abnormal prolifera 
tion of all three marrow elements with 
resulting findings in the marrow and penph 
eral blood 

The erythrocytes of the circulating blood 
number 7 000 000 to 12 000 000 per cubic 
millimeter Erythrocyte counts of more than 
1 5 000 000 have been recorded The value 
for the hemoglobin ranges from 18 to 24 
gm per 100 ml of blood The M C V 
M C H and M C H C are normal or low 
In the cases with excessively high numbers 
of erythrocyte*- the cells are abnormally 
small otherwise the cellular volume would 
exceed that of the whole blood As would 
be expected the total volume of the blood 
is usually increased It may be two to three 
times greater than normal The increase is 
brought on by a nse in the total erythrocyte 
mass and correspondingly m the hematoent 
Resistance of the erythrocytes to hypotonic 
saline solutions is increased The viscosity 
of the blood is high and it may be difficult 
to prepare good smears The blood coagu 
btes rapidly The E S R is reduced The 
platelet count is usually above the normal 
average sometimes 1 million and more 
Macrocytes microcytes polychromatophilic 
erythrocytes and normoblasts may be found 
but are not a prominent feature of the dis 
case Moderafe polymotphonuclear neufro 
philic leukocytosis is the rule and a num 
her of these pauents may show a leukemoid 
reaction with immature granulocytes and 
normoblasts Large masses of platelets may 
be seen Alkaline phosphatase is greatly in 
creased with values up to 200 

The marrow shows general hyperplasia 
of all cell types In some cases especially 
late in the disease the myeloid cells in 
cludmg the basophils probferate most ac 
tively Occasionally myelofibrosis sets m 

Complications Leukemia may develop 
late in the disease an incidence of 20 to 
80 per cent has been reported (Miaie

HEMATOPOIESIS IN THE NEWBORN 
AND INFANT 

In the seven to-ten week old (18 to 38 
mm long) embiyo about 25 per cent of 
the circulating red cells are nucleated At 
the intrauterine age of four or five months 
(length 160 to 2o0 mm ) the number of 
nucleated red cells is reduced to less than 
1 per cent It has been reported that the 
number of erythrocytes increases with the 
progression of pregnancy by about 500 000 
every four weeks from I mdhon per cu 
mm at eight weeks of intrauterine life 
(Fruhiing et al 1949) In addiuon to age 
other factors prenatal and postnatal in 
fiuencE the hltiod pictvne 

1 One such factor IS size In single ovum 
twms with common placental circulation 
differences in body weight are reflected In 
corresponding differences in the numbers of 
erythrocytes and levels of hemoglobin for 
example 25 gm of hemoglobin and 
7 500 000 erythrocytes in the larger twin 
and 3 7 gm and 1 800 000 erythrocytes in 
the smaller (Klxngberg et al lOaS)

maternal circulation fs evidenced by the 
presence of elev ated amounts of fetal hemo- 
globin in the maternal circulation of anemic 
mfants (O Connor et al 1957) 

3 At the time of clamping the cord as 
much as 100 to 125 ml of placental blood 
ma> be added to the newborn If tying of 
the cord is postponed until the pulsation 
of the cord ceases In a stud> of newborns 


whose cords had been clamped late the 
capillary red ceU counts were 
400 000 higher one hour after and 800 000 
higher 24 hours after birth as compared 
with newborns whose cord had b«n 
clamped earl) (DeMarsh et cl 1941 1948) 

4 Capillary blood (obtained b) skin 
pnek) gives higher red cell and hemoglobin 
values than venous (cord sinus) The dif 
ferences may amount to about oOO 000 for 
the former and about 3 0 gm for the latter 
The slowing of capillary circulaUon and 
the resulting loss of fluid may be the rc 
sponsible factor Examination of venous 
blood fumishesmore consistent results than 
capillar) 

5 Dramatic changes take place In the 
blood and marrow during the first few days 
and even dunng the early hours after binli 
These are reflected in the values of all 
formed elements and in the rapid fluctua 
tions The number of erythrocytes tends to 
reach a peak during the first 24 hours it 
mams at this plateau for about two weeks 
and then declines slowly 

The calculated average of 480 cr)'throc)tc 
counts in capillary blood was reported as 
5 640 000 With a range of 3 500 000 to 
8 230 000 The calculated average of 219 
counts in venous blood was 4 820 000 with 
a range of 3 100 000 to 6 850 000 (Smith 
1959) Both compilations were based on 
examinations done during the first postnatal 
day It is apparent that the high counts arc 
seen mainly in capillary blood whereas 
values obtained fn venous blood are nor 
sjgmficantl) different from what one finds 
in health) older children 

Nucleated red cells are most numerous 
at b«Vh VfWh S per 100 whUe blood cells 
in the cord blood at term and ^5 per cent 
in premature infants at 24 weeks (Fruhiing 
1949) In full term Infants the number o* 
normoblasts declines rapidly to about I pci 
cent during the first 24 hours The normal 
reticulocyte count at birth ranges from 1 
to 6 per cent during the first 24 hours It 
may nse somevvhat during the first few 
hours and decline beginning with the iWrd 
day to about 1 to 3 per cent (Gafrdner ct al 
1952 Seip 1955) 

The calculated average of 526 hemo- 
globin tests in capillary blood during the 
first 24 hours was reported as 19 So gm 
with a range of 12 3 to 27 5 gm S milady 
the calculated average of 289 tests on 
venous blood was reported as 170 gm vdin 
a range of 12 5 to 24 6 gm (Smith 19o9) 
There Is frcquentl) an Initial Increase In 



The Blood 201 


the hemoglobin Ie\el of \enQus blood at the 
end of 24 hours as compared with that of 
cord blood The level remains constant for 
about three days It is followed by a drop 
beginning with the fourth day becoming 
more pronounced during the second week 
and continuing untd anemia is present 
normally in the second and third months 

The hematocrit ranges from 46 to 60 
per cent in cord blood at birth It is lower in 
prematures Smith quoted 42 S per cent in 
sn month prematures with monthly in 
creases of about 3 per cent and an average 
of 53 per cent In newborns at term After 
birth Oiere is usually an increase during the 
first 45 hours followed by a slow but con 
tinuous decline down to about 46 per cent 
after two weeks and about 35 per cent be 
tween the second and fourth months 

Macrocjtosis is usually present at birth 
The average mean corpuscular volume 
(M C V ) IS about 100 cu microns A sharp 
drop takes place during the first 24 hours 
Tlie drop continues at a less rapid pice to 
reach about 82 cu microns at six months 
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (M C H ) 
shows a similar course 37 at birth 
34 nfig at 20 days and 26 at six 
months Average mean corpuscular hemo- 
globin concentration (M C H C ) In cord 
blood was reported as about 33 gm per 100 
ml of erythrocytes with a slight nse to 
about 34 gra between the first and tenth 
days to 35 gm at two months and a slow 
but steadv decline to a mmimum level dur 
mg the second year (Guest and Brown 
1957) 

The high erythrocytic values at birth are 
explained b) the stimulating effect on the 
marrow of the partial anoxia in utero 
which becomes more progressive with the 
growth of the fetus With the change in the 
environment and improved oxygenation 
after birth the stimulus to blood production 
ceases abruptly with resulting lowering of 
all the erythrocytic values and later a more 
gradual development of a "physiologic" ane 
mia The role of hypoxia is Illustrated by 
reports of continued high erythrocyuc values 
m the neonatal period in infants with con 
genual heart disease These infants do not 
develop “physiologic” anemia (Rudolph et 
al 1953) 

Another factor that contnbutes to the 
lowered values is the shortened survjval 
of neonatal erythrocytes (HalUngsworth 
1955) 

There are conflicting reports in the htera 
ture regarding osmotic resistance of fetal 


blood but the consensus is that it is not 
signifutantly different from the resistance 
In later life The evidence in favor of 
lowered mechanical resistance of fetal blood 
Is slightly more convmcing 

The II btte Blood Cells 

The total white cell count at birth and 
dunng the first 24 hours vanes within 
wide limits The numbers range from 4000 
to 40 000 granulocytes being the pre 
dominant cell and a large proport 2 on of 
them being nonsegmented with occasional 
myelocytes and without evidence of djs 
ease According to most oplmons there are 
increases of the total number and of the 
granulocytes dunng the first 24 hours The 
count begms to drop progressively at the 
beginning of the second day mainly owing 
to a decrease of granulocytes According 
to a careful study by Forkner (1929) dur 
ing the first day the average was a total 
white cell count of 25 000 with 69 per cent 
neutrophilic granulocytes 2 per cent eosmo 
phlls 7 per cent monocytes 18 per cent 
lymphocytes and 4 per cent myelocytes 
Ten days later the corresponding figures 
were 13 000 29 per cent 3 per cent 17 
per cent 49 per cent and 0 2 per cent 

In premature Infants examined on the 
first day the total white cell count is usually 
lower (average about 7500) The number 
of immature white cells in the differential 
count Is higher and the replacement of 
granulocytes by lymphocytes lakes place 
somewhat later than in term infants 

The dramatic variations in the total white 
cell count and in the differential count sug 
gest caution in correlating such findmgs 
with clinical manifestations of disease The 
platelet count is in the lower normal range 
at birth and dunng the first week and then 
rises rapidly to adult levels 

DISEASES A^^XCTI^G LEUKOCYTES 

The examination of leukocytes includes 
two technical phases In the quantitative 
phase one determines the number of all the 
white cells the total white blood count 
(WBC) and the relative and absolute num 
bers of the vanous forms of white cells In 
the qualitative phase one determines tJie 
deviations from the normal in appearance 
and structure of the cytoplasm and nuclei 
Examination also includes two anatomic 
phases examination of penpheral blood 
(capillary or venous) and exammation of

or spinous process) 

The purpose of the study of ]euI>^ocytes 15 
first to help m estabhshmg a riia gnnq^ 
Occasionally the examination alone may 
furmsh a positive specific diagnosis for e:t 
ample in leukemia Alore frequently it may 
be diagnostically helpful together with other 
chnical or laboratory data for example in 
acute appendicitis or infectious mononucle 
osis Another purpose is to help in estab- 
lishing a prognosis For example a low 
white blood count in acute appendicitis or 
pneumoma is considered prognostically up 
f a\ orable 

Finally study of the leukocytes is helpful 
m following the course of disease For ex 
ample toxic effects of radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy may be recognized early by 
examination of ieulocytes 

Examination of leukocytes may also re 
veal the existence of an entirely unsus 
pected disease For example leukemia may 
be found m a patient with the cluuca] 
picture of an acute infection or infectious 
mononucleosis may he found m patients 
whose disease clinically resembles leukemia 
For this and other reasons the white blood 
count IS one of the so-called routine tests 
which according to recommendations of 
organizations supennsmg hospitals have 
to be done on every patient admitted to the 
hospital regardless of disease 

The yiormal H hite Blood Count 

For techmques employed in the study of 
leukocytes see p 103ff 

According to studies with radioactive 
phosphorus and labeled thymidine neu 
trophilic and eosmophihc granulocytes re 
mam m the marrow for four to six days 
before entenng the penpheral blood where 
their average survival is 9 to 13 days with 
a maximum of 21 days (Ottesen 1954) 
Tlie survival of lymphocytes is 100 to 200 
days (Christensen and Ottesen 1955) 

It is generally agreed that a while blood 
count falling vvithm the range of 5000 to 
10 000 per cu mm is withm normal limits 
By this IS meant that a study of large num 
hers of apparently healthy mdividuals 
showed that 80 per cent of them had white 
blood counts rangmg between the two val 
ues mentioned About one person in five 
will have a count either higher or lower 
than the mentioned values If 95 per cent 
of those tested were included as nonnals 
the range would be 4000 to 11 000 Accord 


Laboratory Methods 

mg to the best judgment of the examiners 
the 20 per cent beyond the 80 per cent 
range showed no perceptible signs of ab- 
normahty or illness 

Some factors responsible for this wide 
range of normal are known but many more 
are not known For example it is known 
that the condition of the host plays an im 
portant part as was shown by Garrey and 
Bryan (1935) According to their studies 
the upper limits of normal under basal 
conditions are 3000 to 4000 cells per cu 
mm 

After the first few years of hfe most of 
the white blood cells are granulocytes 
which are produced in the bone marrow 
Therefore the condition of the bone marrow 
and the release mechamsm both variables 
have a bearmg on the total number of white 
blood cells It seems that the release of the 
granulocytes from the bone marrow occurs 
at regular intervals The highest total count 
and the highest number of neutrophibc 
leukocytes are seen late m the afternoon 
This IS known as diurnal vanation The 
conception that food intake influences the 
total white count has been given up at 
least as it concerns the normal individual 
The influence of allergy will be discussed 
later 

Basal conditions and prolonged rest lower 
the white blood count Muscular activity 
especially if excessive raises the total white 
count As a rule the increase is in granulo- 
cytes sometimes in lymphocytes It has been 
shown that during exerase the spleen tends 
to contract excessively It is possible that 
this causes an increase of the penpheral 
white blood count by expelling the stored 
blood and leukocytes with it Cold showers 
or massage may raise the white blood count 
up to 25 000 Mental factors such as pain 
may produce leukocytosis 

There is no evadence that sex influences 
the white blood count except in the last 
month of pregnancy when vanations from 
the normal seem to be exaggerated and 
dunng labor when there is as a rule a 
sinking increase in the total white count 
ranging from 15 000 to 30 000 It lasts a 
few days and returns to normal after four 
days to two weeks post partum 

Age IS one of the important factors influ 
encing the white blood count quantitatim} 
and quahtaUvely Fluctuations of 
blood cells are common at all ages but tbev 
are greatest m infants and only shghtjy 
less so m childhood 

In the newborn baby the average count 


The Blood 


203 


is quoted as 15,000 with occasional values 
as high as 45,000 and a rapid drop on the 
second day continuing until about the 
tenth day. Nucleated red blood cells in the 
newborn, especially in the premature, may 
cause errors in leukocyte counts if proper 
corrections are not made. After ten days, 
until the age of about seven years, the range 
is 4500 to 15,500. This range is narrowed 
to 4000 to 13,000 in the age period of 8 
to 18 years. From then on the values quoted 
for adults prevail (Table 4-7).

Variations similar to those for the total 
white blood count also prevail with regard 
to the relative proportions of the differeni 
white blood cells, the so-called differential 
blood count (Table 4-8). According to 
Wlntrobe the range of neutrophilic granu- 
locytes in adults is 54 to 62 per cent. Ac- 
cording to Osgood, in the newborn the aver- 
age is 60 per cent on the first day; it drops 
to 38 per cent on the fifth day and continues 
approximately at the same level tvith a 
range of 16 to 60 per cent. In adolescents, 
the average increases to 48 per cent and 
the range to 25 to 70 per cent. 

Band cells are found in 0 to 5 per cent 
of white blood cells in the adult. As high 
as 25 per cent occur in the newborn infant 
during the first day of life; they increase 
up to 17 per cent during the first year of 
life and then slowly reach the values seen 
in the adult. Values over 10 per cent in the 
differential count are abnormal. 

Eosinophils range from 1 to 5 per cent 
with an average of 3 per cent in adolescents 
and adults. The values are slightly higher 
in children. 

Basophils are rare: they range from 0 to 
1 per cent. 

Normal values for lymphocytes in adults 


range from 20 to 40 per cent of the white 
blood cells. In the newborn the average is 
30 per cent on the first day witii a slow 
rise up to 45 per cent on the fourth day. 
Until the. age of 14 years the average is 
48 per cent and the range, 20 to 70 per 
cent. The average drops to 42 per cent and 
the range to 22 to 62 per cent in ado- 
lescents. 


Prevalence of lymphocytes over neutro- 
philic leukocytes may sometimes continue 
far beyond the age mentioned and into 
adult life. The reason for persistence of 
infantile lymphocytosis is unknonm, 

Monocytes are quoted as averaging 4 per 
cent of white blood cells in adolescents and 
adults with a range of 1 to 6 per cent, an 
average of 5 per cent, with a range of 0 
to 12 per cent in newborn and infants up 
to 4 years of age, and an average of 3 per 
cent and a range of 0 to 7 per cent In 
children 4 to 13 years of age- 

The tvfde range of variations In the total 
white blood count and in the relative pro- 
portions of the difTeteni white cells makes it 
apparent that relative figures expressed in 
percentages are of limited value and fre- 
quently misleading. Therefore, it is im- 
portant to calculate and to use the absolute 
values of these cells per cubic milUmeter. 
Familiarity with and use of absolute values 
help to prevent erroneous conclusions. The 
finding of 10 per cent lymphocytes in a dif- 
ferential count would at first suggest reduc- 
tion in the number of these cells but as- 
sumes an entirely different aspect when it 
is expressed in absolute numbers of a total 
white count of 25,000. The absolute values 
are listed in Table 4-8. The absolute values 
are calculated from the total white count 
and the percentage according to the for- 
mula: 

WBC 

Absolute no. = Xpercentofcelhype 

For example, total WBC = 20,000 
of eosinophils = 12

In addition to the study of the numbers 
of leukocytes of the three types (granulo- 
cytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes)— the 
quantitative study — evaluation of the blood

of the cells— the qualitative study. From

given to cells of the granulocyte senes 
Several methods of classifying granulocytes 
according to the degree of maturation have 
been suggested Ameth (1904) was the first 
to attempt practical prognostic evaluation 
of granulocytes by dmdmg them into fi\e 
classes according to the number o? seg 
ments Band cells and cells younger than 
these form Class I The other classes are 
determined by the presence of two three 
four and five segments About 35 per cent 
of the segmented cells have two segments 
41 per cent three segments 17 per cent 
four segments and not more than 2 per 
cent have five segments which is the high 
est number of segments m normal granuJo 
cytes 

Ameth worked out an elaborate but im 
practical system of grading In addition to 
Its complexity the weakness of the Ameth 
system was emphasis on classification of 
segmented cells which are prognostlcally 
least important 

Schilling's differential count enjoys the 
greatest popularity (Schillmg 3929) The 
granulocytes are ^vided according to their 


age in four groups myelocytes and 
younger cells metamyelocytes bands and 
segmented cells In normal blood myelocytes 
are absent and metamyelocytes may be seen 
occasionally The frequency of the other 
ceUs IS shown in Table 4-8 In hemograms 
(graphic presentations o£ difTeit'nba\ 
counts) the cells are usually listed from 
left to right in order of increasing maturity 
therefore an increase of immature forms 
IS spoken of as a “^shift to the left ” 

A “shift to the left" or an increase of 
immature granulocytes in the differential 
count means inability of the marrow to 
produce or release enough mature granulo- 
cytes in response to an excessive demand 
Instead immature cells are sent out as sub- 
stitutes Tins myeloid or marrow insufR 
ciencj IS usually temporary The shift to 
left may be “regenerative" if the total count 
is high and mature cells are present in 
ample numbers or “degenera tiie" if 
count is normal or low the mature cells 
are below normal numbers and the nucld 
of the immature cells are shrunken ana 
pyknotic I e show signs of degeneration

Basophilia of the cytoplasm and vacuoli 
zation are other signs of toxic damage 

A so-called degenerative index based 
upon the number of segmented granulo- 
cytes showing basophilic granules was pro- 
posed b} Kugel and nosenthal f 1932) It is 
computed by dividing the total number of 
neutrophils into the total number of cells 
With toxic granules For example if the 
total percentage of neutrophils is 75 and 
55 of them show basophilic granulation 
then 73 per cent show this change and the 
degenerative index is 73 The higher the 
index the more serious the prognosis 'The 
quality of the stain has an important bear 
mg on the appearance of the granulocytes 


Toxic granulation may be simulated by 
artifacts caused by imperfect staining It 
may also be confused with basophilic 
granules The latter are uniform and dark 
blue Toxic granules are smaller and black

of micrococci or a little larger some of them 
arc pear shaped others appear as short rods 
or cocci lying in pairs Smaller discrete 
punciiform granules are sometimes seen 
but do not hive the same significance It 
now seems well established that typical in 
elusion bodies have some diagnostic value 
They apparently are found in mmy or even 
Jn the mijonty of the polyTnorphonuclcar 
neutrophilic leukocytes in every case of 
scarlet fever early in the disease A few may 
be found in diphtheria pneumonii and 
some other infectious diseases but never m

relation to the total white blood count un 
less a proportionately large number of cells 
IS counted In other words the higher the 
total white count the larger the number of 
cells that must be counted to obtain an 
accurate differential count The following 
table has been found useful 
Normal— 100 cells 
Leukocytosis— 200 or 300 cells 
Leukemias— 500 cells 


Marroiv 

The total weight of the marrow m the 
adult IS about 2600 gm which is more than 
the weight of any other organ except circu 
lating blood skeletal muscles and bones 
Approximately one half of marrow is func 
tiomng red marrow the remainder is space 
occupying yellow fatty marrow 

Fat marrow may be replaced at any time 
by functiomng marrow This change may 
occur at an astoundingly rapid rate espe- 
cially in the young That explains the ex 
treme changes that may be seen in the 
peripheral blood on sbght proi ocauons 
especially in the young 

Vge In the newborn only red marrow is 
present With growth recession of red mar 
row takes place from the distal ends of the 
extremities (centripetal) In the normal 
adult red marro^N is found only in bones of 
trunk skull and proximal ends of femur 
and humerus In hyperplasia the trans 
formation of fat to red marrow progresses in 
centrifugal direction 

Maturation Erythrocytes grow in inter 
sinusoidal capiUanes which can open to 
the general circulation but which normally 
are closed until the cells reach a certain 
stage of maturation IVhen that is reached 
the capillary reopens into general circula 
tion and the cells are throivn out as reticu 
locytes of which there is normally about 
1 per cent It is probable that in cases of 
special need — for example loss of blood in 
large quantities — the release or the washing 
out of the intersinusoidal capiUanes takes 
place before the cells mature The formation 
of granulocytic cells is extrasinusoidal It 
IS assumed that they get into the ciicula 
tion by ameboid motion This is not present 
in myeloblasts and progranulocytes but is 
present in increasmg degrees m myelocytes 
and metamyelocytes (Plate 4-8) 

Marrow Changes 

Hyperplasia Hyperplasia may be defined 
as an increase of cellular marrow at the 


Laborator\ Methods 

expense of fat marrow In extreme degrees 
even bone may be replaced by probferatlnc 
marrow cells (osteoporosis) 

Hj^ierplasia may involve all marrow com 
ponents (general hyperplasia) or only one 
(for example granuloc)tic hyperplasia) 
or any combination of them Hyperplasia 
may also be generahzed and imohe most 
or many bones or may be local and bmlted 
to one region or bone Hj^jerplasUc marrow 
may consist of fully differenUated cells or 
of cells arrested at \ anous stages of matura 
tion The penpheral blood may reflect the 
hyperplasia of marrow by showing a cor 
responding mcrease of fully differentiated 
or immature ceDs (marrow hyperplasia with 
normal marrow blood threshold) orthehy 
perplasia of the marrow may not be mam 
fest by a corresponding increase in the cir 
culating blood (marrow hj-perplasia iv1th 
elevated marrow blood threshold) 

Hjpoplasia Hjpoplasfa may be defined 
as a decrease of cellular marrow and re 
placement by fat connective tissue bone 
metastauc cancer mabgnant lymphoma 
Hodgkins disease or multiple myeloma 
Hypoplasia of marrow may or may not te 
accompanied by pancytopenia 

All elements of marrow may be affected 
(general marrow hypoplasia) or only one 
or any combination of them Excessne h) 
perplasia of one or more marrow elements 
may be responsible for hypoplasia of the 
others For example in granulocytic leu 
kemia the granulocj tes may be hyperplastic 
to the extent of interfermg with the normal 
grmvth of red blood cells and megakarjo- 
c>tes wth resulung anemia and thrombo- 
cytopema 

Aplasia Aplasia may be defined as an 
extreme degree of general marrow h)po- 
plasia

iNfFCTlOVS LtVKOCYTOSIS 

The characteristic pattern of Infectious 
leukocytosis is made up of three component 
pans progressive neutrophilic leukocytosis 
(ncutrophliic phase) increase of young 
forms (shift to left) and drop of eosinophils 
— all time reaching their peak when the 
Infection is at its peak When the infection 
bcUns to subside and the fever drops a 
gradual transformation in the blood picture 
takes place the total number of leukocytes 
goes down and the number of monocytes 
increases (the monocytic phase of infcc 
tIon) A relative lyinphtxiyiosis (lyanpho 
cytic phase) and an increase of eosinophils 
are signs of advancing recovery 
The neutrophilic phase represents the 
period of active resistance to infection 
When (he process of defense Is finished and 
tl e peak is passed the monocytic phase fol 
lows and the end phase or the phase of re 
covery Is lymphocytic One could also say 
that the fight against the infection is char 
acierizcd by nt-UtrophiUa overcoming of the 
infection by monocytosis and healing by 
lymphocytosis 

Leukocytic monocytic and lymphocytic 
reactions may occur without infection m a 
variety of circumstances such as severe 
muscular exertion menstruation during 
ane&tlicsia and operations following per 
spiration in baths at high temperature fol 
lowing exposure to high temperatures in

circumstances are known to produce severe 
■neutropenias (benzol sulfonamides ars 
phenamine) 

rosthemorrhagic Iseutroplulia This may 
occur especially if hemorrhage has taken 
place into a serous cavity (pentoneum 


pleura joint subdural space) Leukocytosis 
following a Tiemorrhage into the lumen of 
an intestine also belongs In this category 

Leukocytosis following intracranial hem 
orrhage is probably caused at least in part 
by increased intracranial piessure In some 
cases of posthemorriiagic neutrophilic leu 
kocytosis rapid absorption of a chemo 
tactically active component of the blood is 
incriminated 

NcutropJuha due to Tissue Destruction 
Here belongs neutrophlba following injec 
tions of turpentine m myocardial infarc

after rapid hemolysis of red cells in hemo 
lytic crises of hemolytic anemia and in

Determinants of Neutrophilic

Host Tactors 1 Age Children respond 
more intensely and more rapidly to a leuko 
cytogcnic stimulus than adults 

2 Resistance An 111 defined property fre 
quently highly specific for a certain micro 
organism 

3 Marrow e/Ticiency or reserve Capacity 
of the marrow lo respond rapidly and effi 
cicntly to leukocyiogenic stimuh 

4 Localizing ability of body m response 
to Invasion by infectious agents The mote 
localized the process the more pronounced 
the neutrophilia and vice versa 

The Infectious Vgcni 1 Specific leuko 
cytogenic properties of microorganisms 
cspectaUypyogenic bacteria 

2 Virulence of microorganisms There is 
within limits a direct relationship between 
virulence of the infecting microorganism 
and the degree of neutrophilia This prop- 
erty IS frequently conditioned by the spread 
ing ability or invasiveness of the microor 
gantsm as opposed to the locahzmg ability 
of the host 

A highly virulent microorganism endowed 
with a high degree of invasiveness may pro 
duce only a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis 
even with a severe infection 

It is claimed and it is probably correct 
withm wide limits that the height of leuko 
cytosis IS an indicator of the resistance of 
the individual and that the degree of the 
shift to the left is an indicator of the sever 
ity of the infection In keeping with this 
conception a simultaneous fall of the for 
itier and a rise of the latter are prognosti 
cally unfavorable 



210 Clinical Diagnosis by 

Prognostic conclusions in the study of 
leukocytes can be drawn from quantitative 
data, such as height of leukocyte count, 
decrease in number of eosinophils, number 
of lymphocytes (see Hodgkin’s disease), and 
number of monocytes in relation to lympho- 
cytes (see tuberculosis) and from quidita- 
tive data, such as a shift to left and toxic 
granulation of leukocytes. 

The followng are hematologic signs of 
recovery from infectious diseases: 

1. Drop of the total leukocyte count and 
of the number of neutrophils. 

2. Disappearance of shift to the left. 

3. Increase in number of monocytes (ex- 
cept in tuberculosis; see p 223). 

4. Increase of eosinophils when they were 
decreased or absent during the height of 
the disease. 

5. Increase m number of lymphocytes. 

6. Disappearance of toxic granulation. 

Therefore, the following are unfavorable 

hematologic signs: 

1. A moderate or slight rise in the total 
number of leukocytes associated with a 
marked shift to the left during the height of 
the disease. 

2. Failure of eosinophils to reappear in 
the end stages of an Infectious disease when 
they were absent before. 

3. Absolute reduction of lymphocytes. 

4. Excessive number of cells with toxic 
granulation. 

Specifically, in tuberculosis, in addition 
to the Increase of monocytes, the disappear- 
ance of young leukocytes is a prognoslically 
poor sign. Therefore, improvement is indi- 
cated by a drop of monocytes and reappear- 
ance of young leukocytes and increase in 
the number of lymphocytes. 


^Eosinophilia 

Definition. Eosinophilia is an increase of 
eosinophilic granulocytes above the highest 
normal of 500 per cu. mm. counted just bke 
white blood cells ivith a special diluent. 

The close association of eosinophilic 
leukocytes with “Allergy, broadly conceived, 
is impressive. One could easily correlate 
practically all eosinophilias ivith one form 
of allergy or another. An individual host 
factor has to be assumed to explain varia- 
tions in eosinophil response. The eosinophils 
in the blood come from the marroiv; those 
in the tissues come from the blood. 


Laboratory AfETiioDS 

Conditions Characterized by 
Eosinophilia 

i. Allergic diseases: bronchial asthma, 
hay fever, angioneurotic edema, urticaria’ 
erythema multiforme. Eosinophils are found 
in the peripheral blood, marrow, sputum (in 
bronchial asthma), nasal and conjunctiial 
discharges (in hay fever), and urticarial 
skin lesions and vesicles. Blood eosinophilia 
is usually only mild or moderate. 

The exact role of eosinophils in the al- 
lergic immunologic reaction has not been 
determined. 'Histamine, which is the sub- 
stance involved in such reactions, is sup- 
posed to'attracfebsinophils chemotactically. 

• S'. Skin disorders of various kinds. In 
some of them the allergic background Is 
apparent, for e.xample, ■'allergic eczema and 
dermatitis venenata; in others it may be 
surmised. There is frequently a clear-cut 
diiect relation between the degree of eosino- 
philia and extent of cutaneous invohemcot. 

.3. Parasitic infestations. Eosinophilia is 
more pronounced if tissues are invaded (for 
example, trichinosis) than when parasites 
are inhabiting the lumen of a viscus (for 
example, tapeworm). The role of free ex- 
change of tissue fluids (metabolic continu- 
ity) Is evident by disappearance of eosin- 
ophilia in some forms of infestation when 
encysrment occurs (for example, cysticer- 
cosis). 

In trichinosis eosinophOs begin to rise 
in the blood within days after infection 
The peak of the eosinophilia, from 40 to 60 
per cent, is during the third or fourth weeks 
(Gould. 1945). 

Leukocytosis and eosinophilia extending 
over months are seen in visceral larva 
migrans (dog and cat roundworm) infwta- 
lion. In this condition pulmonary lesions 
(Loeffler’s syndrome) may be present. In 
Loefller’s eosinophilic pneumonitis, the 
fleeting pulmonary infiltrates are thought to 
be caused by passage of the parasites from 
the blood into the alveoli of the lung. (Re* 
garding local tissue eosinophilia in Loeb 
fier’s syndrome, see item 11 in this sectioa) 

Another parasitic infestation with cosin- 
ophilia is creeping eruption caused by larvae 
of the dog or cat hookw’orm. 

Eosinophilia may be absent in severe 
infestations with trichinae. The prognosis 
in such cases seems aggravated. 

'Al. Eosinophiha of various degrees Is seen 
in many infectious diseases. Some of them 
(for example, scarlet fever) have cutaneous 
rashes, probably of allergic nature, some

large number of eosinophils In the mucous

cosinophilia and lymphocytosis Ncutro

may last for several months On the other 
hand injection of splenic extracts in ani 
mals has been reported to produce cosmo

openla 

8 Tile constitutional element in cosino 
philia is exemplified in familial cosinophilia 
In some reported casts infestation with 
parasites and subclinlcal allergy have not 
been excluded 

0 There is no satisfactory explanation for 
occasional instances of moderate and even 
severe cosinophilia general or local in 
patients with various neoplasms and a van 
ety of other conditions (for example ovar 
ian cysts Eosinophilia is seen more fre 


qucntly in neoplasms involving serous sur 
faces and bone and in those with excessive 
necrosis 

10 Various drugs have been reported to 
be responsible for cosinophilia pilocarpine 
physostlgmine digitalis phosphorus ben

Eosmol riiio 

Dcriniiioii EosJnopema is a decrease be 
low the lowest normal of 50 per cu mm It 
is seen most frequently in the presence of 
infectious neutrophilia In severe infections 
In Cushings synd rome the count ranges 
from oTo ao per cu mm It results from 
hyiieracUvity of the adrenal cortex After 
major surgical operations there Is a drop 
within four to six hours In the presence 
of adequate adrenal function In postopera 
tlvc shock not associated with massiv'e hem 
orrbage a normal or high eosinophil count 
indicates adrenal Insufficiency 

Eosinopcnia Is seen after electric shock 
therapy in eclampsia and in labor 
The eosinopcnia following parenteral ad 
ministration of certain adrenal cortical hor 
mones and of substances ('AC^TII and epi 
nephnne) that increase the output of these 
hormones is the basis for a test for adrenal 
function 

Tliom ct al <J948) recommended a test 
for evaluation of adrenal cortical function 
based on the development of eosinopenia 
following the injection of ACTH (adreno 
coriicolropic hormone) Absence of a slg 
nificant drop of eosinophils is interpreted 
as evidence of adrenal cortical insufficiency 
At the present time the value of the test 
IS limited (Huntsman et nl 1959) 
Technique of Absolute Eovmonbil Count 
Regular or special (Fuchs Rosenthal) count 
ing chamber and a special staining fluid ate 
used (Randolph 1944) The technique of 
counting white blood cells described on p 
103 applies to counting of eosinophils 



Clinical Diagnosis 

'Basophilia 

Definition Basophilia is an increase of 
basophilic granulocytes in the peripheral 
blood be>ond the normal range of l''per 
cent 

Basophilia is seen most frequently m 
'chronic granulocytic leukemia myelcad 
metaplasia (extramedullary mjelopoiesis) 
and polycythemia Relative basophiha may 
be transient following irradiation Baso 
philia may be present in chrome hemolytic 
anemia and following splenectomy In some 
infections basophils disappear at the same 
time as eosinophils and then both reappear 
when recovery sets m Tissue basophils 
mast cells are entirely different from baso 
philic granulocytes 


Basopenia 

In view of the ranty of these cells in 
normal persons a decrease cannot be read 
ily detected and interpreted except m acute 
infections when basophils disappear at first 
together with the eosinophils and reappear 
later ivith the lowering of the neutrophiba 

Lymphocytom 

Definition LjTnphocytosis is an increase 
m the number of IjTnphocytes in the pe 
npheral blood abote the normal range of 
1000 to 4000 per cu mm in the adult and 
1500 to 8500 in the child 
Relative lymphocytosis is present in van 
ous conditions in which there is a'^neutro 
penia True lymphocytosis is present in 
various infections but mainly late in the 
disease and dunng recovery It is common 
in exanthems (for example 'tJeiman 
measles) and also has been reported in 
brucellosis and secondary and congenital 
syphihs It IS considered a good omen in 
tuberculosis In thyrotoxicosis lympbocy 
tosis IS present frequently In some of these 
patients there is also splenomegaly (Means 
1948) In-^eitussis lymphocytosis may be 
high early m the catarrhal stage and persist 
all through the entire course and late in 
convalescence 

Infectious Lymphocytosis 
This infectious and contagious disease of 
unknown etiology described by C H Smith 
(1941) involves a high lymphocyte count 
and occurs mamly in children The incuba 
uon period is 12 to 21 days The disease 
sometimes occurs without systemic mam 


Laboratorv Mfthods 

Testations and somctiwes with vomiune 
fever abdominal discomfort signs suggest 
mg involvement of the nervous system 
cutaneous rashes upper respiratory infec 
tions and diarrhea Usually the high white 
count (20 000 to 40 000 and higher) pre 
cedes the chmeal manifestations From 60 
to 95 per cent of the cells in the differential 
count are mature adult small lymphocytes 
not like those seen m infecuous mononucle- 
osis There is vsuaU) an increase of the 
eosmophils The lymphocytosis lasts three 
to five weeks and longer There are no 
other blood changes The marrow is not 
characteristic Increase of lymphocytes has 
been observed but is probably due to ad 
mixture of penpheral blood Lymph node 
enlargement is rare and minimal when 
present The spleen and liver are rarely if 
ever enlarged Lymph node biopsy may 
show reactise follicular hyperplasia but no 
characteristic changes 

The presumptive and differenual tests for 
infectious mononucleosis are both negatne 
(For details regarding tests for infectious 
mononucleosis see p 217ff ) In some cases 
there has been an increase of white cells 
in the cerebrospinal fluid with about 40 
per cent lymphocytes The disease is dis 
tinctly infectious and contagious The 
course is benign 

There is another form of infectious 
lymphocytosis chronic in its course with 
a leukocytosis of 10 000 to 25 000 with 
60 to 80 per cent lymphocytes of normal 
appearance and a sbght increase of 
eosmophils monocytes and plasma cells 
As a r^e the children have enlarged tonsils 
lymph nodes and spleen and a history of 
recurrent upper respiratory infections The 
marrow shows no abnonriahues 

Infectiotis Monoitttcleosts 

Definition Infectious mononucleosis Is an 
acute self hmited infectious disease of the 
reticuloendothehal tissues especially of the 
lymphatic ussues with characteristic cluu 
cal hematolo^c pathologic and specific 
serologic changes 

The mam reason for clinical interest m 
infectious mononucleosis is that it imitates 
many diseases some of them serious some 
inviting surgical intervenuon and 
with senous prognostic implications Tee 
bnef sketch of the chnical^anifestations 

of the disease and the three tables that fw 
low illustrate the difficulties of differential 
diagnosis (Davidsohn and Lee 1962) 


The 

Onsti The onset is \apuc indefinite and 
similar to the onset of other infectious 
diseases This stage lasts about four to fi\e 
da)s 

Duration The disease proper lasts as a 
rule from 7 lo 21 

Clinical Picture Fc\er vanes from mild 
to moderate occasionally up to 106° F 
Chills sweats ftcadiche dizziness malaise 
pharyngitis tonsillitis retro-orbital aching 
irriiabilltv prostration and asthenia may be 
seen ill of varying severity 

L)mi>h Isodcs Enlargement maj vary 
from slight to marked but is usually not too 
excessive averaging about the size of a 
plum The enlargement ma> be stmul 
tancous wiih the onset of Sc\cr or may fo) 
low or even precede It It develops rapidly 
sometimes In a matter of hours There is no 
pcnlymphadcnUls As a rule there is tender 
ness but It Is transient It is Important to 
look for it because it differentiates this type 
of lymph node cnlargcmom from that seen 
in leukemia 

As a rule cervical lymph nodes arc the 
first to be enlarged first on one side and 
then on the other and then other regions 
arc affected including mediastinal and in 
guina! The enlargement is transient but 
occasionally has a tendency to persist for 
a long time 

Spleen There Is frequent splenomegaly 
of varying degrees Occasionally the spleen 
may lie enlarged ttirhoiu nouccable iymph 
node enlargement It is frequently tender 
and the enlargement sometimes persists for 
a long time 

Lner The liver is less frequently cn 
larged than the spleen and occasionally 
fender 

The various comphcaihns the anatomic 
lesions underlying tJiem and the re 
semblance to various diseases arc all shown 
in Tables 4-n 4-12 and 4-13 

Relapses are not uncommon Occasionally 
there may be several and some may be 
more severe than the original attack 

Rccuircnctv arc rare but they do occur 
sometimes after intervals of months or even 
years 

Death occurs as a rule only from compb 
cations for example ruptured spleen m 
voUement of the central nervous system 
cerebral hemorrhage and complicating sep 
tic infection

is probably slight Epidemics do occur and 
many have been described sometimes of 
very large proportions in schools and homes 
for Children 

Age The disease has been observed in 
patients from 3 months to 70 years but the 
disease occurs rarely above college age Most 
epidemics have been in adolescents and 
children 

Sex. Males are affected more frequently 
than females (ratio 2 to 2) 

The greater frequency of the diagnosis of 
the disease among nurses and college and 
medical students is probably explained by 
better medical supervision The disease has

v^ccording to Wrobleivski, when infecDous 
mononucleosis is complicated by bepatms, 
there is a nse in semin glutamic oxalic 
transaminase (SCOT) and serum glutamic 
pyru\ic transaminase (SGPT) at a time 
when b\er function tests may be normal or 
inconclusively affected as measured by con 
^enaonal tests (Wroblewski, 1958) 

Infections Those due to pyogenic bac 
teria (Smusilis, oOtis bronchopneumonia) 
can be readily controlled, but staphylococ 
cus infection may be serious or esen fatal 
Virus infection may be difficult to control 
A fatality due to measles coropUcaiing in 
fecuous mononucleosis has been reported 
(Kouba et al , 1961) 

Other Complications These include aascK 
pharyngeal hemorrhage jaundice hemolytic 
anemia, hematuna. myositis or myalgia 
hemoptysis and uterine bleeding Con 
genital tnalformauon of heart has been re 


potted following infectious mononucleosis 
of mother during first trimester 

Late Complications Chrome lesions of 
the li\er ha\e been reported (Kouba and 
Alasek, 1 960) 

Blood Findings 

There are no changes in the red blood 
cells and in platelets except in rare cases of 
compbeating hemolytic anemia and throm 
bocytopenia There is an increase of white 
blood cells ranging from 12 000 to 25 000 
and sometimes higher The highest counts 
in adults that lia^e been obserted were 
40 000 but counts as high as 70 000 have 
been seen in children The leukocytosis 
is usually brief The total white count is, as 
a rule, within normal brmts within a week 
or two 

The increase is due to a nse in lympho 
cytes These cells show characteristic 
changes, which can be summed up as 
foUons 

1 Hyperplasia or an increase in their 
number 



Clinical Diagnosis b\ 

2 Hypertrophy or an inczease in mye of 
the indi\idual cells 

3 Nuclear changes are characterized by 
an increased density of the chromaUn and 
by changes in shape (Plate 4-14) They 
show deep indentations and many ai« 
lobated resembling m general outlines 
nuclei of monocytes The cytoplasm shows 
basophiha a decrease of azurophilic 
granules and frequently marked vacuolar 
degeneration Some cells resemble plasma 
cells some have nucleob Some cells re 
semble monocytes (monocytoid deviauon) 
Occasionally cells show anaplasia and re 
semble prolymphocytes It Is m these cases 
that one has to consider lymphocytic leu 
kemia in the differential diagnosis 

The polymorphism of the lymphocytes is 
the striking feature of the differential blood 
picture (see Plate 4-14) 

Not infrequently there are rapid and as 
a rule transient rises m the number of 
monocytes The term mononucleosis refers 
to an increase of lymphocytes and not of 
monocytes From 60 to 90 per cent of the 
cells m the differential white count are 
lymphocytes Usually the mononucleosis re 
mains for weeks but may persist for months 
and longer 

The neutrophils are relatively decreased 
in proportion to the rise of the lymphocytes 
Early in the disease there may be a transient 
shift to the left ivith an mcrease of band 
cells and metamyelocytes The eosinophils 
are within normal limits 
The cytologic changes are by no means 
pathognomomc of infectious mononucleosis 
Similar cells in similar numbers may be 
found in other diseases especially in upper 
respiratory infections m children in b\er 
diseases and espeaally in viral mfections

Pathology 

In addition to the previously menOoned 
gross changes in lymph nodes spleen and 
liver recent studies have shoivn extensile 
microscopic changes not only m lymph 
nodes but also m the spleen hver and other 
tissues In the lymph nodes there is a com 
plete transformation of the architecture 
with crowding of the parenchyma by pro- 
liferation of large cells resembUng reticu 
lum cells Some of them have a striking 
resemblance to the so-called abnormal 
lymphocytes seen m the penpheral circula 
uon 

In the spleen which is large and ex 
tremely soft similar changes are present 
The follicles are small and compressed by 
the proliferating cells The capsule and 
trab^ulae are thinned out and eaten away 
by the proliferation This explains the ease 
with which the spleen ruptures on sbght 
trauma or mcrease of intra abdominal pres- 
sure In many places there are subintimal 
infiltrations m the trabecular veins and 
one can see masses of cells pounng out from 
the infiltration into the lumen of the blood 
vessels 

In the hver massive infiltration is present 
in the penportal spaces consisting of large 
cells resembhng those seen in the spleen 
lymph nodes and the penpheral blood 
Sometimes there is also infiltration ivithin 
the sinusoids 

In cases with pulmonary lesions that are 
seen sometimes there are massive pen 
bronchial infiltrations which explam some 
of the changes seen in the x ray Such 
findmgs may suggest the diagnosis of virus 
pneumoma (Arendt 1950) Occasionaliv 
large masses of infiltrating mononuclear 
cells are seen within the alveoh in pneu 
moniahke fashion , 

Infiltrations have also been seen in tn® 
kidneys in vanous parts of the central 
nervous system and in peripheral 
The lesions m the liver explain the at>-

but not claimed Reinauer intcqirets the

moves antisheep agglutinins in the serum of 
patients with serum disease and various 
other infections but not in the serum of

clinical or blood changes suggestive of in 
fectious mononucleosis The diagnosis of 
HodgUns disease avas made on a lymph 
node and confirmed by autopsy (Pessin) 
Other cases of Hodgkins disease and of 
serologically established infectious mono 
nucleosis present simultaneously have been 
reported previously (Massey et al 1953) 
\Vith these two exceptions among the 
many hundreds of cases studied the dif 


fcrentiol test was positive only in infectious 
mononucleosis and was negative in all other 
diseases The differential test is a specific 
and qualitative test The height of the tuer 
is not important 

On the basis of GOO carefully studied 
cases Bender (1958) concluded that there 
IS no satisfactory evidence that a positive 
diffcrenttal test for infectious mononu 
cleosis can be dupbeated by any other 
condition 

As a rule the test is positive when 
the patient presents symptoms of the dis 
case or when he is first examined The test 
may be negative early in the disease and 
■ may remain negative as long as three weeks 
Therefore if the first test is negative and 
if cLnieal and hematologic findings stiU 
suggest the disease until at least the third 
week from onset it is necessary to repeat 
the test The test remains positive for weeks 
and sometimes months after the clinical 
symptoms have disappeared 

In some of the other reported cases of 
alleged infectious mononucleosis the pre 
sumptive test alone was used and not the 
complete differennal test in others the 
recommended technique was not followed 
c g centrifugation was used to accelerate 
the incubation period or the tests were 
kept in the refrigerator overnight The latter 
modification brings into play cold ag 
gluumns which may increase the uter con 
siderabiy. but not specifically, with resulung 
false positive readings 

Details regarding the differential test are 
summanzed in Tables 4~17 4-18 4-19

Table 4-19 The Differential Test 
Interpretation of Results 


In serum of patients with infectious monooucleosis, absorption with Fonsman antigen will result in a partia 
removal of the agglutinin fof sheep red cells, but, as a rule not less than one fourth of the original titer will stil 
be present in the serum after absorption For example an ongmal titer of 1 112 may be reduced to 1 28 after 
absorption with Forssman antigen 

If aU or almost all (moie than 90 per cent) of the sheep agglutinins ha\e been remosed by absorptiori with 
Forssman antigen this speaks against infectious mononucleosis 
On the other hand, so far no other condition has been found, except infectious mononucleosis, in which Foessman 
antigen fads to remote sheep agglutinins from the serum 
The absorption with beef red cells is a confirenatory procedure in infectious mononucleosis since absorption 
with beef cells remotes all or almost all (more than 90 per cent) of the sheep agglutinins from the serum. Failure 
of beef cells to remove sheep agglutinins speaks against infectious mononucleosis 
It may be preferable to ^ the absorption wuh Forssman antigen and with beef cell antigen in EVERY case 
The absorption with beef cells is essential in pauents with elevated titers of antuheep agglutinins if no clinical or 
hematologic findings are present suggestive of infectious mononucleosu In most of these instances the antisheep 
agglutinins will be completely removed by Forssman anugen, but, in rare instances, the absorpuon may be m 
complete The use of the beef cell antigen wiU then be decisive

of hemolysis than tube 11 — the 50 per

posiave Control tubes 8 9 and 10 should 
show no hemolysis 

Interpretation A titer of 480 or higher 


IS considered to be presumptite evidence 
for the ^agnosis of infectious mononu 
cleosis False positive tests have been en 
countered in patients without clinical or 
hematologic evidence of infectious mono- 
nucleosis The specificity of the test is com 
parable with that of the presumptive test 
for mfcctious mononucleosis (Davidsohn 
1938 Davidsohn and Stem 1951) 

Woilners Entyme Test for Infectious 
Rfononucleosis ISo Principle Dilutions 
of serum are set up with normal sheep cells 
and with sheep cells previously treated with 
papain (WoUner 1955) 

Procedure 

1 Preparation of stock solution of 
papain Grind 1 gm of papain into lOO 
ml of 0 85 per cent sodium chloride solu 
tion in a mortar separate and discard the 
undissolved sediment Divide the super 
natant solution m aliquots of 0 5 ml and 
keep frozen 

2 Preparation of the dilute papam solu 
tion To 0 5 ml of stock solution of papam 
add 4 5 ml of buffered saline which is pre 
pared fay adding one volume of 0 25 M pH 
7 3 Sorenson phosphate buffer to nine 
volumes of 0 85 per cent sodium chloride 
soltmon 

3 Add one \olume of packed sheep cells

6 Make a 2 per cent suspension of 
washed but untreated sheep cells 

7 Inactivate serum at 56® C for 30 min

senal twofold dilutions with 0 85 per cent 
sodium chloride in a volume of 0 25 ml 
and with dilutions of 1/5 1 10 1 20 and 
so on up to 1 2560 (For details see pro-

/iifer/iremtjon of results In serum of 
patients with mfectious mononucleosis the 
titer of agglutinins is higher vvith normal 
slieep cells whereas in normal serum and in 
conditions other than infectious monouu 
cleosis the titer is higher with papom 
treated red cells The value of this test is 
liimted because about 30 per cent of serums 
of patients with infectious mononucleosis 
do not react as described 

^Vollner’s Eniyme Test for Infectious 
Mononucleosis 2* Pnnciple The serum 
IS absorbed with papain treated sheep red

Interpretation In infectious mononu 
cleosis the agglutinin uter of the absorbed 
serum titrated with untreated cells is al 
ways four or more tubes higher than the 
one titrated with papam treated cells In 
conditions other than Infectious mono 
nucleosis papain treated cells absorb the 
sheep agglutinin completely or give a higher 
uter than the untreated cells This is a 
high!) specific test Data from our labora 
tory confirm Wollner s observation 

Etiology 

The etiology of the disease is not known 
although it IS suspected to be caused by a 
virus Successful transmissions of the dis 
ease from monkey to man from man to 
monkey and from man to man have been 
reported but require confirmation 

Misao and Kobayashi (1955 1960) inocu 
lated mice with marrow and Ijmph node 
tissue of patients with infectious mono- 
nucleosis From the mice they isolated a 
microorganism and called it Ricfecftsm sen 
netSMi Volunteers inoculated with matenal 
obtained from the mice developed infectious 
mononucleosis and a positive differential 
test However according to Eyquem (1961) 
the serologic tests were not of the kind seen 
in human infectious mononucleosis m 
Europe 

EPIDE^^OLOGY 

The peaks of morbidity in a military 
academy occurred in February and August 
exactly on the forty fifth day foUoiving 
vacations Hoagland (1955) postulates 
transmission by passionate kissmg for 
which the vacauon penod offers greater op- 
pottumties The incubation m 71 of 73 
patients was 42 to 49 days following inti 
mate oral contact in one senes In 68 per 



The Blood 22*? 


cent of another senes the oncubatjon was 
31 to 60 days Other epidemiologic obser 
\otions indicate that hissing is by no means 
the only means of transmission 

There is reason to believe that there are 
carriers of the disease who are free of 
clinical manifestations 

The possible role of "Mono -Annies in 
the epidemiology of the disease has been 
suggested drawing the analogy from Ty 
phoid Marys (Godden 1960)

^lotiocytosts 

Monoc>tosis is an increase of monocytes 
aboie the normal o£ 500 per cu mm The 
normal range in the penphcra! blood is 
1 to 6 per cent 

Monocytosis is present during the reco\ 
ery stage from acute infections and is 
usually considered a fa\orabIe sign except 
in tuberculosis iSn increase of monocytes 
in tuberculosis is a”^oor prognostic sign An 
mdex has been developed expressing the 
ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes The ah 
solute number of lymphocytes is divided by 
the absolute number of monocytes and if 
the quoUent is higher than 1 the prog 
nosis is better than if it is lower 


Monocytosis may be present in subacute 
bacterial endocarditis In this condition 
monocytes may show phagocytosis of other 
blood cells red blood cells and leukocytes 
It may be present in’^odgkin s disease in 
mycotic rickettsial protozoal and viral in 
fections as well as m various lipoid storage 
diseases such as Gaucher s disease and 
Niemann Pick disease

Maugnant Lymphoma 

The terminology of lesions referred to in 
the heading of this section is still in a state 
of confusion For example some use the 
term lymphoma to indicate malignant 
lesions of lymphoid tissues Some include 
all neoplastic or borderline neoplastic or 
hyperplastic lesions of blood produemg us 
sues under this heading One popular 
medical dictionary defines lymphoma as 
"a benign tumor composed of lymiphatic 
tissue Another dicuonary defines It as 
“any tumor made up of lymphoid tissue " 
To avoid misunderstanding the term 
mabgnant lymphoma is used here A classi 
fication of malignant lymphoma is given 
m Table 4 22 

Transitions from one type of malignant 
lymphoma to another are known to occur 
Changes from aleukemic to leukemic forms 
are even more common except for Hodg 
kins granuloma The leukemic phases may 
be transient

Hodgkin s Disease 

Jackson and Parker (1947) who desised 
a classification for this disease recognized 
three forms paragranuloma granuloma 
and sarcoma The paragranuloma Is com 
parati\ely the least malignant m its course 
and the microscopic picture shows least 
variation from the normal but each of 
these forms contains the Sternberg Reed 
cells 

The paragranuloma shows no necrosis 
and the predominant cell is the adult 
lymphocyte Sternberg Reed cells are few 
Eosmophils are rare Plasma cells are quite 
common This form may pass into granu 
loma at any time 

Many authors doubt that paragranuloma 
is an entity as distinctly discernible as 
claimed by Jackson and Parker especially 
on histologic grounds On the other hand 
the great variation in the clinical course is 
undeniable 

Blood Picture Normocytic sometimes 
severe anemia is seen in about SO per cent 
of cases 

The leukocyte count may be elevated 
normal or reduced (leukopenic) The dif 
feiential count shoivs neutrophilia lympho- 
cytopenia monocytosis and eosmophilia 
Either all or any combination of these 
may be present 

Neutrophilic leukocytosis is seen espe 
cially when lymph nodes are involved and 
neutropenia when bone marrow is imohed 
The blood changes seem to depend on the 
stage of the disease and on some individual 
as yet unknown factors 

The most frequent finding is a moderate 
leukocytosis with white cell counts rang 
mg from 12 000 to 25 000 per cu mm and 
a relative and even absolute lymphopenia 
In the difTerentiil count the lymphocytes 
may decrease below 10 per cent A slight 
shift to the left may be present in the 
neutrophils The pathogenesis of this 
change is impairment of lymphocytogenic 
properues of reticuloendothehal tissues by 
the disease As a rule lymphopenia is prog 
nostically a poor omen 

Monocytosis is frequent with values of 
10 per Cent or higher Eosmophilia has been 
desenbed in about 20 per cent of cases and 
may be extreme The platelet count may be 
mcreased normal or decreased especially 
with marrow involvement 

Marrow Findings Frequently there is a 
shift to the left ol the granulocytes shght 
monocytosis and eosmophilia As a rule 


findings are not characteristic Amyloid de 
generation of various grades is sometimes 
present in various organs and with it plasma 
cell hyperplasia in the marrow Tlie marrow 
may be diagnostic when Hodgkins granu 
loma with its characteristic pattern mclud 
mg Sternberg Reed giant ceUs is seen in a 
biopsy and occasionally in marrow punc 
turc smears 

Lymphosarcoma (Lymphocytic) 
Lymphopema may be present similar to 
that seen in Hodgkm s disease but as a rule 
there is no leukocytosis except in the leu 
kemic variant 

Macboglobueinemia 
This vanant of malignant lymphoma 
(Waldenstroms disease lymphocytic plas 
mocync leukemia) is characterized by 
hyperglobuhnemia fibnnogenopenia ane 
mia and bleeding tendency from mucous 
membranes Microscopic sections of lymph 
nodes and marrow aspirates show cells re 
semblmg plasma cells and lymphocytes with 
large PAS posmve cytoplasmic granules 
The elevated serum gamma globulin has an 
extremely high molecular weight of 1 miUion 
with segmentation constant of 18 to 20 
Svedberg units These macroglobulins make 
up 3 to 5 per cent of the normal senrni 
proteins In macroglobulinemia they 
amount to 20 per cent or more The Sia 
test (water diluuon test) is strongly posi 
tive 

The Sia Test 

Procedure Into a test tube containing 
distilled water a drop of serum is permitted 
to fall from a pipet Normally the drop dis 
appears leav-mg a famt haziness In macro 
giobulinemia the precipitate is heav7 does 
not dissolve and drops to the bottom It can 
be further identified The test is negative 
when only small or moderate and occa 
sionally even large amounts of macro 
globulin are present It is not diagnostic by 
Itself It may be positive in rheumatoid 
arthritis The diagnosis of the disease can be 
irade defimtive only by ultracentrifuge 
analysis of the serum 

Leukemic Variants of Lymphomas 
Lymphomas may become leukemic In 
which case the neoplastic cells are invad 
ing the peripheral circulation This change 
is most common m chloroma It is next 
most frequent in lymphocytic sarcoma Fre 
quently the blood picture is that of typical

chronic or subacute lymphocytic leukemia 
In some cases the cliaracteristic neoplastic 
cells permit a diagnosis of lymphosarcoma

less frequent m follicular lymphoma and 
reticulum cell sarcoma and docs not occur 
m Hodgkins disease 

v^EUKEMU 

Definition Leukemia is an acute or chronic 
systemic disease of the white blood cell 
producing tissues characterized fay hyper 
piasia of leukocytes (granulocytes ijmpiio 
cytes or monocytes) and their precursors 
frequently but not invariably ivith cor 
responding quantitative and qualilame 
changes in the circulating white blood cells 
and infiltration of organs and tissues in a 
widespread and irregular manner similar to 
the behavior of malignant lymphomas 

There are at the present time three dif 
ferent conceptions regarding the nature of 
leukemia 

1 Leukemia is a neoplasm of the mar 
row or of the lymphatic or reticuloendothe 
hoi tissues as the case may be 

2 It 15 a hyperplastic condition of the 
corresponding tissues 

3 Leukemia Is closely related to but not 
identical with neoplastic diseases arising 
in hemopoietic tissues According to this 
opinion the malignant nature of leukemias 
has not been definitely established

Classification According to thc consensus 
of the members of the Committee for Clari 
ficaiion of the Nomenclature of Cells and 
Diseases of the Blood and Blood forming 
Organs the leukemias should be classified 
in the Standard Nomenclature of Disease 
under thc etiologic category of “new growth 
originating m specialized mescnchymatous 
tissue (Jordan 1942) (Table 4-24} Fa%or 
mg the inclusion of leukemias under malig 
nant tumors in the judgment of the Com 
miltee is the fact that the therapy cur 
rently used for these diseases (te leu 
kemias) is thc same as is used for un 
questioned mahgnant neoplasms ” 

The fourth report of the Nomenclature 
Committee defines leukemias at ncopjastic 
diseases arising In hemopoietic tissues in 
which the type cells appear In the blood or 
are disseminated diffusely through the mar 
row If the cell senes cannot fac identified 
then the leukemia should be included in thc 
category “type unclassified " Usually lint 
means an acute leukemia of unidentified

there is hemolytic anemia with a shortened

mon Not infrequently the anemia is caused 
or aggravated by hypersplenism This can 
be demonstrated by differences in surface 
counts over the spleen and liver following 
administration of labeled patient s own red 
cells If the spleen to-liv er ratio is 2 to 1 
splenectomy has been recommended 
Another cause of anemia m such patients 
was found to be accelerated p’asma iron 
half time clearance owing to a trapping

locjtic leukemia the lesion is monotonoush 
mjeloblastic Hence, the inference by some 
that at least this form of leukemia Is a neo- 
plasm Even that cannot be sustained, be- 
cause in some cases of agranulocytosis one 
finds in the marrow nothing but myelo- 
blasts, a reversible lesion, which as a rule 
returns to normal 

It IS on the basis of all these observations 
that some have concluded that leukemias 
are hyperplasnc systemic diseases 

The fact that leukemia is irreversible and 
as a rule fatal is used by some in support of 
Its neoplastic nature The answer to this is 
that prior to the discovery of liver therapy 
pernicious anemia had had the same at 
tributes The advocates of the hypothesis of 
neoplasia argue that in some cases of 
leukemia there are locahred tumor hke pro- 
liferations with a malignant type of growth 
and that there are true tumors of blo^ pro- 
ducing organs that show transitions to leu 
kemias However, these are isolated cases 
with features that set them apart from the 
usual case of leukemia They are not suffi 
ciently convinemg to be used as a basis for 
developing a hypothesis regarding (he na 
ture of all leukemias It is possible that 
leukemia may be associated with a true 
neoplasm There is a difference between 
recognizing leukemia as a neoplasm, the 
possibility that a neoplasm may develop on 
the basis of leukemia, and the development 
of leukemia from a lymphoma 

According to some authors leukem/a is a 
precancerous stage of a cancer of hematopo- 
ietic tissues The expenments in animals 
could then be explamed in such a way that 
in cases in which leukemia has already 
become transformed into cancer a trans 
plantation of cells at that stage of leukemia 
would produce cancer 

Nature of Acute Leukemia According to 
some authors acute leukemia is a form of 


Labgr At OR V M FT! tons 

leukemia, equivalent to other farms Ac 
cording to others it is not a true leukemia 
but a reactiv e process in response to certain 
stimuh (for example, sepuc infecuons) On 
the other hand, it js possible that the infec 
tions are the result and not the cause of 
acute leukemia Also, other stimuli arc con 
sidered as possible causes of acute leu 
kemia, such as benzol, xravs and vanous 
drugs (for example, sulfonamides) 

Much has been written about cases of 
cured acute leukemias As a rule such re 
ports must be viewed with great suspicion 
However, when cases of this kind have been 
observed by reliable hematologists Includ 
mg Naegcb the possibility of their occur 
rence cannot be denied Some try to get 
around it by speaking of a so-called “mye- 
loblasiic reaction " Some go even further 
and see in every acute granulocytic leu 
kemia a reactive disturbance of the bone 
marrow and claim that the term acute 
leukemia does not apply to them 

There are true cancers of blood producing 
organs that show hematologic findings iden 
tical with those seen in certain forms of 
leukemia chloroma myeloblastoma, lymph 
osarcoma 

INCIDENCE 

In 1939 to 1940, 5286 deaths were at* 
tnbuted to leukemia in the United Slates 
— 0 39 per cent of all deaths and 3 G 
per cent of deaths due to cancer The 
death rate from leukemia has increased 
steadily in the United States from 39 per 
million in 1940 to 65 per million in 1051 
for the total population However, when the 
United Slates total population Is divided 
into those under 55 and those 55 and over, 
the rale of leukemia deaths increased from 
27 per mllJjon in 1940 to 35 per million in 
1954 for those under 55 years of age while 
it increased from 109 to 208 per million 
for those 55 years or over, i c the increase 


Plate 4-19 Acuie granulocytic leukemia penpheral blood The large myeloblasts with the immature 
granular and rcUculaced chromatin and the somewhat Indistinct nucleoli are charaeterJsiic The cytoplasm

peroxidase stain in the nght half of the smear shows varying numbers of oxidase-positive granules in all 
the cells That all cells have the peroxidase positive granules whereas granules are seen in only a few of 
those stained with the regular stain indicates that the granules demonstrated by the two stains are not 
identical The Auer bodies in three of the cells On the left tide are characteristic for ibis type of leukemia

anemia The lymphoblasts with immature nuclei many of them iodenfed with a reticulated delicate 
chromatin structure, multiple nucleoli, and only a narrow rim of agranular pale blue cytoplasm are 
charaetenstlc Two degenerating cells two normobUiti and one cell in mitosis arc present 

This preparation Is from an adult, in whom an acute lymphocytic leukemia is extremely rare According 
to some authors the disease can be diagnosed In an adult only U if develops in a Mricm wiib a chronic 
Ij-mphocytic leukemia (Plate from Hcllmeyer. L., and Begemann H Allas der Klinlschen lUmatoIogle 
und Cytologie Springer, 1955 ) 







The 

in rate for the younger group is 30 per cent 
but for 55 and o\er the increase is 91 per 
cent Since worldwide fallout x radiation 
affects the total population and affects the 
young more than the old fallout cannot be 
responsible for the increase in leukemia 
deaths (Dacquisto 1959) 

The figures for 1958 are 3 4 deaths per 
100 000 population for those under 20 and 
271 per 100 000 for those 60 and o\er 
(United States National Office o* Vital Sta 
Ustics) 

Chrome granulocytic leukemia is the 
most frequent form Statistics on the rela 
ti\e mcidence of \anous types of leukemia 
vary greatly but Rosenthals statement 
comes pretty close to actuality He claims 
that the relative incidence of granulocytes 
lymphocytes and monocytes in the penph 
eral blood is about the same as the mci 
dence of the corresponding three types of 
leukemia 

Orciipntion The disease is more preva 
lent among physicians than among white 
males m the general population (17 tiroes 
as frequent) and particularly frequent 
among r adiolog ists and persons exposed to 
radiation Among radiologists it is 8 to 10 
times as frequent as in nonradiologlsts 
Chronic exposure to radiation is the prob* 
able explanation of the greater frequency 
among radiologists (Hensbaw and Hawkins 
1944) This is supported by animal experi 
ments ft seems to 6e also more frequent m 
restaurant workers and typographers (Gram 
and Nielsen 1932) 

Heredity About 35 cases of multiple 
occurrence have been described in mem 
bers of the same family It may be important 
that in some instances of multiple occur 
rence different members of the families 
had different forms of leukemia

Serologic Aspects Patients with cJiromc 
leukemia are poor antibody producers They 
have low titers of natural antibodies (anti 
sheep agglutinms isoagglutmins) (David 
sobn 1938) Also immune antibodies may 
be Io« for example agglutinins for S tij 
phosa (Widal test) have been low in leu 
kemic patients who contracted typhoid 
fever This suggests that the reticuloendo- 
thehat system of patients with chronic leu 
kemia is inadequate In acute leukemia the 
titers of isoantibodies have been normal or 
high normal 

Cxpcruncnial Production In man leu 
keima has been attnbuted to exposure to 
various chemicals (for example benzol py 
ndine aniline dyes) and to xrays In am 
mals especially white mice injections of 
benzol produce leukemia or leukemia like 
conditions in about 15 per cent Polycyclic 
hydrocarbons estrogens and irradiation also 
produce leukemia Even oral administration 
of inethylcholanthrene produced leukemia 
in rats (Shay et fli 1950) 

Leukemia occurs in several animal spe 
cies and can be transmitted from animal to 
animal The experimental conditions vary 
from species to species Carcinogens xrays 
and estrogens can induce leukemia In mice 
The incidence of spontaneous leukemia in 
mice IS decreased by thymectomy Also diet 
low m cystine reduces the incidence of 
leukemia induced by carcinogen Spontane 
ous leukemia in mice is delayed by under 
feeding Immunity to transplanted leukemia 
can be produced by inoculation of sublethal 
doses of cells injections of suspensions of 
normal ussue cells of certain genetic con 
stitution and administration of beat IJlIed 
leukemic cells leukemic cell extracts or 
normal deiibnnated blood

General The onset of (he disease is 
sudden and differs strikingly from the in 
sidious onset of chronic Jeukemia The 
disease resembles an acute infectious or 
even a septic condition Other changes m 
dude fever rapidly developing anemia and 
signs of granulocytic insufficiency with ul 
cerations of mucous membranes especially 
of the mouth and throat and purpura En 
largemcnt of lymph nodes spleen and liver 
is not very pronounced Rheumatoid pains 
sometimes resembling acute rheumatic 
fever are frequent Marked prostration and 
general malaise may be present The course 
IS rapidly progressive Acute leukemia may 
imitate a vanety of diseases Some author^ 
speak of fulminant leukemia when the 
course is extremely rapid and the patient 
dies In a few weeks 

Lymph node enlargement is conspicuous 
only in acute monocj uc Jeukemia especially 
cervical Moderate gcncralired lymph node 
enlargement is more frequent in acute 
lymphocytic leukemia In monocytic leu 
kemia cervical lymph nodes arc also tender 

The spleen is only slightly enlarged ex 
cept in acute lymphocytic leukemia when 
It may be moderately or even greatly en 
larged 

Lesions in the mouth ivjth swelling ul 
ceration and hemonhages in the gums arc 
especially frequent In monocytic Icokemia 
but may also occur in other forms Mucosal 
ulcerations may also be present in other 
parts of the gastrointestinal tract Also 
these lesions are more frequent in mono 
cytJc leukemia 

In addition to rheumatoid pains prcvi

The frequent hemorrhagic tendency Is cx 
plained by thrombocytopenia or vascular 
damage sometimes caused by endothelial 
injury and sometimes by perivascular infil 
tration 

The predominant cell is an immature 
bias cell most frequently a myeloblast in 
the adult and a lymphoblast in the child 
If differenuation is not possible the term 
of blast cell leukemia may be used 

\ciite Granulocytic Leukemia Cell type 
myeloblast 

Cell morphology TTie nucleus shows a 
fine leuculated structure of chromatin with 
out condensations Tlicre is no nuclear 
membrane There are several distinct nucle- 
oli The cytoplasm is homogeneous without 
granules or with occasional azurophilic 
granules More mature forms between the 
blast forms and mature granulocytes are 
absent or scarce This gap between the Im 
mature myeloblasts and the mature seg 
mented leukocytes is known as leukemic 
hiatus or gap and is characteristic of many 
cases of acute granulocytic leukemia 
The presence of more than an occasional 
myelocyte and metamyelocyte suggests an 
acute phase or relapse of a chronic leuke 
mia The same holds if a mycloblastic blood 
picture is present but thrombocytopenia and 
purpura are absent or if there is splcno

Cell morphology Granular or stippled 
chroma in somewhat coarser than in a 
myeloblast Usually only one or two some 
what indistinct nucleoli not so many and 
not so sharply outlined as in a myeloblast 
The chromatin tends to be condensed at 
the edges suggesting a nuclear rncml nne 
There is frequently a clear pcnniiclcar rone 
The cytoplasm is basophilic and homoctne 
ous without granules It Is importmi to look 
carcfullv for granules in cytoplasm If these 
are present tl e possibility is tint one is

Acute Monocjtic Leukemia Cell type 
monoblast 

Cell morphology The nucleus has a 
very delicate reticular chromatin in the 
form of a finely meshed netivork and is fre 
quently folded indented or coarsely and 
incompletely segmented Nucleoli are less 
frequent and less prominent than in lymph 
oblasts and still less than in myeloblasts 

The cytoplasm is basophilic with few or 
no granules The oullme of the cytoplasmic 
margin is irregular and pseudopodium hke 
Phagocytes contaming cellular and nuclear 
particles pigment granules and red cells 
are seen 

There is usually a good admixture of 
monocytes in various stages of maturation 
In the monocytes the cytoplasm is grayish 
blue of ground glass appearance wiUi m 
numerable purplish pink, granules which 
are difficult to separate from each other 

Two forms of the disease are recognized 
The first is th^ so-called Ntegeli type which 
is a monocytic form of myeloblastic leuke 
mla ivith numerous myeloblasts the num 
ber of monoblasts and monocytes vanes 
from day to day and frequently gives way 
to an increase of myeloblasts The second 
Is the so called Schilling type which is a 
true monocytic or histiomonocytic leukemia 
According to Downey in the Schillmg type 
the monocytes are denved from the reticulo 
endothelial system and in the Naegeli type 
from myeloblasts 

vtliiRONic Leukemia 

Clinical Findings The disease may be 
present for a long ume even with increased 
white blood count and enlarged spleen and 
lymph nodes before there are clinical mani 
festations of disease The earliest signs of 
disease come from one or more of the fol 
Imving changes pressure of enlarged 
spleen h\er or lymph nodes symptoms 
from increased metabolism loss of weight 
nervousness perspiration and detenoration 
of the nutritional state Fever and bleeding 
occur late In a patient without any signs 
or symptoms of disease leukocytosis should 
suggest the possibility of an early leukemia 

Lymph nodes are enlarged mainly m 
lymphocytic and less frequently in granu 
locytic leukemia In either case enlargement 
is only moderate and there are no adhc 
sions to each other or to skin There is no 
tenderness and no change In the skin 
overlying the lymph nodes 


In the spleen enlargement is most pro 
nounced in chrome granulocytic leukemia 
InfiTCts and pensplemtis may produce 
chnfcal symptoms 

Blood m Chronic Leukemia Mncroscopic 
appearance In advanced cases the blood is 
thick and sticky and even smears are 
difficult to prepare In the hematocrit tube 
there is a thick layer of the bully coat This 
is particularly true in chronic granulocytic 
leukemia in which there is also a thick layer 
of platelets 

Ited cells In early stages of chrome 
leukemia there may be no anemia but it 
appears sooner or later Its intensity vines 
As a rule it is normocytic with anisocy 
tosis poikilocytosis is rare Normoblasts 
polychromatophiha basophibc stippling 
and reticulocytosis may be present espe 
cially in granulocytic leukemia even with 
slight or moderate anemia but not in 
lymphocytic leukemia 

Plniclets Early in the disease the plate 
let count 15 normal or skghtly increased 
Later it may be markedly increased In 
crease from subnormal to normal or a fall 
from excessively high to normal is indica 
tive of chnical improvement A persistentl> 
low count IS a poor prognostic sign 

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia the 
platelet count is usually not increased and 
IS sometimes low if it is considerably re 
duced the prognosis is poor 

fVh$te cells (Plates 4-15 4 18) In 
chronic granulocytic leukemia the white cell 
count IS greatly increased ranging from 
50 000 to 300 000 and even higher Myelo- 
blasts are usually few myelocytes and 
metamyelocytes are numerous Myelocytes 
may be increased to 50 per cent The blood 
smear may be as cellular as i smear of a 
normal sternal marrow 

There is an increase of eosinophils md 
basophils the latter 3 to 20 per cent The 
number of basophils is usually liigher than 
in any other disease 

A leukocytosis with fewer immature 
white cells offers a better prognosis thin 
when the outpouring of undifferentiated 
cells is more pronounced The presence 
of large numbers of undifferenuatcd white 
cells early m the disease is a particularly 
ominous prognostic indicator 

In chronic lymphocytic leukemii the 
white count is lower than in gnmilocytic 
and ranges from 30 000 to 100 000 The 
differential blood picture Js monotonous It 
shows mainly small lymphocytes with very 
httle cytoplasm The number of cells with 



240 Clisjcal Diagnosis bv 

azurophilic granules and the number of 
azurophilic granules in the individual cells 
are reduced. The nuclear chromatin is less 
dense than in normal lymphocytes. The 
cells vary only moderately in size. The 
nuclei, especially of the large IjTnphocytes, 
frequently show indentation. 

Anemia in Leukemia. Causes: replace- 
ment of erythropoietic tissue in the marrow 
and excessive hemolysis of red cells. Hemo- 
siderosis is the anatomic evidence of the 
hemolytic process. 

Anemia is frequently more severe in 
l>-mphoc}'tic leukemia than in granulocytic, 
probably due to marrow replacement. He- 
molytic anemia with autoantibodies Is com- 
mon in chronic lymphocytic but extremely 
rare in chronic granulocytic leukemia. Hy- 
poplastic anemia (myelophthisis) may de- 
velop occasionally. 

Increased basal meiaboUc rate Is frequent 
in chronic granulocitic and lymphocytic 
leukemias and in acute leukemia, usually 
directly proportional to the severity of the 
disease Possible cause: increased protein 
catabolism. After irradiation it rises'for a 
few days and then returns to normal for 
varying periods of time. Clinically, there 
is a striking dilTcrence from the changes 
seen in exophthalmic goiter, although there 
is some nervousness, tremor, and irritabil- 
ity. For example, there Is frequently no loss 
of weight as in hyperthyroidism. 
MrcRoscowc Tissue Changes in Ciinosic 
Leukemia 

Granuloc)ilc Leukemia. Infiltrations of 
granulocytic cells occur in various organs 
hut are usually earliest and most pro- 
nounced in spleen, liver, and l>'mph nodes 
Tliey may be present in any and all tissues 
The infiltrating granulocytic cells arc of all 
grades of matuniy In the liver the infiltra- 
tions arc, as a rule, more pronounced with- 
in the sinusoids in contrast to l)'mphocyUc 
leukemia where they arc located predom- 
inantly In periportal areas. 

There are three schools of thought re- 
garding the origin of the extramedullary 
myelopoietic foci In leukemia: 

1. They an? produced by metaplasia of 
multipotcntial mesenchyme in order to com- 
pensate for the marrow replaced or damaged 
by the leukemic process (compensation for 
marrow funcUon) or in response to the 
specific leukemic stimulus (enhancement 
of marrow function) 

2 They are implants of the leukemic 
blood cells (colonization). 


Labor.\torv Methods 

3. They arc metasiascs from leukemic 
marrow. 

In some Instances the cxtrarncdulhry 
foci are not limited to granulopoiesis but 
contain all three elements of marrow In 
varying proportions and are then referred 
to as foci of hematopoiesis. 

Extramedullary hematopoiesis is not lim- 
ited to leukemia. It occurs in any condition 
in which marrow is encroached upon by: 
invasion of nonmarrow tissue (for example, 
metastatic carcinoma); e.xcessive growth of 
tissue normally present in the marrow (for 
example, hyperplasia of ctythroid elements 
in pernicious or hemolytic anemia); or hy- 
perplasia of connective or osseous tissues, 
myelofibrosis or myelosclerosis. Myeloid 
metaplasia in the spleen may assume tre- 
mendous proportions (so-c^ed myeloid 
metaplasia syndrome). 

Bohr (1949) claimed that extramedul- 
lary granulopoiesis is the source of myelo- 
blasts and myelocytes in the peripheral 
blood. This alone is apparently not sufficient 
as evidenced by aleukemic leukemias with 
splenomegab'cs. Apparently a reJease mech- 
anism must be added to extramedullary 
myelopoiesis. 

Lymphocytic Leukemia. The accumula- 
tions in various organs and tissues consist 
of lymphocytes. They are thought to lie due 
to metaplasia of the mesenchyme. This ex- 
planation holds also for lymphocytic infil- 
trations in the marrow. 

Marrow rindings (Plates 4-16, 4-17, 
4-20). 

rinitr intkemia. Diffuse and progres- 
sive replacement of marrow and fat by un- 
differentiated cells lakes place witli thinning 
of trabeculae and cortex. New ebemotbera- 
pcuiic agents (for example, Amlnoptcrin)

increase of megakaryocytes, usually ^vith 
an accompanying thrombocythemia. Eosin- 
ophilic and basophilic granulocytes are fre- 
quently more numerous. 

Acute granulocytic leukemia. Many 
myeloblasts and undifferentiated red cells 

EosinobJiilic leukemia. Hyperplasia 
of eosinophilic granulocytes. Basophilic 
granulocytes may also be more numerous 
If the peripheral blood shows an increase. 

Chronic lymfihocytic leukemia. Fre- 
quently no changes. In advanced cases 
there is replacement by lymphocytes. An 
increase of lymphocytes over 50 per cent 
is indicative of Ij-mphocytic leukemia. 

Sources of Error. (1) Admixture of 
peripheral blood may be responsible for mis- 
leading results. (2) Lymph follicles, which 
are present in about 10 per cent of older 
persons. Marrow biopsy may be more help- 
ful. 

Monocytic leukemia. Large numbers of 
monoblasts, promonocytes, and monocytes. 
Sections of marrow biopsies resemble a 
reticulum cell sarcoma. 

Special Forms of Leukemia 

Histioc}t(c Leukemia (Histiocytic-mono- 
cytic Leukemia, Leukemic Reticuloendo- 
thellosis). The predominant cell is the xm- 
dliferentiated mesenchymal cell xvlth a blu- 
ish, homogeneous, agranular cytoplasm and 
a round or indented nucleus. The cytoplas- 
mic border is smooth and not indented by 
the adjacent red cells Clinical hndings: 
splenomegaly, normocytic anemia (which 
may be hemolytic), tliombocytopenia and 
purpura and frequently leukopenia. The 
maeroif shews large nambers af rev/oco’am 
cells. The lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and 
other viscera are similarly infiltrated. The 
disease is usually chronic. 

Stem Cell Leukemia. This is a variety of 
acute leukemia in wlUch the predominant 
cells are primitive undifferentiated leuko- 
cytes, wliich cannot be classified as one of 
tbe three blast forms. The cells are small 
and round, and the nuclei are round with 
a delicate chromatin structure, one or more 
nucleoli, and a narrow zone of basophilic 
agranular cytoplasm. There is a superficial 
resemblance to small lymphocytes. The 
course is, as a rule, that of acute or even 
fulminant leukemia. 

Plasmocytic Leukemia. Almost always a 
part of multiple myeloma xvith correspond- 
ing marrow findings. Infiltration of various 
tissues tvith plasmocytes. 


Thrombocyiic (Mcgakarjocytic) Leuke- 
mia (Essential Thrombocythemia). Ex- 
tremely rare and a doubtful entity. Most 
reported cases have probably been chronic 
granulocytic leukemia tvith excessive pro- 
liferation of megakaryocytes. The marrow 
shows hyperplasia of megakaryocytes of 
various grades of maturation without ac- 
companying granulocytic hyperplasia. Some 
cases of the disease have been seen with 
extremely large numbers of platelets. At 
autopsy there is widespread and diffuse 
infiltration with megakaryocytes and imma- 
ture granulocytes 

Chloroma. An acute myeloblastic leu- 
kemia with formation of tumors originating 
from periosteum, especially of skull, orbits, 
nasal sinuses, nbs, and v'ertebrae. These 
locations cause exophthalmus %vith disturb- 
ances of vision. Chloroma is a true cancer 
having destructive tendencies and forming 
hematogenous metastases. The sectioned 
surface of the tumor shows a green color 
owing to protoporphyrin. It fades on ex- 
posure and can be restored ivith hydrogen 
peroxide and preserx’cd by glycerin. There 
are aleukemic and leukemic forms, tbe lat- 
ter with chloroma cells in the blood. Clin- 
ically, the latter cases are Identical with 
acute granulocytic leukemia. 

Myeloblastoma. This condition differs 
from chloroma only by absence of pigment 

Eosinophilic Leukemia. Occurs but is ex- 
tremely rare. Acute and chronic forms have 
been described with tissue changes similar 
in every way to those in other forms of 
leukemia, except that most of the cells in 
tbe tissues as well as in the circulating 
blood have been adult differentiated forms 
of eosinophilic granulocytes. It is dl^t^t 
or impossible to differentiate this lesion 
from reactit'c hyperplastic changes, espe- 
cially early in the disease Leukocytosis and 
eosinophilia, no matter how high, are not 
sufficient to establish the diagnosis of 
leukemia; both can be seen in parasitic 
infestation. But the diagnosis can be made 
when there are in addition the other com- 
ponents that add up to the total picture of 
leukemia. This includes enlargement of 
spleen and lymph nodes, progressive ane- 
mia, thrombocytopenia, and normoblastemia. 

Basophilic Leukemia. Still less frequent 
than eosinophilic, but both chronic and 
acute cases have been described. It should 
be kept in mind that mast cells that resem- 
ble basophilic granulocytes are present in 
large numbers in the skin and marrow in 
urticaria pigmentosa.

as a local lesion and later shows aggressive

scribed by Kundrat and is known under his 
name The cell type is a lymphocyte with 
nuclear irregulanttes and vanaDons in size 
and shape of the whole cell and of the 
nucleus It may begm in any part of the 
body There are no changes in the blood un 
til late when anemia may be present 
caused by the systemic effect of the mahg 
nant disease by marrow replacement or in 
most cases by hemolytic anemia frequently 
assoaated with autoantibodies (For a dis 
cussion of autoantibodies see p I66ff ) In 
some cases lymphopenia develops probably 
caused by widespread involvement of 
lymphocytogenic tissues There are rare 
cases with a leukemic picture lymphosar 
coma cell leukemia (Sternbergs leuko 
sarcoma) The sarcomatous blood cells show 
characteristics of cancer cells wuh nuclear 
irregulantles in shape size and staining and 
with several nucleoli Tlie second form is 
systemic from the beginmng but otherwise 
identical with the former Lymphocytic sar 
coma with leukemia is usually a phase of 
or the end stage m the course of lympho- 
cytic sarcoma 

Myeloma (PlasmocytomaJ Develops From 
plasmocellular reticulum cells which arc

lymphocytic myelocytic erythroblastic and 
mixed cell myelomas are not justified There 
are occasional leukemic cases wath vary 
mg numbers of myeloma cells in the car

ning the myeloma is diffuse with general

of the disease differing in the form of the

up to 20 per cent of plasma cells may be 
found in a variety of conditions other than 
myeloma, including metastatic carcinoma, 
djronic granulomatous infections, condi- 
tions linked tvith hypersensitivity, and fol- 
lo^ving administration of cytotoxic drugs. 
On the other hand, they are decreased or 
absent in agammaglobulinemia. 

Leuhemoid Reactions 

Definition. A blood picture that looks like 
leukemia but is not. Here belongs leuko- 
cytosis of 20,000 or higher with a shift to 
the left, or lower counts, even below normal, 
but with considerable numbers of immature 
granulocytes and similar quantitative or 
qualitative changes in lymphocytes. De- 
pending on the predominant cell, leukemoid 
reactions may be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, 
Ijmphocytic, or monocytic. 

Classification 

Congenital. Pelger-Huei’s congenital cell 
defect, a familial trait. Involves failure of 
granulocytes to differentiate beyond the 
band stage and to form segments. It is 
transmitted by a non-sex-linked dominant 
gene. It is more common in some regions 
than in others (Begemann and Champagne, 
1952). The differential count shows oc- 
casional myelocytes and metamyelocytes 
and many band forms. 

Neutrophilic Leukemoid Reactions. I. 
Hemoclastic crisis in hemolytic anemia. 
Normoblasts are commonly present in the 
peripheral blood. 

2. Hemorrhage (^VBC from 50,000 to 
300,000}. 

3. Hodgkin’s disease. Occasional counts 
over 100,000 with many eosinophils. 

4. Various infections 

a. Tuberculosis (lymphocytic leuke- 
moid reactions also possible). 

b Pneumococcus, meningococcus, and 
streptococcus infections; gas gangrene; 
diphtheria; leptospirosis; malaria. 

c. Congenital syphilis (lymphocytic 
leukemoid reaction also possible). 

5. Bums 

6. Eclampsia 

7. Mustard gas poisoning 

8. Vascular thrombosis and infarction, 
e.g., mesenteric thrombosis, tissue necrosis 

9- Marrow replacement by tumors includ- 
ing multiple myeloma and myelosclerosis 
(also eosinophilic, and Ijanphocytlc leuke- 


moid reactions possible). Normoblasts are 
diaracteristically present in the peripheral 
blood. 

30. Myeloid metapbsia in the various 
myeloproliferative diseases 

Eosinophilic Leukemoid Reactions. High 
leukocytosis witli total cell count in leukemic 
ranges and a high percentage of eosinophils 
but with few or no immature cells. Usually 
occurs in cliUdren and may present dif- 
ferential diagnostic problems. As a rule, 
they are not leukemias. The further course 
with subsidence of the eosinophilia solves 
the problem. A parasitic infestation is 
usually the cause. 

Erythroblastosis. Normoblasts in periph- 
eral blood in patients with or without ane- 
mia, frequently with a neutrophilic leuke- 
moid blood picture. The finding of a mod- 
erate anemia with normoblasts in the pe- 
ripheral blood is fairly common in meta- 
static carcinoma involving bone marrow. 

Lymphocytic Leukemoid Reactions. These 
reactions occur in infectious lymphocytosis, 
infectious mononucleosis, pertussis, and 
varicella. 

A leukemoid blood picture may be seen 
in a variety of infections for which vanous 
infectious agents are responsible The re- 
action Is irregular, even with the same In- 
fectious agent. The same microorganisms 
in the majority of cases do not produce this 
land of leukemoid blood picture. Hence, the 
conclusion is drawn that leukemoid blood 
pictures are frequently determined by the 
host reaction 

Myeloblastlc leukemia-like pictures with 
severe anemia, fever, and splenomegaly 
have been seen especially in tuberculosis 
with involvement of lymph nodes and 
spleen. 

The differential diagnosis from leukemia 
is not always easy. Most important is the 
marrow examination, which is more help- 
ful in the differentiation of lymphocytic 
leukemia than of granulocytic. 

The increase of eosinophilic and baso- 
philic granulocytes characteristically pres- 
ent in granulocytic leukemia Is absent in 
the leukemoid blood picture. The leukemic 
hiatus of acute leukemia is absent. 

The alkaline phosphatase cytochemical 
test in neutrophils is weak or negative in 
granulocytic leukemia and positive in non- 
leukemic cells (Kaplow. 1955). The reaction 
is particularly strong in leukemoid reac- 
tions. The values are also high in poly- 
cythemia and myeloid metaplasia

Sometimes only prolonged observauon 
may reveal the true nature of the condition, 
and occasionally the correct diagnosis is 
not made until the autopsy 

Leukopenia 

Definition A reduction of the total leuko- 
cyte count below 5000 ‘Neutropema is a 
decrease In neutrophilic granulocytes below 
2000 per cu mm 

Causes 

Leukopenia is usually due to a drop m the 
number of granulocytes because they arc 
numerically the most frequent while blood 
cells (neutrophilic leukopenia) The life 
span of granulocytes is only a few, days 
Anything that interferes with the produc- 
tion of granulocytes rapidly brmgs about a 
leukopenia Occasionally a lowering of the 
number of lymphocytes may be responsible 
(lymphocytic leukopenia) 

Leukopenia may be transient, as seen 
frequently In early stages of infectious dis 
eases and of localized severe infections 
This has been explained by the depletion of 


Laboratory Mftiiods 

the peripheral circulation of its leukocytes 
which concentrate in the area of the infec- 
tion As soon as the bone marrow catches 
up with the production, the leukopenia is 
replaced by a leukocytosis (Table 4-25)

Some bacteria \iruses and protozoa 
ha\e a direct depressing elTect on the bone 
marrow In o\cnvhelming infections an 
effect similar to paral>sis seems to be 
exerted on the bone marrow 

The leukopenia seen in diseases of the 
b%cr has not been explained saiisfacionly 
Tlie elimination of the dcioxif>ing func 
uon of the liter may play a part 

The same '•drugs that produce a de- 
pressing effect may under other circum 
stances cspcclaU> in smaller doses produce 
a leukocjfosis and under other circum 
stances the effect may be directly on the 
circulating blood and probably of allergic 
nature 

The leukopenia seen in cachexia and m 
dietary Insufficiencies probably has a 
metabolic basis This is suggested by cx 
penraents in animals In which the admin 
Jstratlon of LacloJ acillus easel factor helps 
to correct the leukopenia brought about by 
a protein-dcnctent diet 

The direct cytotoxic action of such agents 
as X ray and radium and of chemicals such 
as nitrogen mustard benzol and others has 
been demonstrated In acute radiauon sick 
ness an initial transient neutrophilic leuko- 
cytosis is followed during the second week 
by leukopenia and neutropema 

The leukopenia of •• splenomegaly of 
vinous types has been attributed to hyper 
spjcnism a bj'potbct/cal concept according 
to ivhlch the spleen exerts a hormonal de 
pressing cffccl on the marrow leading to 
leukopenia thrombocytopenia and anerma 
to any one of the three or to any combina 
tion of the three 

Evidence has been accumulating that 
there are antibodies capable of clumping 
leukocytes of all varieties under proper ex 
penmentil conditions (Icukoagglutimns) 
The data thus far gathered permit a few 
general statements The substance jn the 
serum responsible for the agglutination of 
leukocytes has the charactenslics of an anti 
body It is present in the gamma globulin 
fraction Both group-specific and non 
specific Jeukoagglutinms have been de 
scribed (MoescUm and Schmid 1954) In 
most instances leukoagglutinms were found 
in persons wiih leukopenia which suggests 
that they are an autoantibody (Dausset 


e£ al 1954) Leukopema in the newborn 
may be produced by leukoagglutinms com 
ing from the mother 

Tlie disappearance of the granulocytes 
during aller^c reactions is thought to be 
due to a shift of the cells from the circulat 
ing blood to certain areas involved in the 
allergic reaction Leukopenia in allergic 
rcacuons is set apart from those due to 
marrow depression because the leukocytes 
disappear very rapidly indicating that the 
leukopenia is not due to a marrow depres 
Sion but to a shift of the circulating granulo- 
cytes on an allergic basis 

In various conditions such as metastatic 
carcinoma the leukopenia is due to a re 
placement of the granulocytogemc areas of 
the marrow In Gaucher s disease in per 
nicious anemia and in chrome hemolytic 
anemia the proliferating cells encroach 
upon the granulocytic elements In aplastic 
anemia the damaging agent known or un 
known interferes with the normal granulo- 
cyte producing capacity of the marrow 
Finally there are leukopenias of un 
determined origin Here belong the leuko 
pcnias of lupus erythematosus dissemi 
natus pernicious anemia Addison s disease 
cyclic neutropenia occurring at 21 to 28-day 
intervals and famibai neutropema The 
diagnosis and cause of leukopenia can fre 
qucntly bo made by examining the marrow 
One may find a hyperplastic replaced nor

(Pyramidon) was the first drug to ha\e 
been shoivn to be responsible Later a long 
list of drugs was shown to produce the dis 
ease, including sulfa drugs Some patients 
may deielop se\ere agranulocytosis follow 
jng first administration of the drug or after 
a short penod of administration More frc 
quently signs of disease appear after pro- 
longed administration, especiall) after re 
peated courses In such cases, there are 
at first mild to moderate manifestations 
(skin rash, feter) which warn that the 
drug should be discontinued As a rule 
these patients hate at the same lime leuko- 
penia and granulocytopenia of \ar>ang 
se\enty Consequently periodic leukocyte 
counts may be usefid in recognizing ap- 
proachmg disease 

Pathogenesis Drug allergy The drug is 
thought to acquire antigenicity by combm 
mg with the patients blood proteins This 
results in formation of autoantibodies 
against leukoc>tes and consequently leuko- 
penia The role of allergic hypersensitivity 
IS supported b) observations of acute at 
tacks following the first exposure to a drug 
or of a similar attack in a person who took 
the same drug in the past repeatedly with 
out a reaction 

It IS assumed that the drug combines 
with a protein in the host which imparts 
to the drug anugemc properties This auto- 
anugen stimulates the development of 
autoantibodies against the leukoevtes The 
autoantibodies react with the autoantigen 
when the second dose of the chemical is 
given This mechanism is similar to the one 
described as responsible for the allergic 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (p 179)

myeloblastic reaction complicating agranu 
locytosis 

Autopsy m Rapidf) Fatal Caws. Focal 
necrotic lesions with microabsccsses and 
bacterial colomes without inflammatory re 
active changes around them 

DifTcrcntiil Diagnosis One of the most 
important considerations in the differential 
diagnosis of agranulocytosis is the occa 
sional case that resembles acute granulo- 
cytic leukemia The similarity mav be 
further accentuated by marrow changes 
similar to those of acute leukemia There 
may also be similanty to monocytic leu 
kcmia 

The usual conception is that the lesion 
m agranulocytosis is limited to the gnn 
ulocytogenic portion of the marrow ‘niere 
are those who claim that the damage is 
not limited to the granulocytogenic tissue 
of the marrow, but because of the short life 
span of granulocytes it takes less time for 
the effect of the damage to become notice- 
able It takes weeks before damage to the 
erythrogenic tissue becomes manifest be- 
cause of the long life span of erythrocytes 
Thrombocytes have a very short life span 
but on the other hand megakaryocytes arc 
highly resistant to damage Therefore they 
may produce thrombocytes for a long time 
before the damage advances &ufficienU.Y to 
interfere with their productivity 

In some cases there Is a direct damaging 
or destructive action on granulocytes be 
cause they disappear too rapidly from the 
circulation this would not be the case if 
the injury were only at the bone mirrow 
level When agranulocvtosls persists in 
many cases there is a drop of thrombocytes 
That leads to thrombocytopenic purpura 
combined with agranulocyiosls Still later 
anemia may ensue and pancytopenia re 
suits (also knovvn as panmyelophthisis) 
Then all the formed elements of the blood 
red and while cells and thrombocytes ire 
affected In some cases the marrow Is not 
damaged but on the contrary is cell rich or 
even hyperplastic 

It is possible that the three conditions 
In which the three marrow elements are 
involved are not fundamentaJJv different

entities but different stages of the same 
disease 

There is strong evidence m faior of a 
constitutional factor in agranulocytosis m 
the form of lessened resistance of tiie bone 
marrow to damaging influences (constitu 
tional marrow inferiont^) Families have 
been observed m whom several members 
have been affected by agranulocytosis and 
the other conditions mentioned The ex 
isience of dominant hereditary weakness 
of the granulocjtogemc tissues of the mar 
row has been suggested 

Agranulocytosis, pancylopema, and acute 
leukemias can all be caused by vanous 
agents, such as x ray, radium, benzol, and 
similar substances and certain drugs as 
aminopjrme, arsphenamine, and sulfon 
amides All these drugs have strong anti 
tissue properties They hav e antibiotic, anu 
thyroid, antihistammic, anticonvulsive, and 
various other "anii“ effects The reaction 
to these substances occasionally resembles 
allergic reactions The three diseases can 
not always be differentiated from each 
other by marrow changes 

The Myeloproliferative Syndromes 

Deftnition The hypothesis of the myelo- 
probferauve syndromes is based on the con 
cepuon of the functional umty of the mar 
row. not only horizontally as if functions 
after birth, but vertically by including the 
periods which precede the particlpauon of 
marrow in blood production In fetal life 
The (issues involved in fetal producuon of 
blood may regain their capacity to produce 
blood cells in response to certain stimuli 


This concept is based on the well known 
participation of megakaryocytes m the 
hyperplasia of chrome granulocytic leuke 
mia and of granulocytes and megakaryo- 
cytes HI polycythemia, on the frequent ob- 
servaUon of polycythemia as a precursor of 
granulocytic leukemia, and on many other 
Similar situations 

According to this concept myelofibrosis is 
also a part of this large group, as is extra 
medullary myeloid metaplasia involving the 
Spleen, liver, and other tissues 

As our knowledge of the so-called Di 
Gughelmos disease or erythroleukenua has 
increased, it too seems to fit well into the 
concept consistently and convancingly 
championed by Dameshek (1951, 1958) 
(Dameshek and Baldini 1958) 

The particjpatjon of the vanovs cellular 
elements m the myeloproliferative disorders 
Is shown in Table 4-26

The phagocyte is emhiacing two nuclei The one to the right w th the more uniform structure is the more 
typical A deep indentation appears along the outer periphery of the one closer to the nucleus of the seg

Ftfiure 4~S8 On the left Is a monocyte with a 
pliagDcytiicd pvLnoOc nucleus (to be dilTetentiaied 
from L E cells) On the nght Is a neutrophil with 
a felt liliC purple stalnlnt; mass in the cytoplasm 
(Permission for reproduction from "The Morphology 
of Blood Cells by L W Oigga was obtained from 
Abbott laboratories ) 

tion of the method used in the preparation 
of smears has been found satisfactory 
(Afudrik ) 

1 From each hematocrit tube most of 
fhe serum Js remeved Jeat'ing a edittmn oF 
serum measuring about 5 mm above the 
packed cells 

2 A pjpet is now Inserted 2 mm below 
the lower lc\ el of the serum to remove the 
concentrated leukocytes together with the 
serum (Fig 4-59A) In this way the leuko- 
cytes arc diluted mainly tvich serum result 
mg m & mixture containing relatively few 
erythrocytes 

3 The serum cell mixture from one 
ii'introbe tube Is then placed on a slide 
(Fig 4-59B) AddiUonal preparations can 
be made from each of the other W>ntrobe 
tubes 

4 A second slide is placed diagonally 
upon the senim-cell mixture on sUde 3 
(Fig 4--59C) TTie mixture is allowed to 
spread ^Vhen fibnn is abundant, some pres 
sure should be appbed in order to separate 
the leukocytes from the fibnn threads The 
top slide is then raised abruptly vertically 
from the bottom slide but the slides should 
not be pulled apart bonzontally The bot 
tom slide is held in slanting position (Fig 
4~59D) The erythrocytes and serum How 
toward the edge ivhile the leukocytes and 
fibnn threads (if any) remain in the center 

5 The smaller particles are removed 
tvlth the short edge of a new clean slide and 
are used for the preparation of the final 
smear as follows The short edge of the 
slide to which the matenal adheres is 
placed parallel to the long edge of a second 
shde pushed forward at an angle of ap- 
proximately 5 degrees almost to the edge 
of the horizontal shde (Fig 4-59E) and 
then lowered m such a manner that the 


surfaces of the two shdes come into com 
plele contact (Fig 4-59F) Finally the shdes 
are polled apart with the two surfaces 
mamtaimng contact until separation is com 
pleted When preparing the smears the 
smaller particles rather than the larger ones 
are selected in order to insure more homo- 
geneous preparation 

With this teclimque we have been able to 
observe in positive cases more intact LE 
cells than with the other methods previously 
employed Tlds has been patuciilatly true 
IB patients »vith leukopenia 

The Report The number of the charac 
tenstic ceils is recorded until 3000 gran 
ulocytes have been counted The report 
should make reference to this quantitative 
relation 

The presence of not yet fully transformed 
inclusions (questionable or pre LE cells) 
and of rosettes should be noted although 
they are not diagnostic They indicate the 
need for examining more than 1000 leuko- 
cytes 

Phagocytosis of nuclei with preserved 
chromatin structuie ("tail” cells) need not 
be reported 

This technique is one of several so-called 
direct methods In indirect methods the 
serum comes from the patient and the 
leukocytes come from another person 

Test No 2 (Magatk and WiNKtE 1952) 

1 Prepare the blood sample as for Test 
No I 

2 The clot IS removed and passed 
through a copper wre screen of 30 mesh 
per inch using the bottom of a test tube or 
a pestle A special sieve and pestJe are com 
mercJally available (Scientific Products 
Company) The effect of this procedure is 
twofold the fibrin remams on the sieve 
and some of the leukocytes ate damaged 

3 Tlie Wttate is transferred to several 
Winirobe hematocnt tubes 

Continue with steps 4 5 and 6 as in 
Test No 1 

Test No 3 (ZnntHAM and Conxey 1956) 

1 Ten miJJiIfters of venous blood is 
placed in a tube containmg three drops of a 
1 percent aqueous solution of hepann (de 
livet^ vvith a 21 gauge needle) and ten 
glass beads 4 mm m (fiameter

with steps 4 5 and 6 as m Test No 1 

Test No 4 (Slide Test of Snapper and 
Nathan 1955) 

This IS an mdirect method 
1 A substrate of leul^ocytes is prepared 
by placing a few drops of normal blo^ on 
a ^ass shde ivithm a rubber nng about 
0 8 cm m diameter and 0 2 cm high Two 
such preparauons are made on each dide 
The ^des are placed in a Petn dish the 
bottom of which has been covered by 
moistened filter paper After incubatmg at 
room temperature for one hour the dot 


and nng are removed by pushmg them off 
(without hfong) and the sUde is washed 
with serum to remove the excessive free 
red cells (The use of saline as a wash 
would distort the leukocytes ) The sbdes 
are then dned They have been kept at 
room temperature as long as five vv'eeks 
without losing their potency 

2 In order to test the blood of a sus 
pected patient a small piece of a number 
2 coveiiUp is placed on either side of the 
substrate area as a pillar Then a large 
drop of finger blood is put on a square 22 
mm wide coverslip and inverted over the 
substrate area resting on the glass pillars

Prolonged incubation docs not increase the 
yield of L L cells 

G Centrifuge again as in step 3

The 2 mm erythrocyte column serves to 
prevent the loss of buffy coat during the 
following operation 

B Dcii\er the buITy coal layer io a f^ass

should be taken that no excess plasma Is 
delivered to the slide 

9 Make the smear by placing another 


slide on top of the buffy coat compressing 
gently and pulling slides aw-ay from each 
other at parallel planes Our experience has 
shown that this procedure distributes the 
cells on the L C smears more evenly than 
the conventional method used in making 
blood smears 

10 Stain with Wright or Glcmsa stain as 
usual 

11 If previously drawn venous blood of 
the patient is already available either 
clotted or unclottcd the buffy coat Is con 
ctntriKvJ by means of cenidfugation irans 
ferred to capillary tubes and treated as out 
lined in steps 2 to 10 

12 If only scrum or plasma of (he 
patient is available mix one drop of either 
with buffy coats from two to three capillary 
hematocrit tulics of a normal person incu 
bate the mixture in a capillary lule and 
) rocced as outlined in steps 5 to 10 Buffy 
coat of bone marrovv may also be used but is 
less satisfactory 

The two ahemaie methods outlined in 
steps 11 and 12 make it unnecessary to 
puncture the patient but otherwise the 
regular procedure (steps I to 10) Is yref 
trablc 

Tlic capillary test has several advantages 
(1) It docs not require special equipment 
such as rotating machine or sieve (2) All 
reagents involved m the test come from the 
patient (3) About 10 cu mm of patients 
blood Is needed (A) It can be done m the 
same capillary lubes that ire used for rou 
tine microbcmatocrit determination and 
actually the hematocrit test can be done 
with the same specimen (5) TIic plasma 
L C factor Is incubated chiefly with leuko 
cyics rather than with a mixture consisting 
of considerably larger numbers of erythro- 
cytes than leukocytes as is the case In the 
other tests The erythrocytes take no part in 
the reaction Therefore reducing their num 
her creates a more favorable medium for 
the leukocyte plasma reaction (6) The 
Incubation is performed in a minimum of 
space (less than 10 cu mm ) which facih 
laics phagocytosis (7) After ihe capillary 
lube is broken practically all the formed 
and concentrated L E cells are delivered 
onto a small area of a glass slide 

Tlie capillary test has been si own to be 
highly sensitive and specife in our labora

acid leucocjie-agglutination inhibition, and 
defection of nuclear antibodies by immuno- 
fluorescence technique ha\e been icported, 
but none of them is suitable for clinical use 
as yet 

Specificity of the L E Cell Test 
The L E cell test is positive in most pa- 
tients uith disseminated lupus and m some 
cases of rheumatoid arthritis It has been 
reported in thrombocytopemc purpura and 
rarely in postnecrotic cirrhosis (lupoid cir- 
rhosis) penarteriUs nodosa scleroderma, 
and dermatomyosiiis in sensitization to 
hydralazme peniciUm and tetanus anti 
toxin, in theunvatic. fever miliary tubercu 
losis, erysipelas, and chrome discoid lupus 
erythematosus, and in an assortment of 
other conditions Recenilj such reports 
seem to be less frequent, suggesting that 
faulty interpretation or technique may have 
been responsible for some such reports in 
the past 

^Properties of the L E Factor 
It IS stable in the frozen state and resists 
repeated freezing and thawing It passes 
the Seitz filter It is destroyed by heating 
at 65® C for 30 minutes but resists 60® C 
for 15 minutes It is inhibited by heparm 
in concentrations higher than 0 75 mg per 
10 ml and by alcohol and phenol 
It has been found also in the unne and 
pleural fluid and in the cord blood of chil 
dren of mothers with the disease 

The LE factor is not limited in its 
activity to leukocytes It reacts with nuclei 
of hepatic splenic, and renal cells with 
cancer cells, and inth nuclei of cells of 
various animal species 

The nature of the chemical change in 
volved in the transformation of the nucleus 
has been mdely discussed Various hypoth 
cses have been suggested, such as depoly 
menzation of DNA alteration of the cell 
membrane, and others but agreement has 
not been reached, except for the obvaous 
fact that the LE factor reacts in some 
direct fashion with the nucleus

IMMU>OHEMATOLOCY OF 
RED CELLS 

Red cell antigens are chemical structures 
imparting specific properUes to the surface 
of the red cell and are at present detectable 
only by the reactivity of red cells with 
anuboches corresponding to the antigens 
(homologous anubodies) Most of these 
antigen antibody reactions involve clump* 
mg or aggU(t:nali07i of the red cells There- 
fore the antibodies are called hemaggUt 
ttmns and the antigens heynagglntinogetts 

Isoagglutinogens and isoaggluttrins are 
the antigens and antibodies respectively 
which differentiate red cells of some indi 
viduals from those of others belonging to 
the same species Heteroaggliitimns are 
antibodies that react with red cell antigens 
of different species With few exceptions 
chnical immunohematology deals with 
isoagglutinogens and isoagglutmms It is 
customary to differentiate betiveen "natural” 
and "immune” agglutinins the former term 
applying to agglutinins occurring without 
any known cause such as transfusion or 
injection of blood or other antigenic sub 
stances eliciting antibody formation On 
the other hand immune isoagglutlnms re 
suit from deliberate or umntertlonai im 
mumzation (tsosensitfation) such as may 
occur from injection or transfusion of 
blood or from the entrj of fetal red cells 
into the maternal circulation In addition 
to agglutinauon some hemoantibodies may 
also hemolyze red cells hemolysins (tso- 
hemolysins) Hemolysins are most fte 


quently the result of immunization and are 
much rarer than isoagglutinins 
From the preceding remarks it can be 
concluded that in ad^tion to morphologic 
variations of red cells in health and es 
pecially in disease and in addition to chemi 
cal differences in red cell structure depend 
ent on the presence of variants of hemo 
globin immunohematologic ( serologic’*) 
characteristics predicated on the presence or 
absence of surface chemical properties of red 
cells permit their differentiation and clas 
sification into a large number of «elJ 
defined blood groups as defined by their 
reactions with specific hemagglutinins 
These characteristics of red cells are called 
blood factors They possess three important 
properties they are detectable on the basis 
of specific reactivitj with corresponding 
antibKxlies producing agglutination or lysis 
they are inherited according to Mendelian 
laws and they appear at certain stages of 
fetal development and are full) formed 
either at birth or in early postnatal develop- 
ment and persist throughout life 

At present 11 independent and vvell-de 
fined blood group systems are know n They 
are made up of at least 45 identifiable 
blood factors in addition to which more 
than a dozen other factors have been de 
scribed without being assigned to any sjs 
tern If red cells were to be tested for the 
presence of all these factors several mil 
Hon different phenotypes could be differ 
entiated (Race and Sanger 1958) This 
imparts to blood from different persons an

As can be seen from Table 5-1, immuno* 
logic definition of red blood cells has ad> 
vanced espeaally rapidly dunng the last 
15 years This has been due to a large 
extent to development of new sensime and 
specific techniques for demonstration of 
antigen antibody reactions Some of the 
factors responsible for the continuing 
progress m this branch of immunohema 
tology are the increased use of blood trans 
fusions, the relative ease in procuring ma 
tenal for study, and the fact that results 
of this work have not only proved of great 
cbmeal value but also have contnbuted to 
our knowledge in such basic sciences as 
mununology, genetics and anthropology 

Theory of Blood Group Systetns 

1. The ABO System It is no coincidence 
that the ABO system was the first to be 
discovered This is the only blood group 
system in which plasma and serum regu 
larly contain agglutmins reactmg with 
blood factors present m the red cells of 
other persons Such random interactions of 
serums and red ceU suspensions actually 
were the method by means of which 
Landsteiner demonstrated the presence of 
ABO blood groups In addition to the 
“natural” occurrence of the isoaggluUmns 
two other factors aided the detection of 
isoagglutmation in the ABO system it 


Laboratorv Methods 

occurs over a wide thermal range mcluding 
so called room temperature (20 to 25 C ), 
and isoagglutinms responsible for agglutin' 
ation m the ABO system are of the so called 
complete type, winch means that attach 
nient of the antibody to the red cell possess 
mg the homologous blood factor is followed 
automatically by agglutination 

In his first reports Landsteiner differ 
entiated three types of blood one class was 
not clumped by the serum of any other 
person, and because of this apparent ab- 
sence of agglutinogens this group was 
designated by the numeral “0,” which later 
was converted mto the letter “0 ” A second 
group of blood specimens was agglutmated 
by serums of other persons and was des 
ignated as group A. The red cells of the 
persons whose serums agglutinated group 
A red cells in turn were agglutinated by 
the serums of persons of group A, and 
blood having this isoagglutmogen was 
called group B A few years later a fourth, 
rare type of blood was discovered, the red 
cells of which were agglutinated both by 
isoagglutmins anti A and anti B and which 
therefore was called group AB The prefer 
able terms for designation of isoagglutmms 
are anti A and anti B, as shown by their 
reactivity, instead of older terms, such as 
those usmg Greek letters (a, alpha, and p 
beta) or a and b It is fortunate indeed that 
mtemational agreement has provided for 
acceptance of a uniform (Landsteiner or 
intemaiional) nomenclature according to 
which wc differenuate four groups O, A, 
B. and AB This has ehmmated the use 
of numerical nomenclatures previously pro- 
posed that were arbitrary and much more 
subject to clencal errors and confusion 
Table 5-2 shows the distribution of iso 
agglutinogens and isoagglutinms in the 
ABO system It is apparent that two “laws" 
can be easily formulated the serum of a 
person does not contain isoagglutimns 
capable of agglutmating his own red cells, 
and the serum of a person does contain the

isoagglutinm(s) that react with the iso- 
aggluimogen(s) absent from his red ceUs 

There are considerable variations in the 
reacitvity of the bJood factore Tor example, 
a serum containing antiB when tested 
against a series of specimens of group B, 
may produce agglutinations differing con 
siderably In strength from one specimen 
to the next Teclinical factors tvhich also 
affect rapidity, intensity, and titer of agglu 
tinatlon, will be dealt with later 

Subgrotilis of A In addition to the 
variable agglutinabdity of all blood factors 
certain blood specimens of group A and 
AB are consistently less agglutinable than 
others 

It was shown by means of absorption 
tests that certain weakly agglutinable cells 
of group A are not able lo absorb com 
pletely anti A, whereas complete absorp- 
tion IS accomplished by usmg comparable 
quantities of red cells with strong aggiuun 
ability These observations have been gen 
erally accepted as proof of a qualitative 
dllferencc between the A blood factor in 


strongly and weakly agglutinable red cells 
The majority of group A cells belong to 
subgroup Aj (strongly agglutinable), where 
as the wcakl} agglutinable specimens are 
designated as subgroup A^. Similarly red 
cells of group AB are subdivided into sub- 
groups AiB and A,B Table 5-3 lists the 
relative incidence of subgroups of A includ 
ing rarer subgroups designated as A, A< 
Ao and A„ 

The mam importance of the subgroups 
of A lies in the lesser agglutinabihty of 
A. and A B, for example vvhicii may lead 
to mistakes unless suitable techniques arc 
used A further compHcaiing factor is rep 
resented by the presence of isoaggluilnlns 
in a small percentage of blood specimens 
that react within the group A specifically 
with red cells of other subgroups c g ilie 
scrum of a person of subgroup A- or A,B 
may have anti Ai, agglutinating Ai and 
AfB cells In contrast to anti A and anti B 
which are present regularly according to 
Landsieincrs Jaws (see Table 5-2) tiiesc 
antibodies are found only infrequently and

therefore are called “irregular isoaggludn* 
ms.” They are usually of low titer and can 
be best detected when the agglutination is 
performed at temperatures around 4° C. 
At room temperature and especiaUy at body 
temperature (37° C.) agglutinations by 
these antibodies are weak or absent. Certain 
special features are found in two of the 
rarer subgroups: when red cells of sub- 
group A 3 are exposed to anti-A serum, 
only a small number of red ceDs are ag- 
glutinated, as can be seen especially well 
on microscopic examination. A„ red cells 
are clumped In most instances by anti-A 
in serum of group O but only rarely by 
anti-A present m group B. This phenom- 
enon is not dependent on the titer of the 
isoagglutinins. 

General firoperties 0 / troogg/utiHogeiir 
A and li. By suitable methods the isoagglu- 
tinogens A and B can be demonstrated as 
early as the second month of fetal life. 
However, as a rule they are not completely 
developed at hmth. Speafically, red cells of 
group A or AB of neivbom infants react 
m most instances as if they would belong 
to subgroup A 3 or A36. By the age of one 
year isoagglutlnogens have reached full 
strength. 

Although they were originally discovered 
in the red cells, the term “blood factors” A 
and B IS to a certain extent a misnomer, 
since large amounts of A and B antigens 
are present in tissues other than blood. 
Within the blood itself they are probably 
present also in leukocytes and platelets. 
They are found abundantly in exocrine 
glands, such as the salivary glands and 
pancreas, as well as in the gastric mucosa 
and the Malpighian layer of the skin. 
Demonstration of the antigens in tissues is 
not feasible by agglutination tests but is 
best accomplished by specific absorption of 
added antibody. A and B antigens also occur 
in other species and even in bacteria. It is 
conceivable that introduction of such anti- 
genic material mto the body may be the 
stimulus for formation of isoagglutinins 
early durmg life. 

Highly purified preparations with A and 
B blood group activity have been obtained 
from vanous sources, including human 
meconium. Witebsky, Aforgan and associ- 
ates. and Kabat have made outstanding 
contributions to the elucidation of the 
chemistry’ of A and B blood group sub- 
stances. They are complex polysaccharides 
containing glucosamine and galactosamine, 
immunologic specificity apparently depend- 
ing on relatively small terminal portions of 


Laboratory Methods 

these mapomolecules. Commercially avail- 
able, purified, protein-free preparations of 
group-specific substance A are derived from 
porcine gastric mucosa and those of group- 
specific substance B from equine gastric 
mucosa. Such material has several useful 
applications. First, it can be safely injected 
into sm’table persons in order to elevate 
Uters of isoagglutinins anti-A or anU-B 
for preparation of diagnostic antiserums. 
Second, when added to blood containing 
the corresponding isoagglutinins, A and B 
substances at least partially neutralize these 
antibodies, and this was expected to in- 
crease the safety of group O blood for use 
as “universal donor." That this purpose is 
not always accomplished ivill be discussed 
subsequently (p. 267). Third, group-speci- 
fic substances A and B are of considerable 
usefulness in various laboratory techniques 
to be outlined later (pp. 295, 297). 

SecreloTS of A and B. In addition to the 
previously mentioned wide distribution of 
A and B substances throughout the human 
body, the corresponding blood group specific 
substance(s) are also found in glandular 
secretions, such as saliva and gastric juice, 
of roughly 80 per cent of persons of group 
A or B. respectively. Such persons are called 
“secretors.” In the remaining 20 per cent, 
called “nonsecretors," blood group specific 
substances In tissues axe present only as 
alcohol-soluble compounds, probably In the 
form of lipopolysaccharides. and ^is pre- 
vents their appearance in the aqueous se- 
cretions. On the other hand in tissues of 
secretors blood group specific substances 
occur in alcohol-soluble as well as in water- 
soluble forms. The property of being a se- 
cretor is transmitted genetically and de- 
pends on the presence of at least one of a 
pair of allelic genes designated as Se. 
Persons who are nonsecretors are homozy- 
gous for the gene se (sese). Mecomum of 
fetuses and infants who are secretors con- 
tains large amounts of blood group specifi< 
substance, reflecting concentration of ma 
lenal secreted during fetal hie. 

Isoagghitinins. As inferred from th< 
“laws of Landsteiner," isoaggludnins anti-^ 
or anti-B are regularly present in persons 
lacking the corresponding agglutinogen(s] 
in them red cells. It has been established 
that isoagglutinins develop postnatally 
Isoagglutinins present in the newborn, as 
demonstrable in cord blood specimens, rep- 
resent without exception maternal isoag- 
glutinins transmitted transplacentally. Such 
passively transferred antibodies disappear 
gradually, and as a rule the infant begins 


Blood Groups and 

to produce its own isoagglutinins some 
time between the third and sixth months 
of postnatal life. This strongly suggests that 
the isoagglutinins are the result of some 
subtle antigenic stimulation, possibly 
through microorganisms or food, which 
ineWtably occurs postnatally. Absence of 
isoagglutinins corresponding to an isoag* 
glutinogcn present in the same person may 
be explained by the fact that such anti* 
bodies would be absorbed immediately by 
antigen present in red cells and tissues 
and thus never appear in the circulation. 

Although on the basis of this concept 
the term “natural” isoagglutinins may ap- 
pear to be a misnomer, since they also 
result from some form of antigenic stimu- 
lation, practical considerations make it de- 
sirable to differentiate isoagglutinins devel- 
oping in the “natural” course of events 
from those resulting from specific antigenic 
stimulation. Such antigenic stimulation in- 
cludes transfusion of incompatible blood, 
entry into maternal circulation of red cells 
of a fetus with Incompatible ABO group 
(e.g., a pregnant woman of group O with 
fetus A or B), and administration of group- 
specific substances including antigens 
closely related to A or B, such as those 
present in some bacterial vaccines (teta- 
nus) or horse serum or those that may 
result from infections (E. coll). In these 
instances it can be demonctrated that in 
addition to increase in quantity. antl-A and 
aniJ-B antibodies have acquired certain 
properties that characterize “incomplete” 
antibodies to be described later on (p. 274). 
Ttvo specific properties of incomplete antJ- 
A and anti-B isoagglutinins of considerable 
practical importance are mentioned now. 
First, frequently they possess not only the 
capacity to agglutinate but also to hcmolyze 
red Cells containing the corresponding iso- 
aggluilnogen. Since this hemolysis is de- 
pendent on presence of complement, it Js 
apparent only with use of fresh serum or 
after addition of complement. Inactivation 
at 5G° C. for 30 minutes destroys comple- 
ment and prevents hemolysis while the 
corresponding agglutinin activity remains 
unaffected. Second, although the group- 
specific substances A and B are well ca- 
pable of neutralizing “complete” antl-A and 
anii-B isoaggluiinin. the corresponding “In- 
complete” antibodies are much less readily 
neutralized. Detailed outlines of the proce- 
dures used for demonstrating this prop- 
erty, its practical applications, and inter- 
pretation of the results of such tests will 
be discussed later. 


TiiriR Application 207 

As are most antibodies, isoagglutinins 
anti'A and anti-B are found in the gamma 
globulin fraction. This has acquired a 
certain clinical significance in the dis- 
turbances of plasma proteins extensitely 
studied by Bruton (1952), Good (1056). 
and others, namely, acquired and congen- 
ital h>-pogammaglobu]inemia and agamma- 
globulinemia. As a rule In such conduions 
isoagglutinins normally expected on the 
basis of the person's ABO group arc either 
absent or present in unusually low tilers. 
Hence the absence during routine blood 
grouping tests of an expected isoagglutinin 
in the adult should arouse suspicion of lack 
or decrease in the scrum gamma globulin 
fraction. Rarely isoagglutinins arc present 
only as incomplete antibodies that are no: 
detectable unless appropriate techniques 
arc used (pp. 274ff). The physiologic al>- 
sence of isoagglutinins in the scrum of 
the newborn up to the age of three to six 
months has already been referred to. 

In recent years plant extracts have been 
prepared containing proteins that speci- 
fically agglutinate red cells of certain hu- 
man blood groups. In accord with the rec- 
ommendation of Boyd (1954) these plant 
substances arc called Iccnns. Lectins ca- 
pable of differentlailng between subgroups 
of A arc especially useful. Inasmuch as 
they agglutinate only A| and AjB cells but 
not red cells A... A^B, A-,, and so on. 

Inlierilauce of AtlO groii/u. The funda- 
mental principle of genetic transmission of 
the ABO characters Is based on the fact 
that each of one autosomal chromosome 
pair carries one locus on which one of the 
three alleles — A. B. or O — must be present 
(Fig. 5-1). Table 5-4 lists the resulting 
phenotypes and genotypes and their rela- 
tive frequency in the U.S. Caucasoid jwpu- 
laiion. Three facts dcduciblc from the 
table arc worthy of mention: persons of 
p-oup O are ahv.iys homozygous; persons 
of group AB arc always heterozygous; and 
persons of group A and B may Iw either 
homozygous or heterozygous (ihrir geno- 
types at present not susceptible to determi- 
nation by laboratory tests). In other words 
there Is no reliable rc.agem avaliable by 
means of which the presence of the O 
agglutinogen can be demonstrated In red 
ccHs possessing A or B agclutlriogcn. How- 
etcr. It Is best to avoid Interpreting this 
fact as evidence for genetic "dominance’ 
of A and B mer O, since it only reflects tlic 
lack of suitable reagents Table 5-1 also pre- 
sents information concenilng inheritance 
of phenotypes of subgroups of A and AB.

2 Tlie MVS System By contrast with 
the circumstances relating to the discovery 


of A and B agglutinogens knowledge of M 
and N blood factors was denved from am 
munologic studies of Landsteiner and 
Levme (1927) in which animals of another 
species — rabbits — were injected with hu 
man blood In addition to the expected 
species specific hemoantibodies serums of 
rabbits immumzed with human red cells 
of one person also contained antibodies 
that differentiated between two classes of 
human red cells After such serum was 
suitably absorbed with red cells belonging 
to one class the remaining antibody agglu 
tinated approximately 80 per cent of all 
blood specimens the blood factor present 
m such blood was called "M " Blood speci 
mens not containing the M factor and 
some of the M blood were found to be agglu 
tmated by another antibody present in 
rabbits injected with human red cells free 
of the M factor This second factor was 
called “N " As shown in Table 5-5 there 
are three possible combinations of M and 
N namely either of them may occur alone 
or combmed with the other When onij 
one is present they are homozygotes — 
AIM or NN respectiiely — whereas AIN 
obviously is a heterozygote It is apparent 
that by contrast with the findings in the 
ABO system no red cell can be devoid of 
both M N factors In oUier words in the 
MN system there is nothing corresponding 
to group O m the ABO system Analyses 
of large series of specimens typed for M 
and N showed that incidence of the three 
types — M N and MN — was identical in 
persons of the four ABO groups Thus ABO

and MN groups were proved to be inde 
pendent of each other Two differences 
between the MN and ABO systems are 
worthy of mention M and N factors arc 
present onlj in red cells and certain tissues 
but never in body fluids and secretions and 
isoaggUitinins antlM and antiN are not 
onl> of extremely rare "natural" occurrence 
but arc also hardly ever pioduced as a 
result of isosensitization In such rare cx 
ceptions anti M Isoagglutinins are encoun 
tered ■somewhat more frcqucntl> than anti 
N Only a few cases have been recorded m 
the literature in winch clinical manifcsla 
lions such as transfusion reactions or 
liemoljiic disease of the newborn could 
be traced to anti M or antiN Hence no 
consideration need be given to M and N 
factors m clinical medicine and specifically 
In preiransfuslon tests They arc used in 
medicolegal and anthropologic studies M 
and N are fully developed In red cells at 
birth and are apparently formed at an 
earlier stage of fetal development than A 
and B antigens 

As has been found subsequently in other 
blood group systems the original simplicity 
of the MN system undenvent numerous 
modifications after new data and facts 
became available Weakly reacting fonns of 
M and N have been encountered on rare 
occasions and designated as M " and 
"N " Similar to weakly reacting subgroups 
of A they may be missed because of low 
agglutinabllity and thus give rise to cr 
roneous Interpretations An extremely rare 
third allele of M and N has been described 
and called "M*" (Allen 1958) the presence 
of which fs important in connection with 
exclusion of parentage 

Several agglutinogens discovered during 
the last decade have eventually been found 
to belong to the MN system Two aJJclJc 
factors called "S" and s” (Walsh and 
Montgomery 1947) are regularly associ 
ated with M and N In other words each 
M or N agglutinogen is accompanied by 
and inherited with either the S or s agglu 
Unogen A rare antibody discovered by 
Wiener and Unger (1953) in a Negro pa 
tient and designated by them as anti U was 
subsequently shown to react with all red 
cells containing factors S or s Thus per 
sons capable of forming this antibody lack 
both S and s and presumably are homo 
zygous for a third allele called S" This 
rare blood type occurs almost exclusively 
in Negroes Additional agglutinogens less 
regularly encountered include He and Hu 
first described m African Negroes Also two 


269 

blood factors originally assumed to occur 
only in a few families and called “Mi‘ 
(Levine et al 1951) and Vvv (van der 
Hart Bosman and Van Loghem 1954) 
have been shown to be part of the MNS 
system 

3 The P System Simultaneously with 
the discovery of M and N Landstemer and 
Levine (1927) established by means of 
anti human red cell rabbit serums that hu 
man red cells contamed a factor that they 
called “P" Tins agglutinogen was found to 
be present in roughly 75 per cent of U S 
Caucasoid adults A much higher incidence 
of P positive blood— over 95 per cent — was 
found m Negroes Presence of P is inde 
pendent of ABO MN and other blood 
group systems There are considerable ge 
ncticall) transmitted differences in agglu 
tinability of P positive blood cells Although 
P IS a poor isoantigcn low titered anti P is 
found occasionally in human serum re 
acting best at low temperatures A relation 
ship of the P antigen to Echinococcus has 
been demonstrated patients with this dis 
case were shown to produce high titered 
antt P and injection of echinococcal anti 
gen into rabbits resulted m specific im 
munc scrum (Levine and Cclano 1959) 
Normal serums of some pigs horses and 
rabbits may also contain anti P agglutinin 
The relationship of the Tj* factor to the 
P system which has been established 
within the last few years will be discussed 
In the section on “private and umversal" 
blood factors Clinical implication of P in 
transfusion reactions or other mamfesta 
lions of Isosensitlzation is exceedingly rare 

4 The Jib System The Bh factor hke 
the MN and P blood factors was discov 
ered during animal experimentation Land 
Steiner and Wiener (1940) injected rabbits 
and guinea pigs wuh red cells of the 
Riiesus monkey (Macaca rhesus) to study 
immunologic relationships of higher mam 
mais In addition to expected hemoanti 
bodies for Rhesus red cells the serum of 
rabbits so treated agglutinated approxi 
mately 85 per cent of human red cells The 
significance of this discovery soon exceeded 
by far that of the M N and P factors 
when by fortunate comcidence and even 
more by ingenious reasomng Levine and 
Stetson (1939) and Levine Burnham 
Ibtmn and Vogel (1941) demonstrated a 
rpnicnl sigmficance of the Rh factor that 
neither before nor since then has been 
possessed by any other blood groups ex 
cept the ABO system Specifically hitherto 
unexplained hemolytic complications of

blood transfusions as well as the cause of 
hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythro- 
blastosis fetalis), were shown to be the le 
suit of incompatibihty m the Rh system as 
e\idenced by the finding of Rh isoantibodies 
in human serum mdicative of isosensitiza

ABO system and the MN system In the 
Rh system isoagglutinms are normally ab

blood factor by contrast \vith the sys 
tern On the other hand after red cells con 
taming the Rh factor have been introduced 
mto a person lacking it Rh antibodies de 
velop frequently by contrast vnth the MN 
system 

Extensn e investigations were earned out 
soon after the discovery of the Rh factor 
with outstanding contributions by Wiener 
Levme Diamond Wiiebsky and others in 
this country and Race and Sanger in Eng 
land as well as numerous other workers 
throughout the world Two different sys 
terns of terminology hate det eloped from 
this work one was ongmaUj proposed by 
Wiener, while a different set of notations 
elaborated by Race and Fisher in England 
was generally accepted m England and 
most parts of Europe and is also widely 
used in this country It is not intended to 
discuss the relative merits of the two 
nomenclatures and to present specifically 
the senous objecuons based on principles 
of immunogenetics raised by Wiener 
against the Fisher Race termmology but 
the fact remains that both nomenclatures 
haie today become firmly estabhshed in 
different parts of the world For this rea 
son anybody working in the field must be 
familiar wth both of them In this presen 
tation the recommendations by a commit 
tee appointed by the National Insututes of 
Health in 1949 have been followed ic 
to use the notations pf Wiener with the 
Fisher Race notations added In parentheses

the early work the conclusion was justified 
that the populauon could be divided Into 
two mam groups one with red cells that 
were agglutinated bj Rh antibodies and 
called Rh positive and another with red 
cells that were not agglutinated and called 
Rhnegatiie However further work soon 
disclosed the presence of at least two other 
Rh factors This situation is similar to the 
one previously discussed for the associa 
non of S and s with M and N blood factors 
The most important Rh factor was desig 
nated as Rh^ by Wiener and as D b> Fisher 
and Race The two factors frequently asso- 
ciated with Rha(D) were named rh'(C) 
and rh"(E) When suitable tests are done 
for these three factors it is possible to 
differentiate eight different types as shown

antibodies react with Rh factors the exact

p 28 d) it was always possible to demon

pregnancy is concerned Reference will be 
made in subsequent sections (p 301) to 
procedures for selection of blood for trans 
fusions or prenatal testing in order to avo d 
erroneous identification of D positive blood 
as Rh ncgiiive 

The strength of D" antigens varies greatly 
from one specimen (o the next — from strong

In addition to D" factors which arc 
transmitted genetically another form of 
weakly reacting Rh,(D) factor has been 
encountered that results from i “gene Inter 
action” namely the rh (C) factor which 
depresses the reactivity of the Rh (D) anti

exclusion of parentage since scemingh 
Rh negative parents mav glvL rise to an

and Sanger (1958), it may reflect a gene 
deletion and has bwn found to be inherited. 
Red cells with this factor, even when pres- 
ent in heterozygous form, have the unusual 
property of being agglutinated even in sa- 
line suspensions by incomplete anti-Rh 
serums (see p 274). The practical signif- 
icance of -D- is predicated on serious 
difficulties encountered in transfusing per- 
sons witli tliis Rh type, because they are 
capable of, and frequently do, develop anti- 
bodies for the other Rh factors: rh'(C) 
and hr'(c), rh"(E), and hr"(e). Therefore, 
blood donors used for them must have the 
same rare Rh type as they themsdves. 
Implications of the -D- factor for exclusion 
of parentage will be discussed later (see 
p. 316). 

Discoveries by Unger and Wiener (1957) 
have acquainted us with additional factors 
complicating the Rh system. Several ob- 
servations were reported of apparently Rh* 
-(D)-positlve persons who formed anti- 
bodies reacting specifically with all other 
Rh,,' (D) -positive cells except their own, 
but this has now been explained by attrib- 
uting a mosaic nature to the Rh* (D) factor. 
Very rarely Rho-positive blood specimens 
may occur in which one small part of this 
mosaic is missing. Such blood specimens 
have been designated as Rh*, Rh’’, and 
Rh', and their possessors are thus capable 
of forming antibodies against the A, B, or 
C portion of Rh*, such antibodies aggluti- 
nating "regular” Rh-positive blood speci- 
mens carrying these segments of the “mo- 
saic.” 

Antigenicity of Ilh factors. In medicine 
the significance of blood factors is based 
on their capacity to isosensiiize In transfu- 
sions or pregnancies. The Rh„(D) factor is 
by far the most antigenic, and the other 
Rh tactoTS are much less likely to produce 
isosensiiization. Antibodies for rh'(C) are 
frequently found together with anii-Rh*(D) 
antibodies in the Rh-negaiiv^ pregnant 
woman whose fetus or child was type Rh, 
and hence possessed both antigens. A simi- 
lar combination of anti-Rha(,D) and anti- 
rh"(E) antibodies occurs less frequently Jn 
women subjected to antigenic stimulation 
by a fetus with type Rh.(cDE). Rarely 
factors other than Rh„(D) Induce forma- 
tion of antibodies in Rh-posiUve persons, 
their antigenicity decreasing in the follow- 
ing order: hr'(c), rh"(E), rh'(C), and hr''' 
(e). By contrast with A and B factors, Rh 
factors have not been unequivocally demon- 
strated outside of blood cells, which Ihetc- 


273 

fore are the only agent capable of bringing 
about Rh sensitization. In addition to preg- 
nancy and blood transfusions, intramus- 
cular Injection of blood may be responsible 
for development of Rh antibodies. 

tth antibodies. iVith exceedingly rare 
exceptions Rh antibodies do not occur with- 
out preceding antigenic stimulation, such 
as sensitization by pregnancy, blood trans- 
fusion, or deliberate immunization consist- 
ing most commonly of repeated intravenous 
injections of blood. Heteroaniibodies agglu- 
tinating Rh-positive red cells can also be 
produced in guinea pig.s injected with 
Rhesus monkey or human blood, but the 
reliability of such antiserums was found 
to be inadequate for practical use. 

Soon after discovery of the Rh factor it 
was noted that Rh antibodies were delect- 
able only in approximately 5C to 70 per 
cent of patients with hemolytic transfusion 
reactions or women with erythroblasiotic 
infants. Incubating the serum-red cell mix- 
tures for prolonged periods of time at 37® C. 
increased the sensitiv'ity of tests for Rh 
antibodies but stOl failed to demonstrate 
the presence of Rh antibodies in many in- 
stances In which they were expected on the 
basis of clinical findings. These contradic- 
tions between serologic and clinical findings 
necessitated a search for new and more 
sensitive hemaggluthiatlon techniques ca- 
pable of detecting hemoantibodics reacting 
differently from those known heretofore, 
such as anii-A, anti-B, anti-M, and anti-N. 
The term "complete” antibodies Is recom- 
mended for those that react readily with sa- 
line-suspendcd red cells and do not require 
special procedures except certain periods 
of incubation or centrifugation (sec Table 
5-9). The classical examples for such anti- 
bodies arc isoagglulinins anti-A and anti-B. 
Optimal temperatures for these antibodies 
vary with the specific antibody, but as a 
rule they are “cold agglutinins,” the highest 
titers being observed around 4 ® C. Higher 
reactivity at 37° C. is exhibited by anti- 
bodies presumably Induced by specific anti- 
genic stimulation, such as complete Rh 
antibodies, which may be c.nlJcd "warm 
agglutinins." Finally a third class of iso-

results may be obtained when low titered 
antibodies are tested at temperatures far 
from their optimal thermal range 

Hemoantibodies not readily detectable 
when added to sabne suspended red cells 
contauung the corresponding agglutinogen 
are best called “incomplete " One of the 
fundamental properties of incomplete anti 
bodies IS the capacity to unite readily with 
homologous antigemc sites on the cell 
but without manifest agglutination One of 
the first methods for detecting the presence 
of incomplete antibodies was based on the 
assumption that antigenic sites occupied 
by incomplete anubodies could not be 
available for combination with complete 
anubodies Hence red cells first expos^ to 
incomplete antibodies should fail to be 
agglutmated when subsequently exposed to 
complete anubodies of the idenUeal speci- 
ficity The coTiectnesss of this reasoning 
was proved experimentally (Wiener, 1944) 
Although this method has a rather low 
sensitivity, it is important because it fur- 
nished proof for one of the basic properties 
of incomplete anUfaodies— union with an 
antigen that prevented reacUon tvith cor- 


responding complete anubodies — which led 
to their designation as “blocking annbod 
ics” Bactenal anubodies of this type haie 
been known from previous studies The) 
have recently been mvestigated more in 
tensively 

A second, more sensitive method for dem- 
onstration of mcomplete antibodies, fre 
quently used for practical work (p 290). 
consists of substituuon for the saline medi- 
um by macromolecular substances, such as 
human serum or plasma, serum proteins 
especially serum albumm, as well as other 
colloidal soluuons. such as gelatin, gum 
acacia, and polyvinyl pyrrohdone (PVP) 
In other words, when Rh positive red cells 
suspended m albumm are added to a serum 
containing mcomplete Rh anubodies, ag 
glutination occurs after suitable periods of 
incubauon or other procedures (centnfu 
gation, warming on slide) This method is 
apparently based on the fact that molecular 
configurations of incomplete antibodies 
differ from those of complete antibodies 
thus necessitating the presence of a medi 
um m which the electrostauc forces repel 
ling red cells from each other can be over

Blood Grouis and 

come more readily than is the case in saline 
media Many practical applications such as 
Rh typing (see p 283) make use of this 
property of incomplete antibodies 

A third method with a wide range of 
practical applications m immunohcmatol 
ogy and immunology is the antiglohulm test 
dc^ eloped by Coombs 

v/^lnfigfobiihn (Coojnbs)^tesl There are 
tuo basic premisesTor the correct under 
standing performance and application of 
antiglobulm tests First human isohemo 
antibodies are globulins in most instances 
gamma globulin Second addition of anti 
globulin antibody to human red cells coated 
with isoantibody (le globulin) results In 
agglutination of the coated red cells For 
practical purposes such antiserums (ami 
human globulin serum) may be produced 
by injection of human globulin into ani 
mals of a vanety of species rabbits and 
goats are most commonly employed Figure

of c%cn(s in the antiglobuhn test In (he 
first step (I) incomplete antibodies unite

occur m vwo or in ritro The second step 
(11) addition of the antiglobuhn reagent 
IS folloued by the final event (HI) agglu 
tination of the globulin coated red cells 
There arc two main applications of the 
antiglobuhn test (1) The direct antiglobu 


Their Appucation 

lin test is designed for demonstration of tn 
tipo coating of red cells Basically a positive 
test shows agglutination of the suitably 
prepared red cell suspension after addition 
of the antiglobuhn serum The main indi 
cations for this test are diagnosis of hemo- 
lytic disease of the newborn (p 311) and 
of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (p 312) 
and investigation of hemolytic transfusion 
reacnons (p 305) (2) In the indirect anti 
globulin test incomplete antibodies are per 
mitted to react in vitro with red cells con 
taintng the corresponding agglutmogen 
after suitable periods and conditions of in 
cubation of the red cell serum mixtures 
antiglobuhn serum is added to the suitably 
prepared red cells The mam applications 
of the indirect antiglobuhn test are 

a Detection of Incomplete antibodies 
(eg incomplete antiKh^CD)) by means 
of Incubation of Rh„(D) positive red cells 
with the serum to be tested Analogous pro 
cedurcs may be used for incomplete anti 
bodies of other specificities including anti 
A and anti B 

b Detection m red cells of blood factors 
for which homologous antibodies are avail 
able in the incomplete form either ex 
clusively or prevalently eg Kell and 
Duffy (p 287) This method is also used 
for demonstration of weakly reacting Rh„ 
variants (D" seep 284)

d Antiglobuhn reactions also may be 
used for demonstration of other antigen

platelets and tissue cells 

e Smce addition of gamma globubn 
neutralizes antiglobuhn antibody and thus 
prevents the aggluUnatmg activity of anti 
globulm for coated red cells the test has 
also been adapted to demonstrate the pres 
ence of hypogammaglobulinemia and agam 
maglobulinemia 

Ettzyme treat/neut of red cells In the 
most recent method developed for detec 
tion of mcomplete antibodies red cells 
treated with proteolytic enzymes such as 
trypsin papain ficm and b rome hn become 
agglutin^le by incomplete antibodies in a 
similar fashion as would be expected from 
complete antibodies In other words mcom 
plete antibodies are capable of agglutmat 
mg saline suspended enzyme treated red 
cells possessmg the homologous blood fac 
tors The enzyme techmques are fairly sim 
pie their results are easier to read than 
those in some of the other methods for de 
tection of incomplete antibodies and they 
exceed them also in sensitivity as far as 
detection of Rh antibodies is concerned 
On the other hand some antigemc sites of 
other blood factors are destroyed or mark 
edly weakened in reactivity after enzyme 
treatment and hence this technique cannot 
be employed for detection oi antibodies for 
M N Duffy and some other blood factors 

Thus It is often necessary to utilize sev 
eral of the techniques for detection of in 
complete antibodies for Rh and other blood 
factors referred to in the preceding dis 
cussion and summarized m Table 5-9 No 
final decision is possible at present as to 
whether different methods (anOglobuhn 
tests blocking tests and enzyme tests for 
example) are detecting the same or dif 
ferent varieties of incomplete antibodies 
The latter possibility is considered bkely 
by many investigators and would thus rep 
resent another mstance of "heterogeneity 
of antibodies which has been estabbshed 
for certain serologic phenomena 

Sfieafictty of Rh nuttbodies Dependmg 
on the antigemc compositions of the in 
jected red cells and of the red cells of the 
recipient antibodies with specifiaty for 
one or more Rh factors may be present in 
the same serum The following general con 
ditions must be met in isoimmunization to 


Rh factors or for that matter to any other 
antigen the blood factor must be absent 
in the sensitized person the blood factor 
must be present in the sensitizing blood 
and the blood factor must he of sufficient 
antigemc strength Other factors are the 
number of separate antigemc stimulations 
the amount of blood invoh ed in each stun 
ulation the tune intervals between stunu 
lations and the individual variations in 
abihty to produce antibodies In Ime with 
the preceding statements about relative 
antigemcity antiRh„(D) antibodies arc 
most commonly encountered Rli negative 
women bearing fetuses with type Rhi 
(CDe) have also an opportumtj to form anu 
bodies to rh(C) an event occumng in a 
majority of such pregnanaes If on the 
other hand a woman happens to be rh 
(Cde) herself pregnancy with an Rhj 
(CDe) fetus makes possible only formation 
of anuRha(D) Such examples could be 
multiplied and apply equally to sensitiza 
tion by blood transfusions Knowledge of 
exact specificity of isoantibodies is impor 
tant for two reasons for selection of blood 
transfusions for isoimmunized recipients 
including treatment of erythroblastotic 
babies and for proper utilization in lab* 
oratory tests of antiserums which may con 
tain more than one antibody Another Im 
portant consideration concerns the possibi! 
ity that antibodies with different specificity 
may also have different reactivity as de 
in the preceding section e g a serum 
may contain antiRhnCD) as 
antibody and anu rh (C) as complete anti 
body Hence the selection of tecliniques 
used for detection of such anUbodies is of 
cntical importance As will be discussed in 
connection with antibody identification 
testmg for specificity of Rh antibodies re 
quires availabihty of red cell panels which 
on the basis of their antigenic composiuon 
permit discrimination between anUbodies 
of different specificity 

luheutaoce of Rh factors In general 
the inhentance of Rh factors follows the 
same principles as those discussed in con 
nection with the ABO and MN factors 
Rh factors present in any one mdividual 
must have been inherited from one or both 
of his parents If for example a person 
inherits the rh (C) factor from both par 
ents he is homozygous rh rh (Cde/Cde) 
On the other hand a person heterozj gous 
for rh (C) has only one parent of ivpe ih 
(Cde) while the other may be Rh negative 
(cde) his genotype is rh rb(Cde/cde) 


Blood Groups and Thpir Aiplicvtion 


Table 5-8 lists the genotype and gene nota 
tions according to the Wjencx and Fisher 
■Race nomenclatures 

Three facts must be stressed in connec 
lion with Rh genotypes First laboratory 
tests arc limited to determination of geno- 
types for factors rh (C) and rh (E> and 
tliC) cannot establish homoz^ gosity or heter 
ozygosuy for factor Rh„(D) Second e\en 
when homoz>gosU) or heterozygosity for 
one of the Rh factors has been established 
there is frequently uncertamti as to loca 
lion of the genes on the two chromosomes 
e g a person found to be Rh,Rh hr' positive 
and h^ positive (CcDEe) may belong to 
one of six genotypes (cf Tabic 5-8) Third 
the most reliable evidence for presence of 
a specific Rh genotype is derived from 
knowledge of Rh types of parents and off 
spring of the person under test In most 
other situations one can only refer to the 
most probable genotype on the basis of 
statistical information relating phenotypes 
to genotypes in populations of known ethnic 
background In Table 5-10 the ppobabihty 
for association of the most common pheno- 
types of Rh positive persons with hcierozy

gositv has been estimated on Uie basis of 
the distribution of Rh types in the U S 
Caucasoid population 

Information on the genotype is of prog 
nostic value in cases of husbands of women 
sensitized to one of the Rh factors Knovvl 
edge of inheritance of Rh factors is indis 
pcnsable for interpretarion of Rh types in 
connection with exclusion of parentage as 
discussed subsequently (p 315) 

5 The Kell Duffy and Kuld Blood 
Group Systems Factors making up these 
systems have been discovered relatively re 
cently and instances of hemolytic disease 
of the newborn or hemolytic transfusion 
reactions have furnished the opportunity 
for discovery of a new antibody penrut

factor The basic information concerning 
llie incidence of Kell Duffy md Kidd blood 
factors m the U S Cauciso d population is

poses one should be aware of the following 
characteristic features of these two sys 
terns

genic That anti Kell antibodies are not 
found more frequently as a result of iso- 
sensitization by transfusion or pregnancy 
IS explained by the low incidence of Kell 
in the general population Since as a role 
at least t\\o antigemc sumulations are 
necessary for de\elopment of antibodies, 
chances for a Kell negative person to be 
sensitized (e g , by two blood transfusions 
with Kell positive blood) are less than one 
in 100 

2 Sensitization to the Cellano factor 
(k) occurs extremely rarelj because rougbli 
only one out of 1000 persons is susceptible 
to such sensitization by virtue of being 
homozygous for the Kell factor (KK) 

3 The Duffy factor Fy*, is only vreaUy 
antigemc and hence corresponding anti 
bodies are encountered only infrequently 
This holds true to an even greater extent 
for the allele, Fy*', and anabodies for Jk» 
and Jk** 

4 As a rule antibodies for Kell, Duffy, 
and Kidd factors are best or exclusively, 
detectable by the mdirect antiglobulm 
technique This is important in connection 
with crossmatching tests, which may fall 
to reveal incompaubility caused by such 
antibodies if this technique is nor employed 
Some examples of Kidd antibodies react 
best tvith enzyme treated red cells subjected 
to the antiglobulin technique On the other 
hand the Duffy agglutmogens are readily 
destroyed by proteolytic enzymes such as 
trypsin papain and £an and hence such 
techniques are unsuitable for detection of 
Duffy factors and anti Duffy antibodies 

5 Within the last years the Kell system 
has become more complex with the dis 
covery of additional alleles designated as 
Kp* and Kp' which are associated with K 
and k in a similar fashion as are rb'(C) 
and rh"(E) with Rh„{D) Antibodies for 
these new factors are so rare that one need 
not consider them in everyday laboratory 
work 

6 Considerable racial vanations have 
been established for Kell Duffy, and Kidd 
factors For example in U S Negroids the 
mcidence of Kell positive persons is much 
lower — 2 per cent — than among U S Cau 
casoids (Table 5-11) In the Duffy system. 
Negroids are found whose blood possesses 
neither of the Fy"— Fy^ factors but they 
may carry mstead a hypothetical third 
allele The frequency of the Jk* factor os 
greater m the U S Negroid (over 90 per 
cent) than m the U S Caucasoid popula 
non 

7 Family studies have shown Kell, 


Labor VTORV Methods 

Duffy, and Kidd factors to be inherited ac 
cordmg to Mendehan genetics and to be 
mdependent of the other blood group sys- 
tems 

6 The Leuis Blootl Group System 
In this system two blood factors, detectable 
by their correspondmg antibodies are 
called Le* and Le’ Both are seen frequently 
as “natural” antibodies of low titer. In 
some mstances they possess hemolytic ac 
tivity and, if present in high concentration 
may be responsible for complications in 
blood transfusions 

All Le* positive persons, which make up 
about 20 per cent of adult Caucasoids have 
been found to be nonsecretors of group- 
specific substance, A and B 

Although m adults the incidence of Le“ 
posmve individuals is 20 per cent a much 
higher incidence (80 per cent) is found in 
newborns To explain this discrepancy, it 
has been suggested that in adults anti Le* 
reacts only with red cells homozygous for 
the Le* factor, whereas m newborn and 
young infants heterozygous red cells 
(Le* Le**) also give positive reactions This 
bv contrast with other blood factors repre* 
sects an example of recessive inhentance 

A certain percentage of Wood specimens 
the frequency varying in different xaaal 
groups possesses neither Le* nor Le** fac 
tors While among Caucasoids this blood 
type is found in about 6 per cent it reaches 
much higher proportions among Negroids 
Such persons are capable of fonnmg anu 
bodies for both Le* and Le** 

7 The Lutheran Blood Group System 
The factor Lu» occurs in approximately 8 
per cent of Caucasoids More recently its 
allelomorphic factor, Lu*’, also has been 
discovered by its corresponding antibody 
Lu** IS present in all Lu* negative and m th 
majonty of Lu* positive individuals Sino 
Lutheran anbbo^es occur rarely and ar 
low titered complete antibodies their elm 
ical significance Is exceedingly hnuted 
Only exceptionally has antiLu'* been ini 
plicated m transfusion reactions Evidenct 
for linkage of Lutheran genes to sccreto: 
genes has been presented 

8 Other blood factors In addition tc 
the nine blood group systems discussec 
so far and summarized in Table 5-1 ^ 
number of other blood factors discovered ir 
recent years require more studies befort 
tbcir final classification Some of these faC' 
tors w ere onginally found only m mem^rs 
of one family — “pnvate” or “family’ 
tors The opposite behavior, namely almwt 
universal occurrence, has been reported for 



IlLOon Gkouis and 

other blood factors that were absent in 
only one or a fc« individuals familial dis 
tnbiition of the absence of such factors was 
observed and indicates a genetic mcch 
anlsm 

In the course of further studies one of 
three developments may eventually take 
place with the “ntw” blood factors they 
may turn out to belong to one of the nine 
known blood group systems they may 
found to represent new independent blood 
group systems the mam factor showing 
much greater frequency in some ethnic 
groups than in others or they may remain 
"family factors " possibly attributable to 
rare mutations 

Examples of the first evenmality — assign 
meiit to "old blood group systoms of blood 
factors originally considered to be "family 
factors" — are hli* and Vvv which have 
been recognized as belonging to the MNS 
system A particularly interesting example 
In this category Is the universal factor Tj» 
the absence of which was first discovered 
by Lev mo (J951) in a patient whose scnim 
v-as found mcompauble with all blood 
specimens of the same ABO group tested 
except her own and that of her sister This 
property called Tj'ncgauve" was subsc 
quently encountered In approximately 20 
other persons from ten families residing 
In different pans of the world Sanger 
(19S5) noted that all Tj* negative persons 
litre also P negative and was able to prove 
the association of Tj* with the P system 
In all Tj* negative persons tested so far 
anti Tj* antibody wis present in the serum 
even though there was no known previous 
antigenic stimulation Anti Tj» in most in 
stances acts as hemolysin in the presence 
of complement 

Other factors of universal distribution arc 
Ve I and 'yt* In this connection Jr should 
be noted that serums of persons possessing 
antibodies for the blood factors U (MNS 
system) Ccllano (k) Lu*" and hr* (c) will 
be found to agglutinate more than 98 per 
cent of random blood specimens tested and 
thus may at first glance arouse the sus 
picion that they arc antllxidics for one of 
the universal blood factors Obviously such 
findings pose serious difficulties In con 
nection with blood transfusions and their 
solution requires cooperation of minv blood 
banks !n such situations the “rare blood 
donor file " established b\ tlic American 
Association of Blood Banks inav prove val 
uablc 

Tlie second trend— development of a new 
blo^ group system — is exemplified by tlie 


Tiifir Vmucatios 270 

Diego factor (Di») which was originally 
discovered in one single famih but subsc 
quciiUy was shown to occur with frequen 
cies of up to 10 to 45 per cent in certain 
populations such as among certain South 
and North American Indians and in Mon 
golotd populations (China Japan) Simi 
larly the rcccntlv discovered Sutter blood 
factor (Js*) is present in a suable proper 
non of U s> Negroids but exceedingly rare 
in other races 

Additional “family blood factors" iiave 
been reported Their clinical importance is 
based on their ciiologic role in isolated in 
stances of hemolytic disease of the newborn 
and complications of blood transfusions

Blood Groups and Their Application

2 Prepare a 2 per cent suspension in 
saline of the red cells of the unknown 
specimen 

3 For each specimen 6 test tubes are 
labeled shomng in addition to proper 
identification of tbe unknown specimen the 
foUoiving information Tube 3 — aniiA 
tube 2 — anti B tube 3 — anti A B tube 4' — 
A tube S-'B tube 6—0 

4 Place one drop of the anti A serum 
into tube 1 pne drop of the antiB serum 
into lube 2 and one drop of the anti A B 
serum onto tube 3 

5 Add two drops each of the serum of 
tbe unknown specimen to tubes 4 5 and 6 

6 Add one drop each of the 2 per cent 
red cell suspension In saline of the un 
known specimen to tubes 1 2 and 3 

7 To tube 4 add one drop of a 2 per 
cent red cell suspension m saline of group 
A cells to tube 5 add one drop of a 2 per 
cent red cell suspension m saline of group 
B cells and to tube 6 add one drop of a 
2 per cent suspension of red cells in saline 
of group 0 cells 

8 Mix the contents of all tubes by shak 
ing the test tube rack 

9 Depending on the speed necessary for 
completing the test one of tuo alternatives 
may be chosen 

a The test tubes may be left at room 
temperature (20 to 2 d® C ) for at least 
two hours 

b After Hso to three minutes the lubes 
may be centrifuged (one minute at 1500 
r p m in clinical centrifuge or one half 
to one minute in Serofuge or Hemofuge) 

10 After incubation or centrifugation 
the red cell suspensions are redispersed by 
tapping the tubes Presence of agglutination 
IS checked with the naked eye svith the 
scanning lens of a microscope and if 
results are doubtful or negatue micro- 
scopically (16 mm objectue) after placing 
a drop on a slide 

11 All results are immediately entered 
m the proper work record using prefer 
ably "plus" signs for agglutination and 
‘Minus’* signs for absence of agglutination 

Interpretation 1 The results of 
an ABO grouping test can be accepted as 
lalid only if tbe findings obtained in the 
first three lest tubes with known antiserums 
agree with those obtained in the second 
three test tubes ivith known red cell sus 
pensions this second pan of the test is 
called "confirmation "checA." or “rc>crsc'’ 
grouping Figure 5-3 schematically com 
pares the results in the four mam ABO 
groups in such tests when both the un 


known red cells and the unknown serum 
are tested If at all possible it is desirable 
that two different persons perform ABO 
groupings one testing ivitn knowm anti 
serums and the other with known cells 
After they have completed the tests and re 
corded their readings independently the 
results should be compared for final in 
lerpretation 

2 Absent or weak agglutination with the 
unknown serum may be simulated by hemol 
ysis of the known red cells this suggests 
the presence of hemolytic anti A or antiB 
antibody It is important to record such 
findings (using the letter “H” for hcmolv 
sin) smee they affect significantly the 
selection of blood to be used as universal 
donor or for transfusion of "unuersal re 
cipienis" Tlie assumption that hemolysis 
IS due to anti A or anti B mus be confirmed 
by repeating the test with the serum after 
Its mactivauon in a water bath at 56® C 
for 30 minutes use of the inactuated 
serum is expected to result in agglutination 
instead of hemolysis 

3 If discrepancies in tbe two parts of 
ABO grouping are observed the test should 
be repealed in order to rule out some mis 
take in the previous test If a second test 
reveals the same discrepancy the following 
possibilities are to be considered 

a Cold agglutinins They may cause 
agglutination of the Inown cells by 
the unknown serum regardless of Us 
ABO group This must be confirmed 
by testing the unknown serum with us 
own red cells at 4® C for 1 to 2 hours 
Under these conditions cold agglutin 
IDS produce agglutination which dis 
appears after transfer of the specimen 
to a water bath at 37® C for 5 to 10 
minutes (For further tests for cold 
agglutinins see p BQOff ) 
b Agglutinauon of the unknown 
red cells by known antiserums that 
conflict with the results obtained in 
the confirmation grouping may be due 
to coating of (he red cells bv ai to 
antibodies Confirmation of this phe 
nomcnon Is obtained by performing 
on the unknown red cells the direct 
antlglobuhn (Coombs) test and ob- 
taming positive results In order to 
obtain in such caves a rclnhle \BO 
grouping the red cells should lie 
washed several limes with largo 
amounts of physiologic saline soUnion 
following which they art more likely-^' 
to give adequate results /r

the suspensions of the known red ceils 
This must be \cnficd b> demonstra 
lion of such irregular antibodies (see

d Discrepancies bctuccn the two 
parts of ABO grouping tests may be 
found in specimens of subgroups of 
A and AD Most commonly these are 
specimens of group A or A-B con 
tiimng anti A, in their scrums Thus 
agglutination of the unknown red cells 
with anti A scrum may be associated 
with agglutination of known group A 
red cells by the unknown scrum Clarl 
ficatlon in such cases Is obtained by 
establishing the subgroup of A of the 
specimen (see p 283) and by testing 
the unknoirn serum with suspensions 
of A) and A^ cells Tiic latter tist 
should be done at room temperature 
as well as at icc box temperature since 
these antibodies as a rule act best at 
low temperatures Group O cells roust

nonspecific cold agglutinins 
c As mentioned previously scrums 
of newborn and young Infants may not 
contain the Isoagglutinlns expected 
from the reactivity of their red cells 
<cf p 2GG) Hence in Infants use of the 
unknown serums is not a reliable pro 
cedurc (cf crossmatch tests p 302) 
Much less frequently isoagglutinlns 
may be absent in older children and 
adults because of hyiiogammaglobulin 
cmla or agammaglobulinemia or for 
unknown reasons 

Comments 1 It is recommtnded to 
place the scrum into the test tube first and 
to follow with addition of the red cell sus 
pension In this wav the error of omlttinc 
addition of the serum can lx? avoldevl 
2 The red cell suspensions of croups

2 Mark the left side of a clean glass 
sbde “anti A” and the right side anti B 

3 Add to the left side a drop of anti A 
grouping serum and to the right side a drop 
of anti B grouping serum 

4 Next to the drops of anti A serum 
and anti B serum add one drop of 
the 10 per cent suspension of the unknown 
red cells Be careful not to cause confluence 
of the drops on the left and right sides of 
the slide 

5 With one half of an applicator stick 
muc the red cell suspension with the anti A 
serum and with the other half mix the red 
cell suspension with the anti B serum 

6 Gently rock the shde back and forth 
and observe the mixture for one minute 
unless agglutination occurs earlier 

7 Enter the results as “plus” tor agglu 
tination and as nunus“ for absence of 
agglutination 

8 It IS necessary to confirm the slide 
grouping by testing the unknown scrum 
with the known red cell suspensions of 
groups A B and 0 as indicated in the 
previous section 

Comments 1 Instead of a 10 per 
cent red cell suspension small drops of 
blood obtained directl) from skin punctures 
or whole oxalated or citraied blood not 
older than 24 hours may be used In such 
cases one must avoid adding excessive 
, amounts of blood to the antiserum smce 
this may interfere with adequate reading 
of the test and also may produce falsely 
negative results because of antigen excess 

2 Slow and weak agglutinations may 
occur with blood specimens of subgroups 

' A A^B A< A-{B and so forth This may 
result in falsely negative readings since 
drying of the mixture may take place before 
the agglutination becomes clearly visible 

3 In some blood banks it is customary 
to do a preliminary ABO grouping for the 
donor record by adding to a drop of anti A 
and anti B serum one drop of blood from 
a skin puncture of the prospective donor 
Results of such tests must be considered 

^ preliminary since a certain percentage of 
^ weak subgroups of A md AB may be erro 
neously classified as O and B respectively 
s 3 Deterimnnftoti of subgrou/w of A

men 

3 Let stand at room temperature for 15 
minutes 

4 Centrifuge for one half to one minute 
and check for presence of agglutination 

5 Controls with known red cells of 
group Aj and group A™ must be included

the expected positive and negative results 
are obtained with these controls 

fptTERPRETATiON Anti Ai serum or 
anti At lectin agglutinates only cells of 
group Aj or A,B Specimens that are not 
agglutinated are most commonly group A or 
A B The rare subgroup A^ or A3B can 
be recogmzed by the fact that on micro 
scopic examination only a few small agglu 
tinates are found surrounded by large 
numbers of nonagglutmated red cells even 
when potent anti A serums are tested with 
the unknown red cells Red cells of the 
rare subgroup A^ have the property of being 
agglutinated by most anLAB serums 
(serums of group 0 persons) while anti A 
serums are not capable of doing so

2 A modificauon of this test can be ustjd 
by the expenenced worker Instead of pre 
panng a 5 per cent suspension in their own 
serum of the unknomi red cells one may 
transfer with an applicator stick ("stick 
method ) a sufficient number of red cells 
mto the test tube containing the anti llh 
t>ping serum to make an approximatel> 5 
per cent suspension 

3 Agglutmations with anuRh serums 
are less solid and more easilj dispersed 
than those produced by anti A and anti B 
serums Hence the serum red cell mixtures 
should ne\er be shaken but should be 
gently tiMsted or rolled until the red cells 
are resuspended 

4 With each run of Rh typings controls 
must be included in which the same anti 
serum is tested with specimens of known 
Rh positive and Rh negative red cells

The procedure is identical with the pre 
ceding one except that a 2 per cent red 
cell suspension of the unknown specimen 
is prepared in saline One drop of this sus 
pension is added to I drop of the ana 
serum Incubation of the serum red cells 
nuxture for two hours at 37° C or incuba 
uon for 30 minutes followed bv centnfuga 
tion may be used 

Comments 1 In view of the bmited 
availability of saline anti Rh serums Iheir 
use should be restneted to special cases 
such as checking doubtful results obtained 
with antiserums containing incomplete 
antibodies 

2 Saline Rh anUserums should not be 
used for Rh typing of newborn infants with 
hemolytic disease of the newborn because 
of coating of red ccUs with Rh antibodies 
falsely negative results may be obtained in 
such specimens 

3 Specimens of patients with autoim 
mune hemolytic disease (sec p 313) may 
be difficult to type using incomplete Rli 
antibodies since suspension of red cells in 
any serum may bring about agglutination 
In this situation repeated washing of the 
red cells and use of the saline test is rcc 
ommended 

3 Slide test jor Rh typing 1 On a 
properly labeled glass slide place 1 drop 
of anti Rh serum containing Incomplete Rh 
antibody 

2 To the drop of antiserum add 2 drops 
of either whole blood (either directly ob- 
tained from skin puncture or oxalated or

atrated blood not older than 24 hours or 
a 50 per cent cell suspension prepared from

3 Mix serum and red cells and distnb- 
ute over a large area of the slide 

4 Place the sbde on a heated viewing 
box (Fig 5-4) bringmg the temperature of 
the mixture to 40 to 45° C 

5 Gently rock the slide back and forth 
and observe for agglutination 

6 Observe the test for two minutes un 
less agglutination occurs earlier 

7 At the end of the two minute penod 
record presence of agglutination with n 
"plus and absence of agglutination with 
a minus” sign 

Comments 1 Only Rh antiserums 
WTth incomplete antibodies (blocking al 
bumin agglutinin slide test serums) can 
be used 

2 Use of too dilute a red cell suspension 
or addition of too small an amount of red 
cell suspension to too much antisenim tr 
common sources of falsely negative results 

3 Another important cause of falsel 
negative tests Is inadequate wanning o 
the mixture The reaction may be spccdci 
up by preheating glass slides on the view

4 Falsely positive results may rcsul 
from autoagglutinauon or rouleaux forma

panied by a control prepared by adding 2 
drops of bovine albumin (20 to 30 per 
cent) to 2 drops of rod cell suspension used 
m the mam test This control is treated 
m the same way as the test itself 

iNTEnPRETATION AND COMMENTS I 
Agglutination observed m the mam test and 
absence of agglutination in the control in 
dicate the presence of the weakly reacting 
Rh (D*) factor 

2 If the control also shows positive re 
suits the test may be repeated in order to 
rule out a technical enor If the control 
continues to give positive results this sug 
gests coating of the red cells with auto 
antibody This can be confirmed by the 
direct antiglobulm (Coombs) test (cf 
method V, A) Determination of the D" lac 
tor in a patient with a positive direct anti 
globulin test is not possible 

3 Since there are a great many vanants 
of the D" factor differing from each other 
in reactivity it is not uncommon that the 
red cells of the same persons may be found 
at one time to react as D“ whereas sub 
sequently when different anti Rh serums 
are used they may be found as “regularly 
Rh (D)posiuve in tests using meth^ 
III 1 However as a rule negative results 
are obtained with such specimens when 
tested wall the sahne test tube method 

(m 2) 

4 In rare mstances D“ specimens pos 
sess such weak reactivity that even the 
test just desenbed fails to give a positive 
result In some of these mstances presence 
of D" can be demonstrated if the cells axe 
first treated with papain (cf p 288) and 
then subjected to incubauon with antiRh 
serum followed fa> the antiglobulm test 
as just desenbed 


IV Rh Subiyping In mstances to be dis 
cussed in connection with pretransfusion 
(cf p 301) and prenatal testing (cf p 
310), It is necessary to test for other Rh 
factors Tests for rh'(C) and rh (E) are 
usually done m persons negative for Rli 
(D) while Hr factois arc of interest m 
connection with tests for Rh genotymes 
(cf p 277) 

The techniques are identical wnth tests 
for Rh„(D) Test tube techniques are pre 
ferred and depending on the a\ ailabiiity of 
antiserums with complete or incomplete 
antibodies tests are earned out with cor 
responding techniques (III 1 or III 2) 

Antiserums are also available that con 
tarn antibodies for the three Rh factors 
Rhtt(D) rh (C) and rh (E) Such anti 
serums may be used parallel with anti 
Rh„(D) serum If positive resul s are ob 
tained with anti Kh " (anti CDE) serum 
and negative results with antiRb„(D) 
scrum this indicates the presence of rh (C) 
and/or rh"(E) Suitable tests using specific 
antirh'(C) and antirh'(E) serums decide 
the question On the other hand negative 
results rule out presence of both rh(C) 
and rh"(E) 

In subtypmg for Rh and Hr factors it 
IS essential to include known positive and 
negative controls m order to assure validity 
of the tests

agglutination of the test and the positive 
control and absence of agglutination m the 
negative control Although microscopic 
checking of doubtful results is rccom 
mended the presence of a feu small agglu 
tinates visible only microscopically should 
be regarded as a doubtful result In such 
cases the test should be repeated prefer 
ably with a different antiglobulin reagent 

2 Coating of red cells of groups A and 
B with the corresponding isoagglulimns 
anti A and an«B in newborn infants is 
often difficult to detect by means of the

results the test should be centrifuged im

7) as outlined for the direct antiglobulin 
(Coombs) test 

7 In order to assure validity of the test 
controls must be included in which cither 
red cells of known antigcmc composition 
or antibodies of known specificity arc used 
in parallel with the mam test 

Comments 1 The indirect anuglob- 
ulin (Coombs) technique cannot be used 
with red cells known to give a positive 
direct antiglobulin test 

2 The indirect antiglobulin technique 
is frequently used for determination of 
certain blood factors such as Duffy Kell 
and Kidd 

3 The indirect antiglobulin test may 
also be used for demonstration of anti 
bodies for these blood factors 

4 The mdirect antiglobulin test is one 
of the most reliable methods for cross- 
matching tests (cf p 296) 

5 A modification of the indirect anti 
globulin test with increased sensitivity in 
some instances is based on use of enzyme- 
treated red cells However this method 
cannot be used for demonstration of anti 
Duffy anti S and some other rarely en 
countered antibodies reacting with blood 
factors that arc destroyed by protcolvtic 
enzymes Caution also must be exerted 
concerning falsely positive results owing to 
the great sensitivity of the technique

The antlM and antiN typing strums 
commonly used are prepared by injecting 
rabbits with human red cells of type OM 
or ON and absorbing these immune scrum< 
with reciprocal red cells (N after injection 
of M cells M after injection of N cells) 
until agglutination specific for one of the 
two t)T)cs is obtained In using anti M and 
anti N typing scrums It Is important to

negatue persons More rarely antibodies for 
blood factors other than Rh (D) may be 
delected m Rh positive persons or anti 
bodies for some other blood factors in 
serum of Rh negative and Rh positive 
persons 

The following techniques deal mainly 
with tests for Rh antibodies Modifications 
necessary for detection and identification 
of antibodies other than anti Rh are dis 
cussed subsequently One of two general 
approaches may be utilized for screening 
for Rh antibodies (a) individual red cells 
of known Rh phenotyTics may be used m 
order to detect presence and determine 
specificity of Rh antibodies or (b) a pool 
of red cells prepared from two or three 
specimens possessing the commonly in 
volved Rh factors may be employed for 
screemng onlj If positive results are ob 
tamed with pooled red cells (b) the test 
is repeated with individual red cells (a) 
m order to provide information concerning 
specificity of the Rh antibodies Whenever 
pooled red cells are used it is important 
that at least 30 per cent of the red cells 
forming the pool contain each blood factor 
for which antibodies are sought 

Several methods may be employed in 
order to have available red cells of known 
antigenic composition whenev er needed 
Members of the blood bank staff laboratory, 
or hospital may be typed for such blood 
factors and blood obtained at appropriate 
times All such blood specimens should be 
of group O m order to eliminate any con 
fusing results resulting from isoagglutina 
non by anti A and anti B Blood donors 
readily available when needed maj be used 
in a similar fashion or blood specimens 
recently drawn may be tested for presence 
of the blood factors needed in order to 
select specimens with the desired antigenic 
composition Finally panels of red cell 
suspensions of known anUgenic composi 
tion arc available commercially with periods 
ol usefulness ranging from two to four 
weeks (cf p 280 for preservative solutions 
suitable for such purposes)

5 If agglutination occurs with Rh 
positive and Rh negative red cells the 
following possibilities must be considered 

a Autoagglutlmns tlus can be con 
firmed by fining a positive direct anti 
globulin test on the red cells of the blood 
speamen tested Furthermore the serum 
of the specimen tested with its own papain 
treated red cells will produce agglutination 
b Unsuitability of test cells This may 
be due to bacterial contamination coating 
with globulin or improper preserv anon

Cautions and Comments 1 Tlie 
papain treated red cells must not be incu 
bated for periods exceeding 30 minutes 
since falsely positi\e results may b ob- 
tamed after prolonged incubation 

2 Other enzymes such as trypsin 
ficm and bromelin may be used with 
similar results as papain The techniques 
recommended for their use must be ob- 
served closely 

Indirect antiejohuhn (Coombs) tech 
luqne (incUidtn^ test for complete or saline 
a^gtlltlnms) I Test cells of similar com 
position as those mentioned for the papain 
techmque are used 

// Technique 

1 Prepare 2 per cent red cell suspen 
sions in saline of the test cells 

2 For each serum specimen to be 
tested identify properly as many test tubes 
as test cells are to be used 

3 Into each test tube place 2 drops 
of the serum to be tested 

4 To each tube add 2 drops of the 2 
per cent suspension of the appropriate test 
cell suspension 

5 Incubate the red cell-scrum mix 
tures in a water bath at 37® C for two 
hours 

6 Checlv for agglutmauon with the 
naked eye and with the scanning lens and 
microscopically if in doubt 

7 If no agglubnation is observed pro- 
ceed with washing of red cell suspensions 
and addition of antiglobuUn serum as out 
lined in section V ( antiglobulm test 
p 285) 

Interpretation 1 If agglutination is 
observed in step 6 this indicates presence 
of complete (saline) Rh antibodies 

2 If agglutination is absent in step 
6 and occurs after completion of step 7 
this indicates presence of incomplete Rh 
antibodies 

3 Presence and absence of agglutina 
tion observed with different test cells is 
interpreted as outlined for papain technique 
(Tabic 5-12)

II Techmque 

1 Prepare a 2 per cent suspension of 
the test cells in bovine albumm 

2 For each serum specimen to be 
tested identify properly as many lest tubes 
as test cells are used 

3 Into each test tube place 2 drops 
of the serum to be tested 

4 To each test tube add 1 drop of the 
appropnate suspension of the test cells in 
bovine albumin and mix 

5 Without waiting centnfuge the red 
cell serum mixture for three minutes at 
1200 rp m 

6 Check for agglutination macro- 
scopically and with the scanmng lens 

7 If no agglutmauon is noted incu 
bate test tubes for one hour in a water bath 
of 37® C 

8 Centnfuge for one minute at 500 
rpm 

9 Gently resuspend the red cells and 
check for agglutmauon with the naked c^c 
and microscopically 

Interpretation and Comments 1 
The centnfugatjon in step 5 is intended 
to eliminate falsely negauve results caused 
by antibody excess which may be respon 
sible for a prozone phenomenon 

2 The following additional sets may 
also be included in the test (a) red cells 
of the unknown specimen suspended in 
their own serum (2 per cent) and treated 
in the same way as the other tubes (b) 
addition to 2 drops of the unknown serum 
of 1 drop of 2 per cent suspensions in saline 
of the test cells run parallel with the test 
lubes containing albumin suspended red 
cells Positive results with red cells of set 
(a) indicate presence of autoagglutinins 
Positive results obtained with saline sus 
pended red cells suggest the presence of 
complete (saline) Rh antibodies 

i Slide test (Diamond tlehon) 

I Reagents 

50 per cent suspension of 0 Rh posf 
live and O Rh negative test cells 

// Technique 

1 Place I drop eadi of the unknown 
serum on two glass slides one of which 
is identified as "Rh-*- " and the other av 
"Rh- " 

2 To the first slide add 2 drops of the 



Blood Groups and Their Application 


SO per cent suspension of O Rh positive 
blood to the second slide add 2 drops of 
the 50 per cent suspension of the O Rh 
negative blood 

3 On each sbde mix the serum wth 
the cell suspension and spread over large 
area 

4 Place the slides on a heated viewing 
box (cf Fig 5-4 p 284) 

5 Gently rock the slides back and 
forth and observe up to three minutes un 
less agglutination occurs earlier 

Interpretation Agglutination of the 
Rb positive red cells and absence of agglu 
tination of Rh negative red cells indicates 
the presence of Rh antibodies NOTE The 
sensitivity of the techniques 1 to 4 for 
detection of Rh antibodies decreases in this

II Techniques Whenever the pres 
ence of an irregular antibody is suspected 
in a serum it should be tested with ap- 
propriate red cell suspensions usmg the 
following three techniques saline sus 
pended red cells indirect aiiciglabuiin tech 
nique and papain treated red cells Although 
the first pan of the indirect antiglobulm 
test also permits evaluation of the presence 
of complete antibodies reacting wth *alme 
suspended red cells at 37“ C it is also 
advisable to test for the presence of com 
plete antibodies reactive at lower temper 
atures specifically at 20 to 2S“ C (room 
temperature) and at 4 to 6® C (ice box 
temperature) A single set using sahne 
suspended red cells may be first incubated 
and read at room temperature and then 
transferred to the ice box preferably over 
night The general procedures for antibody 
screemng ate those outlmed before In some 
instances it also may be advisable to use 
bovine albumin suspended test cells in a 
procedure analogous to the Hattersley test 
(VII 3) 

Interpretation 1 Exclusion of anti 
body specificity Presence of antibodies is 
conclusively ruled out for those blood fac 
tors that are represented by test cells not 
agglutinated by the unknown «?crum under 
the various testing conditions For example 
if test cells containing the K) 


291 

are not agglutinated this is evidence for 
absence of anti K antibody in the serum 
under study 

2 Tentative identification of antibody 
specificity This is facilital-d by finding a 
“common denominator*' m test cells that 
were agglutinated by the serum tested 
eg if all test cells agglutinated contain 
the Duffy factor (Fy*) this is presumptive 
evidence for presence of anti Fy* m the 
serum tested 

3 Definitive identification of antibody 
specificity After a tentative idenufication 
of the antibody specificity has been made 
a definitive identification should be at 
tempted by the following methods 

a TTie serum is tested with a mini 
mum of SIX separate red cell specimens 
three of which contain the antigen in 
question and three of which do not contain 
It (e g if tentative identification of anti 
Kell antibody is made test the serum with 
three Kell positive and three Kell negative 
red cell specimens) If agglutination is ob 
tamed with all red cell specimens contam 
mg the incriminated antigen and no agglu 
tination is obtained with red cell sped 
mens free of this antigen the tentative 
antibody identification has been confirmed 
b The serum is absorbed with red 
cell suspension containing the incriminated 
antigen (red cell suspension #1) and with 
red cell suspension free of this antigen (red 
cell suspension #2) 

Using the same red cell suspension as 
used for absorption (#1) parallel titrations 
are set up with 

1 the unabsorbed serum 
JJ the serum after absorption with 
red cell suspension #1 
III the serum after absorption with 
red cell suspension ti2 
If titrations 1 and III yield results differ 
ing only slightly from each other and if 
titration II yields significantly lower values 
or even disclosed disappearance of the anti 
body this corroborates the tentative Idenii 
fication of the antibody 

c If at all possible the complete blood 
formula of the red cells of the person with 
the antibody should be determined With 
rare excepuons the antigen for which the 
antibody is specific should be found absent 
in the red cells of the sensitized person 
eg a person with anti rh (E) antibodv 
in the serum has red cells that are negative 
forrh (E)

common pitfalls in attempts to identify

Clinical Diagnosis b\ Lsborator^ ^^ETHOIls 


irregular hemoantibodles is caused by the 
presence of nonspecific agglutinins which 
clump red cell specimens indiscriminately 
The best method of detecting such anti 
bodies IS to include in each test the red 
cells of the same person whose serum is 
tested AggluUnation found in this sus 
pension suggests the presence of nonspecific 
agglutinins (complete or incomplete cold 
agglutinins or warm autoagglutinins) In 
some of these cases the presence of auto 
antibodies may be confirmed by finding 
a positive direct antiglobuhn test with the 
red cells of the specimen tested 

2 Cell controls In order to be sure 
that test cells have not undergone some 
changes making them agglutmable in a 
nonspecific fashion always include controls 
consisting of 2 drops of sahne and 2 drops 
of the corresponding red cell suspension 
Agglutination found in any of these cell 
controls invahdates results obtained in the 
mam test 

3 Helpful information on probable 
identity of the antibody may be derived 
from Its behavior at different temperatures 
and m different techmques 

a Anti P anti M and anti N most 
commonly react better or only at low 
temperatures and with saline suspended 
red cells 

b Anil Fy® antibodies as a rule react 
only with the indirect annglobuUn tech 
nique and give negative results with papain 
treated red cells 

c MN factors are destroyed by pro 
teolytic enzymes and cannot be detected 
with this technique 

d Rh Hr antibodies react best with 
papain treated red cells and when present 
in low titer may give positive results only 
with this technique 

e Antibodies resulting from isosensi 
tization by blood transfusions or pregnancy 
are as a rule incomplete antibodies and give 
best results with papain and antiglobuhn 
techniques natural antibodies for which 
the cause of sensitization is not known 
react best with saline suspended red cells 
f Some antibodies give much stronger 
reactions with red cells homozygous for the 
respective factor while red cells heterozy 
gous for the factor are agglutmatcd either 
weakly or not at all ( double dose effects”) 
e g antiM may aggluunate MM cells much 
more strongly than MN cells 

4 More than one antibody may be 
present This possibility is suggested when 
in the course of the tentative antibody 
identification two or more test cell speci 


mens agglutinated by the serum tested are 
found not to contam a common antigen 
Definitive identification of multiple anti 
bodies requires absorption tests 

5 Red cell suspensions should not be 
used for longer than 12 hours after prep 
aiatton even if stored at 4° C 

VIII Titration of Antibodies Serial di 
lutions of the serum to be tested are pre 
pared To each senal dilution add the test 
cells containing the blood factor(s) react 
mg with the antibodies tested After com 
pletion of the test agglutinations are ob 
served and recorded The highest dilution 
of the serum showing agglutination is the 
reciprocal of the antibody titer eg if 
agglutination is observed in the serum dilu 
tion of 1 32 but agglutination is absent m 
the serum dilution of 1 64 the titer is 
recorded as 32 The followmg techniques 
refer to titration of Rb antibodies \\ ith 
suitable modification of the nature of test 
cells these techniques can be apphed to 
titration of other isoamibodies

5 In separate dilution tubes an equal 
number of drops of the 1 2 serum dilution 
and physiologic saline are mixed resulting 
m a dilution of 1 4 Such dilutions are con 
tinued until the dilution of 1 512 is reached 

6 Into the second tube of each row 
place 2 drops of serum dilution 1 2 into 
the third tube place 2 drops of serum dilu 
Uon 1 4 and so on 

7 To each tube add 1 drop of the 2 
per cent suspension of the appropriate test 
cells

incubate in a water bath of 37° C for 
two hours

Alternative procedure to steps 4 to 6 
If onI> one test cel! suspension is used one 
may proceed as follows a Into all but the 
first of the ten tubes place 2 drops of saline 
b To the second tube add 2 drops of the 
scrum tested and after mixing the contents 
transfer 2 drops to the third test tube Con 
tmue with this procedure until the tenth 
test tube from which after mixing of con 
tents 2 drops are removed and discarded 
Thus again a twofold serial dilution up to 
1 512 has been prepared If a high antibody 
titer is expected one may prepare a primary 
serum dilution of I 5 or 1 10 and then pro- 
ceed wiUi twofold sen'll dilutions le 15

is diluted with serum of a person of group 
AB instead of with physiologic saUne The

The technique gi\en next may be suitably 
modified if a different cntical titer is 
chosen 

Technique 

1 Into a large test tube place 9 9 ml 
of physiologic saline 

2 To the test tube add 0 1 ml of the 
serum to be tested wth an accurately cal 
ibrated serologic pipet 

3 Mix carefully by expelling the con 
tents of the pipet into the saline, drawing 
up fluid, and expeUing it se\eral times 
Stopper and mix by imerting the tube 
This produces a dilution of 1 100 

4 Identify one of two tubes as “A“ 
and the other as 

5 Add 0 1 ml of the diluted serum 
to each of the two lubes 

6 To the tube marked “A" add 0 1 ml 
of a 2 per cent suspension of red cells of 
group A and to the tube marked “B add 
0 1 ml of a 2 per cent suspension of red 
cells of group B 

7 Let stand at room temperature for 
IS minutes and centrifuge for one minute 

8 Check for presence of agglutination 
>vith the naked eye and if in doubt or if 
result IS negame to the naked eye, micro 
scopically after placing a drop of the serum 
cell mixture on a slide 

Interpretation If the diluted serum 
agglutinated A or B cells the titer of anu A 
or anti B exceeds 100 such blood is desig 
nated as "Tiigh utered” and is eliminated 
from use as “umi.ersal donor ” If the diluted 
serum did not agglutinate A or B red cells 
U is designated as ^ow titered " and the 
blood may be selected for potential use as 
“uniiersal donor” 

NOTE 1 Specific tests are required be- 
fore low titered blood of group O can be 
safely gi%en as universal donor (cf section 
X Crossmatch Techniques Minor Cross 
match for Universal Donor and Recipient) 

2 If the presence of hemolysin for A 
or B cells has been noted in the ABO 
grouping (cf II 1 p 281) such blood 
should be designated as “high titered" (even 
if the saline dilution of 1 100 failed to 
agglutinate A or B cells) and be excluded 
from use as universal donor 

3 If the titer exceeded 100 for one blood 
group but not for the other such blood may 
be considered for use as universal donor 
for a recipient of the blood group for which 
the liter did not exceed 100 

n Deicclioii nntl titration of wcom- 
plete tion^"lutniins The following tech 
niques represent attempts to distinguish 
between complete (“natural") and incom- 


plete (“immune”) anti A and anti B iso- 
agglutinins, as a rule the latter result from 
specific antigemc stimulations, such as ad- 
ministration of incompatible blood, preg 
nancy of a woman with a fetus of an in 
compatible ABO group or administration of 
antigens widely distributed in nature and 
chemically related to A and B group specific 
substance Since the properties difi'erenti 
ating complete and incomplete anti-A and 
anti B cannot be demonstrated regularly, it 
IS advisable to test more than one method 
in each instance 

The following differences are most 
readily established ( 1 ) thermal range 
complete isoagglutlmns show higher titers 
at 4® C than at 37“ C , while the converse 
IS true frequently for incomplete isoagglu 
tinins, (2) incomplete isoagglutinins yield 
higher liters with papam treated red cells 
than with saline suspended untreated red 
cells, while this is not true for complete 
isoagglutinins, and (3) in the presence of 
group specific substance A and B incom 
pleie isoaggluunins may aggluunate red 
cells susjx;nded in macromolecular medium 
The same may be accompbshed with the 
indirect antiglobulin (Coombs) technique 
This is not the case with complete isoag 
glutimns

Blood Groups and 

Uons of the serum to be tested if it is of 
group O If the serum is from a person of 
group A or B only one such set is needed 
If on the other hand one deals with the 
serum of a pregnant woman and the red 
cells of her husband are available a third 
or second set respectively is prepared for 
testing with his red cells In the case of 
possible transfusion sensitization the red 
cells of the donor should also be used 

2 To each tube of one of these sets 
add 1 drop of the 2 per cent suspension 
of A cells to each tube of the other set 
add 1 drop each of the 2 per cent suspen 
Sion of B cells To tubes of the third set if 
present add 1 drop each of the 2 per cent 
suspension of the husbands or donors 
red cells 

3 Incubate in a vvater bath of 37® C 
for two hours 

4 Read and record agglutinations 

5 Resuspend the red cell suspensions 
and transfer into an ice box preferably for 
incubation overnight 

6 Read and record agglutinations 
present after xce box incubation 

Interpretation Titers significantly 
higher (more than one dilution tube) after 
incubation at 37® C than after ice box 
incubation speak m favor of presence of 
incomplete isoagglucmins 

2 Test -urtth Papain treated Red Cells 

1 Simultaneously with preceding test 
prepare additional sets of twofold serial 
dilutions in saline of the serum to be tested 
for use with papain treated red cells of 
groups A, and B and of the husband 
if available 

2 Incubate mixtures of serum diiu 
tions and papain treated red cells for 30 
minutes in a water bath of 37° C 

3 Read and record presence of agglu 
tination 

Interpretation Significantly higher 
titers obtained with papain treated red cells 
as compared with those of saline suspended 
red cells speak in favor of presence of in 
complete isoagglutimns 

3 Neutralization Techmtjue 

1 Mix equal parts of the serum and 
of group specific substances A and B 

2 For each test cell suspension (Ai 
B husbands red cells) to be used prepare 
two sets of twofold serial dilutions of the 
mixture of the serum with group specific 
substance using physiologic saline as dilu 
cm for one set and scrum of group AB 
for the other 


Their Application 

3 To each tube of the saline dilution 
senes add one drop of the corresponding 2 
per cent red cell suspension in saline 
(group Aj group B husbands red cells) 

4 To each of the test tubes of the 
serum dilutions prepared with group AR 
serum add one drop of the corresponding 
albumin suspended red cells 

5 Incubate all titrations for two hours 
at room temperature 

6 Read and record the results 

Interpretation As a rule neutraliza 

tion with group specific substance reduces 
or completely inhibits the isoagglutlnation 
of saline suspended red cells On the other 
hand in the presence of incomplete anti A 
and anti B testing of the neutralized mix 
ture with albumm suspended red cells 
shows unchanged strength of agglutination 
Thus absence of agglutination with saline 
suspended red cells and presence of agglu 
Mnation with albumin suspended red cells 
exposed to serum mixed wath group specific 
substance speaks m favor of the presence 
of incomplete isoagglutmin 

NOTE (1) If, after mixing equal pans 
of serum and group'Specific substance 
neutralization is incomplete the proportion 
of group specific substance should be in 
creased eg b> adding four volumes of 
group-specific substance to one volume of 
serum The subsequent procedures are 
analogous to those described 

(2) The presence of incomplete Iso 
agglutimns in “neutralized scrum mi> be 
also demonstrated by means of the indirect 
antiglobulm test serial dilutions of the 
neutralized serum are incubated with saline 
suspended red cells in a water bath of 
37° C for two hours and checked for agghi 
tination Dilution tubes not showing agglu 
Unation are converted into the indirect anti 
globulin test If the Indirect antiglobulin 
test produces a significant increase of tiler 
as compared with the first reading this 
speaks in favor of presence of incomplete 
isoagglutimns

Procedure 

1 Into each of six properlj identified 
test tubes place 2 drops of the serum to be 
tested 

2 To the first tube add 2 drops of 
saUne suspended red cells of group A, to 
the second 2 drops of sahn suspended red 
cells of group B and to the third 2 drops 
of saline suspended red cells of group O 

3 To the fourth fifth and sixth test 
tubes add 2 drops each of papain treated 
red cells of groups A B and O respectnely 

4 Incubate the mixtures of serum and 
saline suspended red cells in a water bath 
of 37 C for two hours and check for 
presence of agglutination 

5 Test tubes not showing agglutma 
tion are converted into the indirect anti 
globulm test and checked again for agglu 
tination 

6 Test tubes ivith thf* serum and 
papain treated red cells are incubated for 
30 minutes in a water bath of 37* C 

7 The tubes are centrifuged for one 
half minute and checked for agglutination 

Interpretation 1 Presence of agglu 
tination with saline suspended red cells 
(step 4) before the indirect antiglobulin 
test indicates presence of complete agglu 
tmins 

2 Absence of agglutination before and 
presence of agglutination after the anti 
globulin test as well as agglutination of 
papain treated red cells indicates presence 
of incomplete agglutinms 

3 Presence of incompatible agglutmin

hemolytic disease of the new born caused by 
maternal isosensiUzation to A or B factors 

NOTE Use of both antig-obulin and 
papain techmques is recommended since 
in some instances only one of them may 
yield posime results If so desired titration 
of the isoagglutimns may be performed 
Cells of group O sene as control for pres 
ence of isoantibodies other than anti A and 
anti B 

\ Crossmatdung Tests After blood has 
been selected for transfusion accordmg to 
the principles detailed in a subsequent sec 
non (cf p 300) suitable tests i« vitro — 
crossmatching tests — must be performed 
in each instance m order to insure absence 
of incompatibility between the blood to be 
transfused and the blood of the prospective 
recipient Most importantly one must make 
sure m the major crossviatch that the 
serum of the recipient does not contam 
isoantibodies capable of reacting with the 


transfused red cells Of secondary though 
sometimes considerable importance is ab 
sence in the “minor crossmatch in the 
transfused plasma of isoagglutimns capable 
of reactmg with the recipients red cells 
It IS essentnl that the tests be capable of 
detectmg both complete and incomplete 
antibodies

NIQUE 

1 Prepare a 2 per cent suspension m 
salme of the red cells of the prospective 
donor 

2 Separate the serum of the recipient 
from a specimen of clotted blood obtained 
within 24 hours 

3 Into a properly identified test tube 
place 2 drops of recipient s serum 

4 Add to the tube 2 drops of the 2 per 
cent suspension of the donors red cells 

5 Centrifuge immediately for one mm

6 Check for presence of agglutination 

7 If no agglutmation is present place 
in a water bath of 37* C and incubate for 
15 minutes 

8 Wash the red cells three times with 
tubefuls of saline following the procedures 
outhned for the antiglobulin techmque (cf 

p 286) 

9 After the last washing discard the 
supernatant and resuspend the red cells m

3 Centrifuge for 30 seconds and 
check for agglutination macroacopically

Interpretation Presence of agglu

This test is more sensitive than the indirect 
antiglobuhn technique for detection of 
trace amounts of Rhllr antibodies It may 
be converted into the Indirect antiglobuhn 
technique after the incubation period thus 
detecting antt Kell and some but not all 
ana Dulf> antibodies 

It Winor crosinm(ch lest Proceed in 
the same a\a> as outlined for the major 
crossnntch but use scrum of the donor and

NOTE In man> laboriiones the minor 
crossmaich is only performed tlirougb step 
6 of the indirect antiglobuhn (Coombs) 
technique In this onl> complete agglu 
tinins may be detected and it is therefore 
important to prescreen serums of donors 
for presence of Incomplete antibodies es 
pccially Rh antibodies in Rh negative 
donors 

III Croji/Mlrh for selection of inn 
terstil iloitors anil transfiisiou of inmenal 
refipicntj The blood to be selected should 
not have anti A or anti B hcmDl>sin (cf 
II 1) and should have an anti A or aniiB 
titer of less than 100 (cf IX A p 293) 
Nevertheless the minor crossmatch in such 
instances ma) always be expected to pro 
duce agglutination since the serum of the 
donor contains an isoaggUitinin reactive 
With die red cells of the lecipient The 
following technique (Grove Rasmussen) is 
recommended for the minor crossmatch in 
order to avoid transfusion of potentially 
dangerous isoigglutmins 

1 To 0 1 ml of the donor s serum add 
0 3 ml of solution of group specific sub 
stances A and B 

2 Incubate the mixture at room tempera 
ture for five mmuies 

3 To 0 1 ml of this mixture add 0 1 ml 
of a 2 per cent suspension in saline of 
the recipients red cells 

4 Shake the tube and incubate for 15 
minutes in a water bath of 37“ C 


297 

5 Convert into an indirect antiglobuhn 
(Coombs) test 

INTERPRETVTION If agglutination is 
observed at the end of the test it is not 
safe to transfuse the recipient with the 
blood selected 

NOTE The modified mmor crossmatch 
test and these considerations are not 
required if packed or resuspended red cells 
are to be transfused that is wathout 
the supernatant plasma The test cannot 
be applied vvhen the red cells of the re 
cipient show a positive direct antiglobuhn 
(Coombs) test 

\I MisccHancous Tests Several labora 
tor> tests utilize hemagglutination though 
the) are not rehted to any of the specific 
blood factors described m the preceding 
sections the> may employ human red cells 
or red cells of a different species (hetero 
agglutinins) One imporfuit category is 
represented by 'tuloaggluiimns i e anu 
bodies capable of agglutmatmg the red cells 
of the same person from whom the serum 
is derived They may be active either as 
cold or "warm antibodies and be de 
tectable by methods described for either 
complete or incomplete antibodies ITiese 
autoagglutmins are of particular importance 
in connection with the diagnosis of auto 
immune hemol>t)c anemia Cold auto 
agglutmins usually referred to as cold 
agglutinins form the basis of ancillary 
tests m diagnosis of vixal (atypical) pneu 
monia (cf p 174) 

Heteroaggluamns for sheep red ceDs 
have been found to be increased m certain 
conditions such as infectious mononucle 
osis serum disease and miscellaneous in 
fections Demonstration of increased titer 
and changes in absorption properties of 
sheep agglutmins is a part of the diagnos 
tic test for mfeciious mononucleosis as 
outlined in derail in another context (cf 
p 217ff ) 

Increased titers of agglutinin for sheep 
red cells previouslj sensitued with sub- 
threshold amoxmts of antisheep hemolysin 
have been observed xn serums of patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA factor) 
As shown in subsequent work other tech 
niques can be used to detect this serum 
factor (cf p 891fF )

fants, reaching their full development with 
the age of approximately one year Recent 
evidence has also been presented that such 
diseases as leukemia and cancer may in 
exceedmgly rare cases change the reactivity 
of A and B factors Reference to weakly 
reacting Rh factors has been made pre 
viously An important extraneous factor 
lowermg the reactivity of blood factors is 
the age of the blood specimen especially 
if kept in a sabne suspension and if not 
preserved at ice box temperature Blood 
collected with an anticoagulant as a rule 
does not retain its full reactivity for more 
than one to two days Clotted blood spcci 
mens properly preserved are full> reactive 
for at least five days and the mimmum 
reactivity needed for crossmatch tests Is 
preserved for three weeks Collection of 
blood in ACD solution has been found to 
provide better preservation of agglutinabil 
It} of blood factors than is the case in 
clotted blood 

2 Faulty Concentration of Red 
Cell Suspensions Too high a concentra 
tion ma} lead to an antigen excess pre 
venting umon of the isoantibody with 
blood factors On the other hand too dilute 
a red cell suspension may interfere with ob- 
servation of weak agglutmations 

3 Faulty Proportion Between 
Antibody and Red Cell Suspension 
False negative reactions representing pro- 
zone phenomena ma) result from an ex 
cess of antibody in proportion to the amount 
of antigen present (i e quantity of red 
cells) Such “zoning” is especially common 
in undiluted serum with high titer of in 
complete Rh antibodies 

4 Inadeouate Antibody Titer in 
Serum This is especiall} important in con 
nection with blood grouping serums such 
as anti A anUB and antiRh«(D) for 
which T ninim iim titers have been estab 
lished by the Division of Biologies Stand 
ards of the National Institutes of Health 
Cef p 280) This assures the rehabihty of 
tests done with commercially distnbuted 
grouping serums On the oth“r hand search 
for antibodies in unknown serums may 
give fabely negative results if the titer is 
below a certam threshold especially if com 
famed with a poorly reacting blood factor 
m the red cells used Contrary to testing 
serums the titers of antibodies in unknown 
serums are not subject to control This 
makes it mandatory to use m such tests 
the most reactive form of red cell antigen 
available 


5 Presence of Hemolysin in Se 
PUM Tested Since no agglutination for the 
specific blood factor tested may occur as a 
result of hemolysis this may be erroneousl} 
interpreted as a negative result Suspicion 
however should be raised by the absence 
or paucity of detectable red cells Inactiva 
tion of such serum (30 minutes m water 
bath of 56® C ) destroys hemolytic reacth 
ity of the anubody so that agglutmauon 
can be observed in a test repeated with the 
inactivated specimen 

6 Deviation from Optimal Tem 
perature Since some hemoantibodies re 
act best at Ice box and others at body 
temperature, it is important to observe such 
optimal temperatures m testing of low 
titered antibodies m order not to miss 
weakly positive results 

7 Inadequate periods of Incuba 
tion Tlie lower the titer of the antibody 
and the poorer the reactivity of the blood 
factor(aggluunogen) thelongerraust bethe 
periods of incubauon in order to produce v is 
ible agglutination Centrifugation and other 
forms of mechanical agitation may be used 
in order to shorten periods of mcubation 

li False posttwe results 

1 Presence in the Sebum of Un 
suspected Agglutinins This may occur 
with typing serums as well as with un 
known specimens to be screened for pres 
ence of certain antibodies Interfering anti 
bodies most commonly encountered are 
cold agglutinins warm autoagglutinins 
and irregular agglutinins of 'pecific nature 
such as anti P and anti Rh Careful pre 
screening of groupmg serums is a critical 
procedure In the case of unknown serums 
suitable red cell controls must be included 
m order to detect presence of unexpected 
agglutinms

agglutination This is a reflection of the 
same phenomenon that is responsible for 
sedimentation of red cells m which the red 
cells adhere to each other presentmg a 

stack of coins” appearance Rouleaux for 
mation is favored b} the presence in serum 
of increased amounts of as}imnetnc pro- 
tein molecules such as fibrinogen and ^ob- 
ulm and by large surfaces such as occurs 
in slide tests Extreme rouleaux is com 
monly assoaated with certain diseases pro- 
ducing hyperprotememia and hyperglobu 
Imemia such as multiple myeloma kala 
azar Boeck s sarcoid and cr}Oglobiilinemia 
The gross appearance of rouleaux may 
sometimes be difficult to differentiate from 



Blood Groups and 

true agglutination, but as a rule the tnie 
nature of the phenomenon can be readily 
distinguished microscopically (cf. Fig. 5-5). 
In rouleaux formation individual red cells 
can be seen to separate readily from each 
other after mechanical agitation, such as 
tapping on the slide, whereas this does not 
occur in true agglutinates. Actually mechan- 
ical agitation favors true agglutination. Fur- 
thermore red cell agglutinates exhibit defor- 
mation and discoloration of the red cells, 
ivhile red cells in rouleaux retain the normal 
appearance. Dilution of serum with saline 
in^bits rouleaux formation, whereas true 
agglutination is not affected unless the 
titer is at a critically low lev'el. 

3. Bacterial Contamination. Cer- 
tain microorganisms, such as Vibrio cliol- 
erae, “activate” receptors present in all red 
ceils, designated as “T agglutinogen," which 
react ivith the T agglutinin present in all 
serums except that of newborn infants. 
Such agglutination is independent of the 
presence or absence of any other blood 
factors (Hiibener-Thomsen phenomenon). 
Bacterial contamination of the serum may 
impart to it the capacity to clump all red 
cells independent of presence or absence 
of any blood factors (Davidsohn and 
Toharsky, 1940, 1942). It is obwous there- 
fore that all precautions of asepsis must be

taken in handling specimens and reagents 
used for hemagglutination. 

In addition to technical errors experience 
has shotvn that the most serious mistakes 
in hemagglutination work, especially those 
related to blood transfusions, are the results 
of cardessness or human faJlibility. This in- 
cludes failures to establish proper identity 
of blood specimens, donors, and patients, 
mix-up of specimens after collection; as 
well as excessive haste in performance of 
tests. Although emergencies arise especially 
frequently in connection ^vith blood trans- 
fusions, this must never be an excuse for 
short cuts, which jeopardize the reliabihty 
of tests. Probably in no other area of lab- 
oratory tvork does a greater responsibdity 
rest with the technologist and other mem- 
bers of the staff concerning adequate per- 
formance of tests. Errors resulting from 
such work are not subject to any review or 
medical judgment by the physician by con- 
trast with the situation applying to other 
laboratory tests. It is well known that even 
fatal reactions may follow administration 
of incompatible blood. Hence proper organi- 
zation of the work, adequate education, and 
constant alertness of the staff entrusted 
tvith such duties are imperative. 

Practical Applications of 
Hemagglutination Tests 

r. Blood Transfusion. The numerous 
clinical considerations pertaining to hemo- 
therapy cannot be discussed within the 
framework of this chapter. For information 
on this subject the reader is referred to 
monographs by Mollison (1962); Wiener 
(1948); De Gowin, Hardin, and Alscver 
(1949); and the "Technical Methods and 
Procedures" published by the American 
Association of Blood Banks (1960). The 
main purpose of the following outline is to 
discuss laboratory tests needed for the 
proper collection, processing, and selection 
of blood for transfusions. 

7. Prescreening of potential blood 
donors. The two main considerations in 
accepting potential blood donors are pro- 
tection of the donor against any possible 
JH effects from the loss of blood and pro- 
tection of the prospective recipient against 
any untoward effects itom the transfusion. 
The first consideration necessitates that 
donors can be accepted only if they fulfill 
certain minimum requirements as to age. 
height, weight, and hemoglobin. In the 
most commonly employed screening test 
for hemoglobin, a drop of blood is permitted 



300 


Climcxl Divcnosis b\ Ladorvtor\ Mitiiods 


to fall into a solution of copper sulfate of 
known specific gravity If the drop of blood 
descends to the bottom of the solution 
rather than floating or rising to the surface 
the specific gravity of the blood is greater 
than that of the copper sulfate solution 
(see p 77) According to general practice 
male donors should have a minimal hemo 
globin concentration of 13 5 gm per 100 
ml that IS the drop of blood should have 
a specific gravity greater than a copper sul 
fate solution with specific gravity 1 055 
while for female donors a minimal hemo 
gJobin concentration of 12 5 gm per 100 
ml is required corresponding to a specific 
gravity exceeding that of a copper sulfate 
solution with specific gravity 1 053 For his 
own protection a donor should not give 
blooJ more frequently than intervals of 
eight to ten weeks and not more often than 
five time*- a year The second considera 
tion — protection of the recipient — requires 
the donor to be free of any infectious or 
contagious disease including tuberculosis 
rheumatic fever and syphilis and tempera 
ture pulse and blood pressure should be 
within the normal range Donors who have 
had malaria or viral (infectious) hepatitis 
should never be accepted 

An adequate record of prescreening tests 
and answers to pertinent questions ob 
tamed from the prospective donor should be 
prepared and retained Proper methods of 
identification of the donor and his record 
arc of utmost importance prior to the col 
lection of blood 

2 CoUectinti of bland Although i \a 
riety of containers (glass plastc) and 
methods (gravity vacuum) can be em 
ployed for collection of blood and tech 
meal skill is important the following pre 
cautions are most important (a) climlna 
non of any mistake in identity of donor and 
container assured by proper identification 
of the blood container and pilot tubes col 
Icctcd simultaneous!) (b) aseptic han 
dlmg of the collection and the container In 
order to avoid bicternl contamination (c) 
use of proper anticoagulant and preserva 
live solutions (d) immediate refrigeration 
of the blood after collection (c) storage 
of the blood in refrigeration equipment 
maintaining a temperature range of 4 to 
6° C 

5 /’roretimg of I land The following 
tests arc mandatory before blood can be 
released for transfusional use (1) ABO 
grouping (p 280) (2) R!i (D) typing (p 
283) (3) tests for presence of D (p 284) 
rh (C) and rh (E) (p 285) when blood 


has been found to be Rh (D) negative (4) 
serologic test for syphilis (p 83911) Addi 
tional desirable tests are screening of iso 
agglutmin titer m serum of group O blood 
(p 293) screening for irregular antibodies 
of all serums particularly for Rh antibodies 
in serums of Rh (D) negative donors (p 
287) and identification of irrep.ilar inti 
bodies when present (p 291) 

Only in special circumstances such as 
unexplained difficulties in crossmatchmg or 
investigation of transfusion reactions (p 
303) IS It necessary to carry out Rh sub 
typing (p 2S3) of Rh (D) positive blood 
or tests for subgroups of A m A and AB 
blood 

An optional procedure employed in some 
blood bank laboratones is performance of 
the thymol turbidity test in an attempt to 
detect donors with abnormal liver function 
suggestive of a possible earner state of viral 
hepatitis Although some workers have pre 
sented evidence that use of this test lowers 
the incidence of homologous scrum jaun 
dice resulimg from blood transfusions 
others have failed to confirm this imprcs 
sion In general it must be emphasized 
that at present no laboratory test available 
IS capable of detecting or ruling out with 
certainty the presence of the hepatitis virus 
m blood 

At least once a day and again before is 
suance all units of blood should be in 
spected in order to detect any abnormal 
appearance such as discoloration hemoly 
sis and cloudiness that mav be an indica 
tion of faulty preservation or bacterial con 
lamination It is good practice to run bac 
tcnal cultures (see p 835) periodically on 
units of blood that have not been issued 
before the three week period of useful shelf 
life has ended or that have to be discarded 
for other reasons such as positive sero 
logic tests for syphilis Results of such cul 
turcs provide information on the sterility 
of the collecting equipment and proper 
asepsis in handling and storage of blood 
/ Selrcliou of I hod Adequate selec 
tion of blood requires close and intelligent 
cooperation between clinicians and blood 
bank staff With rare exceptions as ex 
plained later on adequate pretransfusion 
tests are required for proper selection of 
blood Clotted blood (quantities of 5 to 10 
ml are desirable) should be obtained from 
the prospective recipient within 24 hours 
before anticipated administration of blood 
and should be subjected to ABO grouping 
(p 280) and Rh (D) typing (p 283) In 
the case of infants or debilitated paticnis 



Blood Groups and 

presenting difficulties for ^empuncture, 
blood may be obtained by sUn punctures m 
capillary tubes, which are centrifuged in 
order to yield red cell suspensions and 
serum for the crossmatch tests 

The primary consideration in selection 
of blood is to provide a unit of the same 
ABO group as that of the recipient Further- 
more Rh„(D) positive recipients should re- 
cei\e Rh (D) positive blood, whereas for 
Rh,(D) negative recipients blood of type rh 
(ede) should be used, that is, blood not 
only lacking Rhu(D) but also rh'(C) and 
rh"(E) Such blood should also have been 
proved by smtable tests not to possess a 
weak Rh„ variant (D") The pilot tube of a 
unit satisfying these criteria is then utilized 
for crossmatching tests as outlined previ- 
ously (p 296) Evidence of compatibility 
in major and minor crossmatch tests must 
be established before release of blood for 
transfusion 

Although not mandatory, it is desirable to 
screen the serum of the recipient for the 
presence of irregular antibodies concom 
itontly with or prior to crossmatching, since 
this may disclose irregular antibodies, in 
eluding autoantibodies and cold aggluti- 
nins If unexpected incompatibility Is en- 
countered in crossmatching tests, all pos- 
sible sources of error should be investigated 
preferably by repeating the test with a new 
specimen oi the recipient and using other 
donor pilot tubes of suitable ABO and Rh 
type Cold agglutinins arc a common source 
of imexpected incompatibility and their 
presence can be confirmed as outlined on 
p 890fF Selection of blood for patients with 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia often poses 
difficult problems, since complete com- 
patibility can rarely be obtained Testing 
with numerous units possibly b> using 
serial dilutions of the patient’s serum, may 
disclose some blood specimens that arc 
less incompatible and hence presumably 
more suitable for transfusion The clinicnn 
should be adnsed of the findings In such 
cases before blood is released for trans- 
fusion All specimens of pilot tubes of the 
units and of recipients used for crossmalch 
mg should be presen cd under refrigeration 
for at least five davs after administration 
of the transfusion, since tlicse specimens 
are indispensible for proper investigation of 
transfusion reactions if such occur (p 
303) 

New specimens for crossmatching tests 
must be obtained from the recipient and 
used for selection of blood whenever more 
than 24 hours have elapsed since a previ 


Tiicir Applicaiion !101 

ous transfusion In other words it would be 
a serious error to use a blooj specimen ob 
tamed prior to a transfusion given two or 
three days before nnd to use it to select 
blood for a new transfusion, because sub 
threshold levels of irregular antibodies 
may have been present in the earlier spcci 
men and may have escaped detection Tlic 
intervening transfusion then could hive 
stimulated a rapid nse of such antibodies 
that could produce gross mcompatibiluj 
with subsequently given blood thus leading 
to serious hemolytic reactions 

In addition to serologic factors there irc 
other important considerations in selection 
of blood, such as the quantity of blood to 
be transfused Basically this depends on 
medical judgment Units commonly avail 
able contain 450 to 500 ml of blood In 
specific conditions it is advisable to give 
smaller amounts in order not to overload 
the circulation, on the other hand much 
larger amounts may be needed for replace 
ment of blood volume For either volume 
replacement or treatment of anemia a sin 
gle unit of blood is rarely if ever truly in 
dicated In other words such a patient prob 
ably does not even need this single unit of 
blood and therefore should not 1^ exposed 
to the various risks involved in every trans 
fusion Nobody who is aware of the hazards 
of transmission of disease, isosensltlzaiion 
and simihr poicntia} un}oi\ard cITecis of 
blood transfusions can ever justify hemo 
therapy merely as a ‘tonic or sympiomitic 
treatment Furthermore blood is aivv.iys in 
short supply and must be restrved for those 
in need of massive blood replacement diir 
ing surgery, current demands being espe- 
cially high in connection vviih open heart 
surgery 

Close cooperation between clinician and 
hcmothcrapist is also required in connec- 
tion with qualitative aspects of blood for 
transfusion such as the age of stortd 
blood When replacement of blood volume 
IS the indication for transfusion blood of 
the appropriate type with the longest shclf- 
Ijfe Is to be used so as to avoid excessive 
loss from overaging On the other hind for 
patients with certain diseases blood within 
specified age limits is necessary or prt 
ferred Patients ntcding blood because of 
inadequate crythropoicsis or excessive red 
cell destruction should be given blood not 
older than five davs since this will pro- 
vide red cells with maximum survlvi! like 
wise transfusions to patients with hemor 
rhagic diseases should utilire blood not

of the coagulation factors may detenorate 
during more prolonged storage Patients 
ivith advanced renal or cardiovascular dis 
ease should not receive blood older than 
seven days since plasma potassium concen 
trations of blood increase with storage and 
may be injunous to such recipients Analo 
gous considerations hold true for patients 
with advanced liver disease in relation to 
rismg ammonia levels in stored blood 
Of particular importance are indications 
for use of certain blood fractions instead 
of whole blood packed red cells are prefer 
able for recipients with impaired myo 
cardial reserve when they require replace 
ment of red cell mass Coagulation factors 
for treatment of some hemorrhagic dis 
orders are best provided by fresh plasma 
especially in hemophilia fibrinogen should 
be given to patients with hypofibrinoge 
nemia and pooled plasma is indicated 
when there is need for expansion of plasma 
volume Platelet concentrates may at least 
temporarily combat serious hemorrhagic 
mamfestations resultmg from thrombocy 
topema In open heart surgery citrated 
blood cannot be used but mstead hepann 
ized blood must be employed Finally cer 
tarn donors should be specifically excluded 
from use for certain pauents namely the 
husband should never be a donor for his 
wife or a child for his mother It is also not 
advisable to transfuse a patient with the 
blood of the same donor more than once 
All these restrictions are based on the 
greater habUity to isosensitization that has 
been proved to be associated with these 
circumstances of transfusions 

5 Selection of blood for iieitborn and 
young tnfajits Because isoagglutinins are 
not formed until a few months after birth 
(cf p 266) reliable crossmatchmg tests 
cannot be performed with the serum of new 
bom or young infants Any isoagglutinins 
present m such infants are derived from 
the maternal serum as a result of transpla 
cental transmission Hence it is mandatory 
that the major crossmatching test in selec 
tion of blood for infants be earned out with 
the serum of the mother If the child is 
between one to three months of age the 
major crossmatch test should be done with 
both the serum of mother and tlie serum 
of infant smee passively transferred as 
well as actively formed isoagglutinins may 
be present at this age Additional considera 
tions apply to transfusion of infants with 
hemolytic disease of the newborn as dis 
cussed In the subsequent section (p 312) 

6 Uniiersal donor and 'tninersal 


recipients In some circumstances it may 
be necessary to deviate from the rule of 
admimstenng blood of the same ABO group 
as the recipient (e g when Rh negative 
blood of type B or AB is not available) Use 
of O Rh negative blood is then necessary 
for recipients who are A or B, or AB Rh 
negative recipients may be transfused with 
A or B Rh negative blood However, when 
ever a transfusion mvolves “universal do 
nors” or “universal recipients” precautions 
must be taken in order to eliminate the 
nsk of damagmg the reapients red cells 
by the transfused isoagglutinins The safety 
of such transfusions should be established 
by the following entena The serum of the 
blood to be used should not possess hemoly 
sm for the red cells of the prospective re 
cipient e g group O blood with anu A 
hemolysin should not be used for a recipi 
ent of group A or AB The titer of the 
reacuve isoagglutinm should be less than 
1 100 (cf p 293) The minor crossmatch 
test should be performed with the neutral 
ized serum of the donor as outlined on p 
297 Only if this test fails to show agglutina 
tion IS It safe to use the umverstd donor 
for a recipient of another blood group or 
to transfuse the “universal recipient with 
the blood tentatively selected 
Another situation in which “universal 
donor blood may have to be used is the 
“emergency transfusion when the urgency 
of replacement of blood volume precludes 
spending any time for pretransfusion tests 
In this event it is best to use O Rh negative 
(ede) blood with low titers of anti A and 
anti B The decision to administer blood 
without prctransfusion tests must be made 
by the physiaan In charge since it Involves 
definite calculated risks in rare instances 
the patient may already possess an anti 
body for one of the factors in the transfused 
blood In addition there is the delayed risk 
of isosensitization Obviously this pro 
cedure is therefore only justified in a true 
emergency but not in pseudoemergencies 
such as failure to request on time or to 
prepare blood for surgery or similar cir 
cumstances

with in this context it is important to be 
aware of the need for strict observance of 
the follovvmg precautions 

All safeguaids must be taken to insure 
proper identity of the blood selected and of 
the patient to be transfused Some of the 
most senous transfusion accidents have

asepsis must be obser%cd in admmistration 
of the blood Excessive speed or excessively 
slow administration of blood must be 
avoided No solution other than physiologic 
sabne or glucose in physiologic saline 
should be admimstered through the same 
set as blood Specifically so called isotonic 
glucose solution in water should be avoided 
since it ivas found capable of hemolysing 
blood mixed with it Finally close observa 
tion of the patient during the transfusion 
IS essential to detect as soon as possible 
any untoward reactions that may occur 
S liwestigntion of transfusion reac 
tions The mam purpose of such Investiga 
tions IS to rule out or prove that a specific 
reaction reflects hemolysis of transfused 
red cells brought about by antibodies 
present in the recipient or more rarely de 
structlon of recipients red cells by irans 
fused antibodies Table 5-13 lists the 
common clinical symptoms as well as the 
classic laboratory findings that character 
ize the mam categories of transfusion reac 
tions It must be stressed that absence of 
clinical symptoms does not conclusively 
ebminatc a specific cause of a reaction On 
the other hand certain chmcal findings 
such as urticarial eruptions may occur jn 
more than one type of reaction and there 
fore by themselves do not permit definitive 
diagnosis Finally some reactions includ

and escape detection unless there is careful

be preserved for at least five days as men

It has recentlj been shown that some 
pyrogenic (febnle) reactions are caused 
by presence of Icukoagglutimns in the re 
cjpient Persons most hkely to develop leu 
koagglutmins are recipients of muluple 
previous transfusions and multiparous 
women the latter apparently being sensi 
tized by fetal leukocytic antigens (Dausset. 
1954 Payne, 1957, and Bnttingham 
1957) The presence of leukoagglutinlus 
may be detected by tests described on p 


317 Demonstration of this etiology of pyro- 
genic febnle transfusion reactions is im- 
portant practically, since considerable diffi 
culties are encountered in hemotherapy of 
such patients, especially if they require 
repeated transfusions because of conditions 
such as aplastic anemia or myelofibrosis 
If pjTfogemc reactions are found to be asso- 
ciated with presence of leukoagglulinms or 
if this mechanism is suspected even though 
St Is not established, they can be m most 
instances readily eliminated by using for 
transfusion a red cell mass prepared in such 
a manner as to be practically free of leuko- 
cytes

be due to bactenal contamination of the 
transfused blood thorough bactenologic 
examination must be earned out by means 
of direct smears as well as by culture of 
the blood (For methods suitable for this 
purpose, see p 835ff ) It must be specifically 
emphasized that such cultures must be 
incubated not only at 37° C but also at 
30 to 32° C and preferably even at lower

Hemolytic Disease of llu. ^icvilxim 
(Fetal Erythroblastosis) 

I Eiiology Levine and associates 
(1941) advanced the hypothesis that hemo- 
lytic disease of the newborn may be the re- 
sult of formation of Uh anubodies in an Ith 
negative woman carrying on Rh positive

fetus This has since been amply confinned 
by numerous chnical and laboratory studies 
One of the most direct pieces of evidence 
has been the recent demonstration of Rh 
positue red cells obviously domed from 
the fetus in the penpherti blood of Rh 
negative pregnant women by means of 
fluorescein labeled antiserums (Cohen 
Zuelzer and Evans I9G0) 

Statistically infants with climcal evi 
dence of erythroblastosis are most fre 
quently Rh positive infants of Rh negative 
mothers possessing Rh antibodies Although 
in earber work Rh antibodies were not 
readily detectable in all these women this 
was subsequently accompUshed by use of 
techniques capable of detecting incomplete 
antibodies (cf p 274) It is now well 
known that in addition to Rh„(D) feto- 
matcmal differences Jn many other blood 
factors may induce maternal isosensitiza 
tion and hemolytic disease although this 
occurs much more rarely Of specific inter 
est is ABO incompatibility as a cause of 
maternal isosensiuzauon expectant moth 
ers may form “immune" or incomplete anti 
bodies in addition to “natural" isoaggtuti 
nins already present and transplacental 
transmission of the antibodies may produce 
clinical symptoms similar to those resulting 
from other uicompauble antibodies As a 
rule however severe clinical disease ovnng 
to A and B sensitization is much rarer than 
that caused by Rh sensitization Subclinical 
forms or mild disease expressed as slight 
jaun^ce appearing before the tiurd day of 


Ejvboratorv Methods 

life spherocytosis and moderate red 
cytosis are observed more frequently 
2 Pathogenesis Entry into the 
temal circulauon of fetal red cells is 
cially common dunng and nght 
delivery This may explain why Rh 
bodies often are first detected a few v 
after delivery As a rule Rh antibody 
not develop during the first pregnant 
an Rh negative vvoman bearing an 
positixe fetus unless they were stimu^ 
by preceding transfusion of Rb po‘ 
blood Most commonly two or three ] 
nancies are needed for development o 
antibodies Frequently even a much ]j 
number of pregnancies with Rh pos 
fetuses does not lead to formation ol 
antibodies in Rh negative women On 
basis of statistical analyses of large s 
only approximately one out of ten Rh r 
me vvomen potentially exposed to Rh s 
tization by pregnancy actually devt 
antibodies 

Once antibodies are present they 
pass to the fetus transplacentally Aci 
Ing to Wiener this is much more likely 
incomplete than vvjth complete antiboi 
(his concept has been amply confirmei 
appropriate tests on serum of cord b 
specimens Apparently this reflects 
larger molecular size of complete antibc 
as compared with incomplete ones 

The most severe form of hemo! 
disease (hydrops fetalis) is the resul 
damage to fetal red cells of sufficient se 
ity to cause intrauterine death If on

other hand, the child is horn alive it may form of the disease is associated with a 
present one of two forms of disease The gradual destruction of the red cells coated 
first, more senous form is characterized b> with Rh antibody and leads to a hemolytic 
rapid development of jaundice resulting anemia similar to that found in patients

portions of the central nervous system by important chnical pathologic and chnico

described for the disease associated uaih 
Rh sensitization At the same time it must 
be emphasized that none of the clinical 
pathologic and clinicopathologic findings is 
stnctly specific for the disease since they 
can also be found In a number of other 
conditions Points of differential diagnostic 
significance are listed in Table 5-16 

S Prenatal dmgnojw Because of the 
nonspecificiiy of clinical pathologic and 
hematologic findings m hemolytic disease 
of the newborn the results of serologic 
tests are of paramount importance Further 
more if at all possible the potential oc 
currence of the disease should be e\aluated 
prenatally m order to be prepared for proper 
neonatal treatment witbout delay For this 
reason certain prenatal tests should be car 
ned out on all expectant mothers Accord 
ing to the general scheme of such tests in 
dicated in Fig 5-7 the first and crucial 
test is that for the Rh„(D) factor If the 
patient is found to be Rh„(D)positi\e as 
a rule no further tests are necessary On 
the other hand all Rh (D) negatne women 
are potential candidates for Rh sensitization 
provided their husbands are Rh„(D) posi 
me For that reason the serums of such 
patients should be screened for presence of 
Rh antibodies The solid black segment In 
the innermost circle of Fig 5-7 represents 
the approximate percentage of Rh sensl 
uzed women one may expect to delect upon 
prenatal testing It is the infants of these 
women in whom hemolytic disease may 
liccomc manifest proxlded they are Rh 
positne 

Table 5-17 outlines schematically pre 
natal tests the results of which to a certain 
extent permit predicting the likelihood of 
disease in the infant Table 5-18 contains 


additional tests that should be earned out 
in Rh sensitized pregnant women in order 
to obtain some prognostic information con 
ceming the severity of disease to be ex 
peeled Repeated screening for Rh anti 
bodies is desirable since a negative test 
early in pregnancy may induce a false 
sense of security responsible for failure to 
search for and detect subsequent develop- 
ment of Rh antibodies On the other hand 
ii Rh antibody tesung was done only close 
to term and showed a positive residt the 
length of exposure of the fetus to Rh 
antibodies cannot be established Further 
more repetition of antibody examinations 
dunng vanous stages of pregnancy may 
detect a rise in antibody titer Such a rise 
can be accepted as significant only if the 
two specimens to be compared are tested 
simultaneously with the same technique 
reagents and test cells Such titrations 
should preferably be done volumetncally 
(cf p 293) If in this manner a nse in 
antibodies is established this can be taken 
as proving almost conclusively that the 
fetus carried in the respective pregnancy is 
Rh positive since presumably its red cells 
have provided the additional antigenic 
stimulus 

There is no unanimity of opinion whether 
or not valid prognostic information can be 
demed from the relative amounts — titers — 
of Rh antibodies in individual patients 
Statistically they seem to be useful inas 
much as “high" titers of Rh antibodies arc 
more likely to be followed by manifest or 
severe disease in the newborn than "low^ 
titers What is to be considered as “high" 
or “low" titer depends on the techniques 
employed and therefore must be established 
empmcally in each laboratory Definite

prognostic significance can be assigned 
only to the finding of complete antibodies 
they are less likely to produce disease since 
they do not reach the fetus so readily as do 
incomplete antibodies Finally the length of 
exposure to antibodies influences both the 
likelihood and degree of clinical disease 
short periods of exposure are less likely to 
produce serious disease than longer penods 
At the same time one must remember that 
these criteria have only general validity and 
that exceptions to the rule do occur A 
change of opinion has taken place con 
cerning the prognostic evaluation of the 
past obstetrical history Undoubtedly a pre 
vious neonatal death attributable to ma 
ternal isosensitization is an unfavorable 
factor Nevertheless in roughly one out of 
three or four pregnancies with an Rh post 


live fetus following a previous stillbirth 
caused by Rh sensitization, a Uve Rh posi 
live child may be dehvered who though 
diseased may be treated successfully with 
replacement transfusion 

Once Rh sensitization of an Rh negative 
vroman has taken place the prognosis for 
subsequent pregnancies is significantly 
affected by the zygosity of her husband for 
the Rh factor In this situation Rh geno 
typing (cf tests outlined on p 277) is of 
considerable importance, because the re 
suits permit estimation of the odds for the 
likelihood of an Rh negative child from a 
subsequent pregnancy (cf Table 5-10) Ob 
vioudy no amount of Rh antibodies can do 
any damage to a fetus or infant Jacking

Let ino and many subsequent in' estigatore

peritnenlaUy it was confirmed that injec-

cells is much Jess likely to induce RIi scnsl

red cells (Stem Datldsohn and Masaitis

If the red cells of the husband arc tncom 
pitible in the ABO system with the scrum 
of hi*; wife (hcterospcciric mating) this 
entails a lesser chance for Rh sensitization 
than docs a homospccific mating in which 
the scrum of the wife is compatible with 
the red cells of her husband in the ABO 
system For this reason Rh sensitization 
is almost never found in O Rh negaiive

clinical hemolytic disease of the newborn 
mving to Rh incompatibility can be ruled 
out if the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) lest 
IS negatiie On the other hand a positive 
direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test may be 
associated not only with manifest disease 
but also with latent disease in which no 
other abnormal clinical or laboratory find 
ings are obtained Proper interpretation of 
laboratory tests is essential for establishing 
mdication for treatment of hemol>Uc dis 
ease with replacement transfusion (De 
tailed discussion of this problem may be 
found in the monographs of MoUison 1962 
and Allen and Diamond 1958 ) The four 
cntical laboratory tests are the direct anti 
globulin (Coombs) test hemoglobin or 
hematocnt of cord blood reticulocyte 
count and indirect serum bilirubin re 
peated every six hours through the first 
two to three days of life Abnormalities in 
these tests together with abnormal clinical 
findings or history of a previously diseased 
child as a rule furnish the mam indications 
for replacement transfusion which is the 
treatment of choice since it offers the 
greatest assurance of recover) and cepe 
cially of prevention of bilirubin encepha 
lopathy 

Controversial opinions have been ex 
pressed about the frequency with which a 
positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test 
IS obtained in infants with AB hemolytic 
disease Recent work has indicated that this 
variability reflects mainly the differences m 
selection of antiglobulin serums for the 
test reagents particularly suitable for de 
tection of coating of red cells vWth anil A 
and anti B can be prepared and give posi 
tive results Another important confirma 
tory test for diagnosis of hemolytic disease 
of the newborn caused by AB sensitization

transfusions should preferably be not older 
than three days If it dilTers in the ABO 
group from that of the infant one must 
make sure that the isoagglutmin reacihe 
with the infants red cells is not of the 
immune" type (cf p 302) For simple 
transfusions given merely to correct 
anemia similar critena for selection of 
blood apply As to quantitative factors sue 
cessful replacement transfusions require at 
least 70 ml of blood per pound of weight 
in simple transfusions not more than 10 
ml of blood per pound should be given For 
the latter purpose it may be preferable to 
use packed red cells rather than whole 
blood since m this wav more red cell mass 
can be administered 

After replacement transfusions or in un 
treated cases vvith latent disease the fol 
lowing laboratory tests are essential for 
follow up purposes direct antiglobulin 
(Coombs) test indirect scrum bilirubin 
hemoglobm or hematocrit and reticulocyte 
count It is also recommended to test a 
postpartum specimen from a sensitized 
mother about three to four weeks after 
delivery since a rise in titer may occur at 
that time Therefore the antibody level 
ascertained at that ume furnishes the most 
reliable baseline of comparison in future 
pregnancies 

HI Autoimmune Ilcmolyiic Antnin Im 
munohematologic tests applied to this con 
dition arc significant for three reasons 
First the unequivocal diagnosis of the dis 
ease requires demonstration of autoanii 
bodies Second autoantibodies may repre 
sent a source of error in the proper inier 
prctation of results of ABO and Rh typing 
tests Finally, hemotherapy of pailcnis with 
this disease may meet with considerable 
dilficulUes and therefore necessitate modi 
fications of laboratory tests used for sclec 
tion of blood — specifically of crossmaich 
Ing tests 

Diagoosts Diagnosis of autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia proceeds in three steps 
as indicated In Figure 5-8 (1) establish 
ment of accelerated destruction or shortened 
survival of red cells (2) demonstration of 
extracorpiiscular factors as the cause of 
this red cell destruction and (3) idcntifi 
cation of the extracorpuscular factors as 
autoantibodics Since most autoantibodies 
are incomplete the techniques most suit 
able for their detection arc the inthrect anti 
globulin (Coombs) test and liie use of 
enzyme-troated red cells As ,a first step the 
direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test should 
always be done on the red cells of the 



Blood Groups and 

patient. If this test is positive and docs not 
reflect passive transfer of isoantibodies 
(e.g., hemolytic disease of the newborn) or 
transfusion of Incompatible blood within 
the recent past, it is prima facie evidence 
for the presence of autoantibodies. On the 
other hand negative direct antiglobuJin 
(Coombs) tests are occasionally found In 
some cases of autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia, probably more frequently in pa- 
tients during or after intensive steroid 
therapy (Davidsohn, 1954). In such in- 
stances it is essential to test the serum of the 
patient for autoantibodlcs by having it act 
on random samples of cells of group O. 
Since most autoantibodies are of the 
“warm” type, these tests should be incu- 
bated at 37® C, In other instances "cold” 
autoantibodies are encountered, requiring 
incubation at 4® C. In either event, after 
incubation of saline-suspended red cells, the 
test is converted Into the indirect antiglobu- 
lin technique (cf. p. 286); as an ahernative 
the patient’s serum may be tested with 
papain-treated red cells (cf. p. 288). 

By merely suspending red cells that are 
heavily sensitized with autoantibodlcs in 
their own scrum or in macrontolccular 
medium, such as bovine albumin, aggluti- 
nation may take place. Although this tech- 
nique may be used for demonstrating 
the presence of autoanilbodies. the phenome- 
non is more importanf as a source cf error in 
ABO grouping and Rh typing. In such tests 
agglutinations may occur that arc not the 
results of specific antigen-antibody reac- 
tions but merely reflect agglutination of 
antibody-coated cells in macromolecular 
medium. This is particularly prone to occur 
in slide techniques for ABO grouping, the

hemotytfe anemia.

nonsj^cific clumping leading to erroneous 
classification of a blood sample as AB. 
The error can be readily detected by sus- 
pending the red cells in their own serum 
or in the serum of a person of group AB. 
By the same token, nonspecific and fre- 
quently erroneous results may occur in Rh 
typing of “coated” red cells When these 
tests use incomplete antibodies necessitat- 
ing suspension of red cells in macromo- 
Iccular medium. For this reason it is 
preferable to use saline agglutinating anti- 
serums for Rh typing of such samples in 
order to eliminate this source of error. In 
extreme cases it may be impossible to ob- 
tain reliable Rh types of such red cell 
specimens. Likewise in the presence of a 
positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test 
it is not possible to determine the blood 
factors that require as a rule the indirect 
antiglobulin technique, such as factors D", 
Kell, and Duffy. 

7Viern/»y. Hemotherapy of patients with 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia depends 
primarily on medical decisions as to 
whether to transfuse at all and. if so, what 
quantities and what forms of blood are to 
be used. Since in severe cases of autoim- 
mune hemolytic anemia as a rule, it is not 
possible to find any blood that is completely 
compatible, one must attempt to select the 
lo.ist incompatible blood. For this purpose 
sensitive (ecimlques, such as tite indirect 
antiglobulin (Coombs) test or the use of 
enzyme-treated red cells, including the cys- 
tcinc-papain technique (p. 296), are used 
with serial dilutions of the patient’s serum. 
As a control one may use the red cells of 
the patient exposed to his own serum. In 
this way one is able to select among niuner- 
ous units the one with the lowest titer or 
the weakest degree of agglutination. Ac- 
cording to studies of several authors 
(Weiner (1953); van Loghem (1954); 
Davidsohn (1953)) some autoantibodies 
possess specificity for certain blood factors. 
If such specificity is suspected or estab- 
lished, it is a helpful guide in selection of 
blood. The minor crossmatch in such cases 
cannot be carried out by means of the in- 
direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test If the 
direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test on the 
patient’s red cells is positive. For discussion 
of hematologic findmgs and their si^iifi- 
cance In the diagnosis and treatment of 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia see chapter 
on hematology (p. 172ff.).

Figure 5-9 Use of the ABO syseem for exclusion of pareiioge Children of groups in shaded area ai 
exclude 


cation IS based on tbe Mendelian mhen 
tance of blood factors referred to previ 
ously (cf p 263) The foUoiving general 
pnnciples must be understood in order to 
interpret properly blood grouping for pos 
sible exclusion of parentage 

1 Each person mhencs one paternal 
and one maternal allele for each blood 
factor 

2 In logical consequence of this mode 
of Inheritance a person can be cither homo- 
zygous or heterozygous for each blood 
factor 

3 In the case of some blood factors 
It IS possible to distinguish between homo 
zygotes and hetcrozygotes whereas for 
other blood factors this is not possible 

4 A person cannot possess a blood 
factor that is absent from the blood of both 
father and mother 

5 A blood factor cannot be absent in 
a person if one of his parents is homo- 
zygous for this factor 

6 If a parent is heterozygous for a 
factor of which both alleles can be demon 
strated by suitable tests his child must 
possess a blood factor corresponduig to 
one of these two alleles 

By applying these pnnciples to the ABO 
system persons with certain ABO groups 
can be excluded from parentage as indi 
cated in Fig 5-9 ^Vhlle such tests most 
commonly are utilized for exclusion of 
paternity the same rules apply lo excJu 
Sion of maternity Therefore the matings 
sho«n in Fig 5-9 are not specified as to 
sex of the patent Pnnciple 4 mentioned in 
the preceding section permits formulation 
of the first hw of mhentance 

Factors Aor B cannot appear in a child 

unless present in one or both parents 


Pnnciple 6 applied to the ABO systei 
permits formulation of the second laii c 
tnheniance 

A parent of group AB cannot have 
child of group O 

Finally pnnciple 5 adapted to the AB( 
system results in the third law of tnher. 
tance 

A parent of group 0 cannot haii i 
chdd of group AB 

In many thousands of tests done fo 
medicolegal purposes or genetic studies ni 
excepuon whaisoeter was found to the firs 
law of inheritance On the other hand iwi 
cases are on record of children of group C 
bom to mothers of group A-B without inj 
possible doubt of maternity Hence exclu 
sions based on the second and third laiv; 
of inheritance may have to be considerct 
somewhat less stnngont than those basec 
on the first law of mhentance Nevcrihe 
less It must be realized that apparent viola 
tjons of the second and third laws of in 
hentance are exceedingly rare they pos 
sibly result from mutations an assumption 
supported by the finding that at least one 
of the infants of group O tvith an A8 
mother showed multiple congenital ab 
normalities 

Figure 5-10 summanzes possible exclu 
sions from parentage of children of certain 
MN types The laws of mhentance of MN 
factors may be also demed from general 
principles of Mendelian inheritance Prin 
ciple 4 applied to the MN system results in 
the fourth law of mhentance 

A child cannot possess M or N unless 
these factors arc present in the blood 
of one or both parents 

Principle 5 gives nse to the fifth aiid 
sixth laws of inheritance

Because of the complexity of factors and 
o? the RU system (cf Table 
5 8) Rh testing for exclusion of parentage 
requires additional considerations If prop 
erly carried out if can contnliutc a great 
deal As a nilc factors Jlbo(B) rh (C) 
rh (E) and hr'(c) arc determined Factor 
hr'(e) may be also determined protided 
reliable and potent antiserums are a\aU 
able Results of such Rh tests as inter 
preted by general principles of inheritance 
permit the foIlotMng conclusions 

1 None of the Rh factors IRh (D) rh 
(C) rh (E) hr'(c) hr' (e)| can be present 
in a person unless one or both parents pos 
sess the corresponding factor 

2 A parent lacking the rh (C) factor can 
not ha\e a child \Mthoui the h]^(c) factor 
Mce >ersa a parent lacking the hr'(c) fac- 
tor cannot have a child without the rh (C) 
factor 

3 A parent lacking the rh (E) factor 
cannot hate a child without the hr'(e) 
factor Mce versa a parent Jacking the 
hr' (e) factor cannot have a child without 
the rh (E) factor 

The chances for excluding a person from 
parentage of a specific child arc approxl 
matcly 25 per cent by use of the ABO 
groups alone the chances nse to 31 per 
cent when ABO and MN factors are de 
lermined and to approximately 50 per cent 
by testing for ABO MN and Rh factors 
These figures arc derived from tests on the 
U S Caucasoid population and depend 
critically on the distribution of the factors 


315 

in the population There are several reasons 
why other blood group systems discussed 
in the previous sections are not utilized for 
exclusion of parentage (a) sufficient quan 
titles of potent and specific antiserums are 
not available (b) m some of these systems 
studies of inheritance based on knowledge 
of alleles have not yet reached a stage 
warranting acceptance of results for medi 
colegal purposes and (c) even without 
these restrictions of v alidity the actual gain 
would be rather minimal Wiener and Wex 
ler (I9SS) stated that combined use of all 
other known blood factors would at most 
add only 12 to 35 per cent to the chances 
of exclusions Finally it must be empha 
sized that blood grouping tests as described 
can only be used for exclusion of parentage 
but never for establishing parentage Ex 
ceptions to this rule are exceedingly rare 
if the child and one parent possess one of 
the unusual “private or “family factors 
(cf p 278) this may be considered as 
strong presumptive evidence for parentage 
Technical Considerations in Tests 
FOR Exclusion of Parentage Although 
the techniques employed for this purpose 
arc essential]) the same as those described 
in the previous sections it cannot be cm 
phasized enough that proper performance 
of parentage tests requires a good deal of 
expenence and expertness This includes 
use of adequate red cell controls in order 
to assure specific and sensitive performance 
of the antiserums It is advisable to use 
more than one antiserum for the tests es 
pecially for MN and Rh factors The ABO 
grouping may be supplemented by use of 
anti Ai serum (cf p 283) in order to sub- 
group A and AB into A and AjB or into

or A»B In this waj it is possible to 
uiibze consideration of inhentance of A, 
as an additional means for exclusion of 
parentage As shown in Table 5-4 while 
persons of A, may be either homozygous 
or heterozygous for this factor in cither 
event their red cells react as A, Hence 
one may den\e an additional law of ABO 
inhentance 

A person of A,B cannot have a child 
of grojip Af lice versa n person of 
group Ag cannot have a child of group 
A,B 

Cautions for Interpretations of 
Exclusions of Parentage Apart from the 
exceedingly remote possibility that muta 
tions are responsible for violations of laws 
of inhentance some specific qualifications 
must be kept in mmd when Interpreting ex 
elusion of parentage 

1 ABO system Possible presence of weak 
subgroups of A must not be overlooked 
Furthermore exclusion based on differences 
in subgroups cannot be considered valid 
if It concerns a child under the age of one 
year since tests for subgroups of A are 
unreliable at this age Finall) exceedingly 
rare cases have been reported of “suppres 
sor genes which when present in one of 
the parents in homozygous form make it 
impossible to detect A or B factors in the 
red cells although the factor may be 
present in his offspring because he is het 
crozygous for the suppressor gene 

2 MN system A third allele M* of ex 
ceedingly rare occurrence may lead to an 
apparent violation of the laws of inbcn 
tance of MN types as described previously 
eg a person who seemingly is I)!?® N but 
actually is type M*N may have a child M 
from a mother M the true 1)116 of the child 
being MMif Furthermore there are weak 
subgroups of N(N ) that may be missed 
and thus lead to erroneous typing and in 
teroretation 

3 Rh s)Stem The apparent absence of 
Rh„(D) can only be used for exclusion of 
parentage provided suitable tests have also 
shown absence of Rh„ variants (D" factor) 
Otherwise for example a person could be 
erroneousl) excluded as the parent of an 
Rh positive child because he and the other 
parent were found to be Rh negative This 
is especiall) important in connection with 
the Rho variant (D ) when it represents a 
suppression of reactivit) of Rh„(D) because 
of presence of rh(C) 

The rare t>'pe fib ( D ) ma) lead to 
misinterpretations inasmuch as its pres 
ence invalidates the laws of inheritance 
formulated for factors rh(C) hr'fc) rh 


Laboratorv AfFTiions 

(E) and hr'(c) Suitable tests and con 
sideration of Rh types of parents and child 
can eliminate these pitfalls (Stem 19o9) 
Properl) executed and interpreted blood 
grouping tests are now accepted as evidence 
for exclusion of parentage in the courts of 
14 states Because of the medicolegal im 
portance of these tests a special committee 
of the Amencan Medical Association has 
issued periodic reports that incorporate the 
latest developments in this fold and thus 
serve as guide for all those engaged in this 
work 

2 Identificaltoti of blood stains and se 
crettons Blood grouping tests can provide 
valuable evidence in connection with pos 
sible identity of blood stains found on 
clothing utensils and instruments presum 
ably mvoKedin assault with the blood of per 
sons involved in crime or accidents (David 
sohn 1958) However such tests are by no 
means so simple as those routinely used 
because onl) rarel) is material available that 
is fresh enough to permit preparation of rod 
cel! suspensions capable of being reliably 
agglutinated by the corrcsjionding antlscr 
urns Most commonly it is necessar) to pre 
pare extracts of the blood scams or spots 
in which specific blood factors arc demon 
straicd by mixing the extract with known 
antiserum (eg anti A) and determining 
that in this mixture agglutinating actlvit) 
has been inhibited or neutralized Thus 
material eluted from a blood stain and 
found capable of slgniricantl) inhibiting 
anti A serum presumably has contained 
blood factor A In order to control sources 
of error such as nonspecific absorption of 
antibody suitable controls must be in 
eluded and adequate perfomiancc and in 
tcrpretaiion of these tests requires consider 
able cxpencnce Simihr considerations ap-

This ma) also apply to identification of 
blood by species that Is in cases in which 
a blood stun might be of human or animal

Blood Groups and Thur Application 


317 


V Anthropologic and Genetjc Applica 
Hons Blood factors represent the most 
readily accessible and demonstrable genetic 
markers This fact together wth the ag 
nificant differences m distribution of blood 
factors foimd in populations of different 
raaal origin makes their study one of the 
most \aluable and reliable means of an 
thropologic classification Details of this 
fascinating discipline are outside of the 
scope of this text those interested in such 
information are specifically referred to the 
classic monograph on the subject by 
Mourant (1954) 

An apphcation still in the early stage 
utilizes blood groups for folloiving somatic 
mutations as they arise spontaneously or 
under the impact of mutagemc agents and 
disease (Atwood, 1958) In some Instances 
ft has been also possible to use blood groups 
as chromosome markers and to estabhsh 
association wth certain other genetically 
transmitted defects or pecuUanties (Law 
ler) So far only a few specific instances of 
this type have been established but future 
applications are conceivable That one or 
the other alleles of certam blood factors — 
eg A and O— may be more commonly 
associated than other alleles with specific 
diseases such as diabetes permcious ane 
nua gastric ulcer or gastric cancer, has 
been descnbed but the validity and sig 
nificance of the phenomenon are still de 
batable Evidence adduced in favor of 
association between specific blood factors 
and disease is purely statistical Hence a 
great deal of additional mtensive study will 
be required before one may accept it as 
valid 


IMMUNOHEMATOLOGY OF 
LEUKOCYTES 

This area of immunohematology as well 
as that concerned with platelets is only in 
an early stage of development Although 
immunologic phenomena involving leuko 
cytes had been suspected for some time it 
was only within the last decade that con 
elusive proof was furnished for isoantigenic 
differences between leukocytes in man In 
addition to isoantibodies autoantibodies for 
white cells have been demonstrated and 
presumably are associated witli certain 
clinical conditions 

/ fjoreitkoogghitimnf 

Multiple blood transfusions as well as 
pregnancies have been shoivn to be capable 


of producing isoagglutimns for leukocjtes 
in a manner similar to isosensitization to 
red cell antigens (Dausset 1954 Payne 
1957, Bntttngham and Chaplin Jr, 1957 
and van Loghem 1957) The mam clmical 
significance of leukoagglutinins derives from 
their association with pyrogenic (febrile) 
transfusion reactions in approximately one- 
third of such cases Since such patients 
tolerate leukocyte poor blood without any 
untoward reaction, it is logical to assume 
a causal relationship between isosensmza 
tion to leukocytes and such transfusion re 
actions Much less commonly but docu 
menied by a number of recent case reports 
neonatal neutropenia may result from trans 
placental transfer of isoleukoaggluimins 
formed by a pregnant woman for maternal 
white cells of her fetus presumably con 
taming isoantigens of paternal origin ab 
sent in the mother This in analogy to red 
cell isosensitization might be well desig 
nated as “leukolytic disease of the new 
bom Thus there is little doubt for the 
existence of leukocyte groups They have 
been shown to be independent of red cell 
factors and as yet have not been classified 
This makes it necessary to utilize arbitrarily 
selected panels of white cell donors vvhen 
ever serums suspected of contaimng leuko 
agglutinins are to be tested It has been 
recommended that six to twelve different 
white cell donors be used m order to assure 
inclusion of the various leukocyte isoanti 
gens 

Technique for Tests for Isoleukoaggluti 
nins (Payne, 1957) Leukocytes are scpi 
rated from whole blood by methods of dif 
ferential sedimentation Following incuba 
tion of the ieukocyte suspension with the 
serum to be tested the presence or absence 
of agglutination is established by micro 
scopic examination (Fig 5-1 1)

pbsh Dausset (1960) has reported that

has as its first step exposure of the pre 
sumably sensitized leukocytes to an anti 
human globulin scrum of knowTi titer If 
the leukocytes actually were coated with 
autoantibodics a considerable amount of 
the antiglobuhn antibody would be con 
sumed for it becomes fixed to the white 
cells Therefore when tested in parallel 
with the original antiglobulin scrum the 
supernatant shows a significant drop in 
the antiglobulm titer

platelets, they are not responsible for plate 
let agglutinins which apparently reflect 
other isoantigenlc differences The tech 
niques for detection of platelet antibodies 
are cumbersome, difhcult to reproduce, and 
hence not ready for routine applications 
This holds true eien more for autoanli 
bodies for platelets (autothromboaggluti 
mns) Dausset has successfully applied the 
direct antiglobulin consumption test for 
detection of platelet autoantlbodies, the 
principle and technique are analogous to 
those described in the preceding section on 
leukocyte autoantibodies A rather unique 
phenomenon concerns the thrombolytic 
effect of serum of patients who develop 
thrombocytopenia as an expression of hy- 
persensitivity to certain drugs (sedormid, 
qumidine) When their scrum is mixed 
with platdets in vitro, thrombolysis occurs 
but only if the incriminated drug has been 
also added (Ackroyd, 1949, Harrington e/ 
fli , 1951)

Laboratory Diagnosis of 
Hemorrhagic Disorders 


By EMANUEL E. MANDEL, M.D. 


One of the outstanding characteristics o£ 
blood IS Its property to remain liquid while 
circulating through the vascular system, at 
the same tune retairung its ability to co- 
agulate when the vascular system is injured 
ihat blood clots when it is shed but is 
usually liquid intravascularly was well 
knmvn to the ancient Greeks and Romans 
They distmguished between the serum, the 
huffy coat, and the blood clot Some 2000 
years after the discovery was made that a 
sobd substance could be separated from the 
blood by whippmg, Malpighi (1666) ob- 
served strands of fibers remaining after a 
clot of blood was washed Nearly two cen 
tunes later, Buebanazj (1845} Tioted that 
adding fresh serum to plasma resulted in 
prompt formation of fibnn The agent in 
the serum responsible for this effect was 
thought by Schmidt (1893 1895) to be 
an enayme, which he termed “thrombin " 
Schmidt also postulated the existence in 
plasma of a precursor of thrombin (later 
named “prothrombin"), which required for 
Its activation a substance contained in 
tissues After Hammarsten (1877) had iso- 
lated fibrinogen, and Arthus and Pages 
(1890) had demonstrated the anticoagulant 
effect of oxalate and thus the importance 
of calcium for coagulation. Morawitz 
(1904) combmed the available data into 
the following classic theory prothrombm 
plus calcium plus tissue thrombokinase 
(thromboplastin) yields thxombm, fibnn 
ogen plus thrombin yields fibnn Shortly 
thereafter, the concept of blood borne, m 


tnnsic thromboplastin was initiated when 
Bordet and Delonge (1912) suggested that 
the platelets furnished cytozyme (synonj- 
mous with thromboplastin) 

The soundness of these histone observa 
lions can be illustrated readily by correlat 
ing them with some of the tests currently 
us^ Normal venous blood collected m a 
plain glass tube remains bquid for 8 to 12 
minutes until, quite suddenly, it becomes 
VISCOUS and gds moments later These 
changes encompass what are now recog 
nizcd as the three phases of coagulation, 
I, n, HI (see Table 6—1) If an ahquot of 
the same freshly drawm blood sample is 
promptly mixed with a drop of fresh sonutd 
serum, the total clotting time is reduced to 
one to three seconds Oxalated or citrated 
blood or plasma is clotted just as promptly 
by the same treatment, mdicating that cal- 
cium IS not essential for this reaction 
Fresh serum contains a substance (throm 
bin) that forms in the course of clotting and 
is capable of rapidly converting fibnnogen 
to fibnn (phase ID, thrombin time) When 
oxalated blood or plasma is incubated at 
56® C for a few minutes and centrifuged, 
no clot forms when fresh serum or throm 
bin solution is added to the supernatant 
because fibnnogen has been preapitated 
during the incubation Adding calcium 
chlonde to oxalated normal plasma in 
proper concentration and proportion is fol 
lowed by the formanon of a fibnn clot 
withm two or three minutes (recalcification 
tune) TJiis penod is shortened to 12 to 14

hidc&nUelf if tissue thcambaplasun is

is required for the formation of thrombin

or not tissue thromboplastm is added Ob 
viously actne thrombin cannot be con

Smee the "tissue thromboplastin time” 
is much shorter than the Yecalcification 
time, one must assume that adding cal 
cium alone results in spontaneous but slow 
generation of a substance hating thrombo- 
plastin like activity (ininnsic thrombo- 
plastin phase I) ivbich takes much longer 
than the interaction of preformed tissue 
thromboplastin with prothrombm to form 
thrombin The short “thromboplastin time 
in turn is always longer than the “thrombin 


lime” (using each reagent in optimal con 
ccntraiion) and evidently includes both 
phases conversion of thrombin precursor 
(prothrombin) to thrombin and of fibnn 
ogen to Rban Platelet poor plasma yields 
a longer recalcification time than platelet 
rich plasma but practically the same throm 
boplastm or thrombin time Indicating that 
platelets contnbute essentially to the forma 
uon of intrmsic thromboplastin but not to 
the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin 
or of fibrinogen to fibnn However platelets 
do have an accelerating influence upon the 
conversion of fibrinogen (see Fig 6-1, Table

signify pathways that have been 
suggested but not clearly established 


utes Blood flow in the \essel is thereby 
slowed dovm and \i the vessel Is small 
enough completely stopped Thromboplastin 
released from endothelium of tissues brings 
about production of thrombin which in 
turn contributes to agglutination (white 
thrombus) and lysis of platelets and to the 
formation of a flbnn clot Meanwhile "in 
trinsic” thromboplastin is formed and re- 
sults in more thrombin 

A \asoconstrictive substance released 
from the platelets is presumed to add to the 
reflex vascular contraction and prolongs its 
effect As fibnn retracts under the mfiuence 
of the retracto-enzjTne" of the platelets 
nascent thrombin is expressed which lends 
to agglutinate more platelets (autocatalytic 
reaction) and thus may cause further 
growth of the thrombus At the same time 
thrombin is adsorbed on Cbnn (which is 
considered by Quick to be the most unpor 
tant “anuthrombic" substance) thus lima 
mg the clot promoting effect of thrombin 
Accordmg to Quick hemostasis depends on 
the continuous slow production of throm 
bin Flbnn is less important In persons with 
complete lack of fibrinogen m the blood 


bleeding Is controlled more readily than m 
those vath a defect, itv thrombin formation 
Inadequate hemostasis therefore may be 
due to a defect in the mechanism of reflex 
vasoconstnction increased permeability of 
capiUanes lack of vasoconstnetor sub 
stance hypinosis (decreased fibnnogen)

HEMORRHAGIC DISORDERS DUE TO ABNORMALITl OF 
THE BLOOD VESSELS AND TISSUES 
(NONTHROMBOCYTOGENIC PURPURAS) 


This group of hemorrhagic disorders 
(Table 6-2) is characterized by a local or 
generalized bleeding tendency chiefly in 
\olving skin or mucous membranes or both 
It IS not accompanied by a quantitative 
platelet deficiency or a demonstrable defect 
of plasma clottmg factors No attempt has 
been made m this classification to dis 
tinguish betsveen vascular and tissue fac 
tors since their respective share m the 
pathogenesis of a bleeding diatbesw caiawA 
be clearly defined at our present state of 
knowledge The rouune and tradiUonal tests 


for systemic vascular integnty namely the 
bleeding time and tourniquet test are nor 
mal with infrequent exceptions (Table 
6-2) The classic separation of the non 
thrombopenic from the thrombopemc pur 
puras is not nearly so clearcut as might 
appear on the surface Some of the gen 
eralized vascular disorders bsted such as 
scurvy and anaphylactoid purpura have 
on occasion been found associated with a 
numeivcal platelet de&eieney and tbe pos 
sibibty of a functional platelet defect

ACQUIRED DISORDERS 

Sfcojufnr) or Sjmjjlomnhc Umniltir Piir/mm 

Spontaneous purpura and bleeding into 
the skin or mucous membranes are roam 
festations of a large \anety of systemic dis- 
eases especially infections intoxications 
nutntional deficiencies and other metabobc 
disorders Although the noxious agent alone 
may cause \ascular damage its combina 
tion ^\^th a reduction in the number of 
platelets and wth an alteration in plasma 
clotting factors may be more common than 
IS currently realized This may also be true 
of concomitant impairment of platelet func 
tion (thrombasthema) 

Certain infections are particularly prone 
to be associated wth hemorrhagic skin 
lesions In infectious mononucleosis pete 
chiae often appear on the palate early in the 
disease In smallpox measles and scarlet 
fever the eruption may become hemor 
rhagic in typhus and other ncketisial dis 
cases the purpunc eruption Is caused by 
direct involvement of capillaries b> the 
causative agent In subacute bacterial endo- 
carditis rocnmgococcemia and other sep- 


ticemias, petechiae may, at least in part, 
be due to septic emboli (white center of the 
lesion) 

The purpura and bleeding tendency of 
uremia have for a long time been blamed on 
vascular damage recently a defect in 
platelet function has been shown to be a 
common finding Similarly, in scurv 7 the 
bleeding manifestations have been at 
tnbuted to a defect in the “cement" sub- 
stance of the vascular (capillary) wall and 
to ensuing mcreased permeability although 
occasionid thrombocytopenia has been ob- 
served The recent discovery of platelet 
factor 3 deficiency in a case of scurvy, 
promptly responding to treatment with 
vatamin C, suggests this as an alternate or 
additional medianism 

The use of numerous chemicals and 
drugs such as iodine phenobarbital, isonia 
ad and salicylates, has been associated 
with purpunc eruptions To what extent a 
platelet or plasma factor defect may occur 
In these capillary bleeding states cannot be 
clearly determined from the literature 
Tbrombocyiopenia is a frequent mamfesta 
tion of reactions to certain drugs especially 
quinine and Sedormid

Laboratorv Diagnosis o 

The tourniquet test may be found positive in 
setnle purpura and in acquired simple purpura just 
as in (he congenitat or familial disorder mentioned 
prcMOUsIy but the bleeding time is usually normal 
This laboratory pattern is also encountered in ana 
phylactoid purpura while In the fulminant disease 
both tests may be positive 

Senile purpura occurring almost exclusively In 
women is attributed to reduced elasticity of tissue 
resulting from degeneration of collagen Abrils Most 
lesions are conAned to the dorsal and radial surfaces 
of the forearm and hand In the absence of a com 
plicatlng vitamin C deficiency or blood disease this 
hemorrhagic diathesis illustrates the protective func 
tion of the perivascular tissue somewhat analogous 
to the congenita! syndrome of cutis laxa 

The acquired form of purpura simplex denotes a 
tendency to easy bruising and to developing petechial 
lesions in adults chiefly women over a period of 
many years not manifestly associated with active 
or preceding Infection or oUict conceivably Incjting 
noxious agent and usually not interfering seriously

(Detennwation of Ittereased FragiUty or 
Decreased 7?cji5/rt»ce of Capillaries) 

^ Toubniquet Test 

’^Principle By partially obstructing \enous 
blood floYV of the arm the intracapillary 
pressure is increased and may give nse to 
extravasation of blood in the form of pete- 
chiae With standardized pressure and lime 
of application the number of petechlae re- 
flects the degree of increased capillary 
fragiUly 

Equipment Sphygmomanometer stetho- 
scope 

■y Procedure A (Quick 1957) With the blood 
pressure cuff apphed to the upper arm a 
pressure midway between systolic and dia 
stollc levels is maintained for five minutes 
Fifteen minutes after release of the inflated 
cuff petechlae are counted within a clrcu 
lar area 5 cm In diameter )ust below the 
elbow pit A count greater than fiv e is ab- 
normal and denotes increased capillary 
fragility 

Procedure B (Gothhn 1933) The blood 
pressure cuff is apphed to the upper arm and 
inflated to provide a pressure of 35 mm 
llg for 15 mmutes Upon release the pete 
chiae are counted with a magnif>ing lens 
within a circular area 6 cm in diameter 
In or just below the elbow pit One hour 
after rdease of the cuff the procedure is re- 
peated with a pressure of 50 mm Hg and 


the number of newly formed petechlae Is 
added to the double count of the first test 
Normal range 8 to 12 potecliiae 

SucTio'i Test 

Principle Appbcation of negative pres 
sure of suflicicni degree to the skin and 
indirectly to extrav ascular tissues causes 
extravasauon of blood the extent of which 
provides a measure of capillary permea 
bility 

A 2 cm diameter suction cup 's applied 
for one minute The normal capillary re- 
sistance as measured on the exterior sur 
face of the upper arm at the level of the 
base of llie heart ranges between 200 and 
250 mm Hg and the average normal value 
in the supraclavicular fossa is between liO 
and 180 mm Hg 

Equipment ’"Petechiometcr "• consisting 
of a plastic suction cup 2 cm In diameter 
cormecYed vatiY a harrei which houses a 
piston and springs (Fig 6-2) 

Procedure The lips of the cup are lubri 
cated and held ftrml> to tlie midportion of 
the upper arm (hairless area) in close con 
tact with the skin Graded release of the 
plunger after It has first been pushed Ih 
all the wa> provides a negative pressure of 
JOO 200 or 300 mm Hg Suction is re- 
leased after one minute and petechbo 
within a circle 1 cm In diameter (plastic 
disk) arc counted five minutes later 
Normal range 0 to 2 petechlae at 200 mm 
Hg (medium position of plunger)

Dukes Method (1910) 
'^Equipment (Stenie) Spnng Lancet (or 
Bard Parker blade No 11) or preferably a 
sterile, disposable, commercially available 
blood lancet, filter paper (small circular 
sheets), microscope slides 

Procedure While a sbde is held behind 
and m close contact wth the ear lobe, the 
latter is pierced Yvith the spring lancet ad 
justed to 2 mm of cutting depth (tvith use 
of the blade or disposable lancet, the ear lobe 
must be stabbed trough ivith a single hard 
stroke for fairly comparable results) Every 
half minute thereafter, a fresh spot of filler 
paper is appbed to the ound until the bleed 
ing has stopped and no longer causes the 
paper to be stained Normal range mo to

Ivy’s Method (1935) 

Equipment Same as in the Duke method, 
plus a sphygmomanometer 

Procedure The same manipulation out* 
lined for the Duke method is followed but 
applied to the inner aspect of the forearm 
(just distal to the antecubital pit) during 
application of a blood pressure cuff to the 
upper arm, inflated to 40 mm Hg The in 
ciston should be 2 mm in length and depth

method plus phjsiologic saline at 37“ C and 
a hemoglobinometcr A disposable lancet or 
Bard Parker blade No 1 1 is anchored in a 
cork stopper with tip of blade projecting 
exactly 4 mm 

Procedure The duration of bleeding 
caused by puncture of the hypothenar while 
the blood pressure cuff compresses the upper 
arm at 40 mm Hg as uell as tho amount 
of blood lost during this period, is measured 
and, m addition, the skin temperature is 
controlled Upon inflicting the stab wound 
and starting the stopwatch, the hand 
previously dipped in the warm salt solution 
for three minutes and dried is reintroduced 
into (he bath, and oozing of blood is ob- 
served until it ceases (= bleeding time) 
The volume of blood lost is derived from 
measurement of hemoglobin in both the 
patients blood (H) and the saline bath (h),

HEMORRHAGIC DISORDERS DUE TO INTRAVASCULAR 
FACTORS (DEFECTS IN COAGULATION) 

CELLS 


Platelets 

Platelets play a central role in the hemo- 
static mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 
6-1 They were not included in Morawltz's 
original scheme, since their thromboplastic 
funcuon was not recognized until 1912 
(Bordet and Delange) Subsequently plate- 
lets were regarded as a source of ihrombo- 
plasim when blood clotted in the absence 
of contamination with tissue juice How 
ever, platelets will not reduce the clotting 


time of rccalofied platelet poor plasma to 
less than 60 to 80 seconds (Biggs and Mac- 
farlane, 1957), by comparison, the clotting 
time IS reduced to 12 seconds or less when 
a potent tissue extract (Table G-1) or “m 
tnnsic~ thromboplastin is added 

The function of platelets in the coagula- 
tion process can be readily demonstrated 
with blood collected and centrifuged at high 
speed in the cold without exposing it to a 
^ass surface The resulting platelet poor

longed plasma recalcificauon time and, with 
se\ere platelet deficiency, also a prolonged 
whole blood clotting time, furthermore, the 
prothrombm consumption of such blood 
is marVedlj reduced (see p 357) All these 
clotDng times can be “corrected by adding 
normal platelets In addition to their role m 
coagulation, platelets have at least two other 
biologic functions clot retraction and 
vascular hemostasis 

Although the purpose of clot retraction 
not clear it depends upon the presence of 
platelets as mtact cellular elements and ap- 
parently is dlstmct from their clot promot 
mg chemical action The latter may be sub 
stantially reduced in some thrombasthemc 
states (Yvithout a numerical decrease) while 
retraction may proceed normally and vice 
versa The degree of rmpairmem. o£ retrac 
tion in thrombocytopema is roughly propor 
tional to the depression m the number of 
platelets especially vvith counts below 
100 000 per cu mm At least two other 
factors influence retracoon, namelj. the 
fibrinogen concentrauon and the blo^ cell 
mass (hematocnt) although m mterse 
proportions The higher the number of red 
cells (eg, in polycythemia) or the fibnn 
ogen level the less the degree of retracuon 
The influence of platelets upon vascular 
function can be documented on the basis 
of at least four empirical facts Thrombo- 
cytopenia IS usually associated uith pur 
pura the contraction of nail bed capillaries 
which can normall) be eUcited bj pinpncK 
or other direct irritation is deficient in 
thrombocytopenia platelets accumulate at 
sites of mmute mjury to small blood vessels 
and skin wounds are prone to bleed longer 
and more profuscl) in patients with plaldet 
defects 

Accordingly tests for platelet function 
may be classified as follows 
Tests of coagulation 

Prothrombin consumption (p 357) 
Thromboplastin generation test (p 
358) 

Plasma clotting tune (without and with 
added hepann) (p 347) 

Whole blood clotting lime (abnormal 
only in severe platelet deficlenc>) 
(P 345) 

Tests for clot retracUon 

Quahtativ e test for presence or absence 
of retraction (see below) 

Elstimation of degree of retraction of 
of retraction lime (p 33^) 

Tests for vascular integntj 

Capillar} fragility or permcabibty 
tourniquet test (and its various 


modifications) and suction test (p 
328) 

Capillary contractility bleeding time 
(P 328) 

Morphologic observations of capil 
lanes in nail bed, conjunctiv ae, and 
other areas 

In addition to enumerauon of platelets, 
evaluation of their size, shape, and struc 
ture, and study of their precursors in the 
marrow, the megakaryocytes, these tests 
represent the current scope of routine 
laboratory studies pertammg to platelets 
The three main functions of platelets ma>

ocularly true with regard to vascular con

15 000 platelets per cu mm may show 
relatively little purpura, while another with 
a considerably higher platelet count and 
without other demonstrable clotting defect 
may show widespread blcedmg into the skin 
and other organs Similarly, splenectomv in 
a pauenl with thrombopemc purpura may

V^ESTS FOR Clot Retbactiom 
Principle This term refers to the spon 
taneous contraction of the blood clot and 
the associated separation of transparent 
serum Both the timed diminution in the 
size of the clot (from the initial size) and 
the volume of serum as well as the time re 
quircd for these effects maj serve as 
measures of retraction

without special attention to contamination 
\vith tissue fluid) is placed in the tube and, 
after clotting, incubated at 37® C. for one 
hour. Reduction in tlie size of the dot or 
the appearance of serum between the clot 
and the wall of the tube signifies that re- 
traction has occurred and may provide a 
rough estimate of the degree of retraction. 

By pouring off the serum and measuring 
its volume, approxiate quantitation is pos- 
sible: Clot retraction (in per cent) equals 
milliliters of senun x 50. Tliis computation 
applies if the volume of venous blood tested 
is 2 ml. Othenvise dot retracUon (in per

20 to 65 per cent. 

When native, platelet-rich plasma is used 
instead of whole blood, the influence of the 
red cell mass on retraction is eliminated, 
making the result a more direct and depend- 
able measure of platelet function. With 1 
ml. of plasma, clot retraction (in per cent) 
equals milliliters of serum X 100. Normal 
Tange: 40 to 70 per cent.

Platelet Factors 

In vitro analysis of platelets and correla 
tion wth climcal deficiency states has re- 
sulted in descnption of a number of platelet 
clotting factors designated by Arabic nu 
merals for differentiation from plasma 
factors (Table 6-3) Some of the clotting 
properties of platelets as well as many other 
substances contained in these tiny cell frag 
ments were soon found to be “extrinsic 
baggage ” i e adsorbed and earned along by 
platelets but not contnbuting essentially to 
specific platelet function Included among 
these presumablj extrinsic platelet con 
stituents are not only many of the plasma 
clotting factors such as fibrinogen factors 
V and Vin and others (Table 6-4) but 
also albumin enzymes and hormones Of 
the latter category serotonm shows a com 
paratl^el> high concentration m platelets 
under normal condiaons but the only role 
this substance seems to pla> m the total 
clotting process concerns perhaps the 
imtiation of fibnnoljsis Of the eight factors 
that ha>e been described separately (listed 
in Table 6-3) onl> four are now considered 
to represent mtnnsic cellular properties 
Of these retractozym is probably the most 
speculame substance since no extract of 
platelets has thus far been found to be 
capable of replacing active and intact throm 
bocytes m ebcitmg clot retraction In spite 
of the designation there is no evidence that 
a smgle enzyme is responsible for this 
process (see footnote Table 6-3) 

Much experimental work is ciirrenlly devoted to 
the analysis of the thromboplastic function Cpiatelet 
factor 3) The factor is contained m crude phos 
pholipid rich extracts of platelets Of the various 
chromato^aphjcally identihable fractions of this 
extract which include ethanol senne and inositol 
phosphatide lecithin and sphingoin>eUn the first 
three mentioned have been shown to successfully 
replace platelets in various tests such as thrombo- 
plastin generation and prothrombin consumpboa 
Extracts of bram egg yolk and soybean have been 
found to have very similar acbvity

Bcure than that of the idiopathic form 
Moreover, an immune mechanism accounts 
for the platelet deficiency not only in many 
cases that conform clinically to the idio- 
pathic type but undoubtedly also In mani- 
festly s)mptomatic cases (drug h>Tperscnsi 
tivii), acute infections) 

The incidence of an ttnnutne mechanism 
responsible for thrombocytopenic purpura 
cannot be estimated reliably because of 
analytical technical difficulties, ivhich seri- 
ously interfere with the accuracy and repro- 
ducibility of results and therefore with 
acceptance of such procedures Were n not 
for these difnculilcs, division between the 
immune and nonimmunc types of thrombo 
cjtopathlcs might be more logical than the 
present tabulation Perhaps the most reason- 
able principle to follow in classifying plate- 
let disorders would be that employed with 
resiKct to red blood cells, namely, the 
analysis of an existing (numerical or quali 
taiive) abnormality of platelets In blood on 
the basis of •production (bone marrow), 
destruction or utilization, and loss from the 
body increased or decreased tUromhocy 
taiioiesis, increased throtrthcajtolffsis or 
ihromboagglutlnatlon (thrombosis), and 
hemorrhaoc A quantitative or qualitative 
deficiency may conceivably be central Jn 
origin, i e , caused by a marrow defect, or 
secondary to damage incurred in the periph- 
eral vascular system (analogous, for ex- 
ample, to autoimmune hemolytic anemia) 

Although such a breakdown into etlologic 
factors of a positive or negative nature may 
well be attempted, practical laboratory tech 
niques arc not available to apply this 
principle for routine diagnostic purposes 
There Is no procedure knoirn that ivould 
enable one to identify or measure structural 
or chemical derivatives of platelet break- 
down, as in the case of blood cells 
Furthermore, the very nature of the plate- 
lets — their stickiness and tendency to readily 
lyse or clump — interferes with in titro ob- 
servations of morphologic or serologic quali- 
ties and of deviations from the normal 

As another means of classifying thrombocyftv 
pemas, a distinction between avtcgcikaiyocyilc and 
mejjatnriyoei/lfc formshas been advocated {Stefanini 
and Dameshek, 1955) Study of bone tnanw Is Jn 
deed desirable In every case of platelet deficiency, 
bm It does not necessarily furnish a satisfactory 
etlologic clue Thus, a reduction in the number or 
megakaryocytes has been observed in patients diag 
nosed as having idiopathic thrombocytopenic pur 
puia (ITP) even though, in this condition, the 
marrow commonly shows a normal or Increased 
number of these precursors of platelets It may well 
be that a circulating antfplatclet agent not only 
causes accelerated removal of platelets and Rrorpho- 


logic alteration (arrest of maturation) of mega 
karyocytes but may even shorten their life span and 
Interfere with their reproduction 

That the spleen may play an important etiologic 
role In platelet disorders has been known since 1916 
when Kazncison used splenectomy successfully to 
treat a patient suffering from thrombocytopenia A 
hyperacthe spleen (hypersplenism) may not only 
cause direct destruction of platelets in excessive 
amounts but apparently may also inhibit release of 
platelets from the marrow, contribute to the produc 
tion of platelet agglutinating and lytic (’immune) 
factors, and adversely affect the integrity of the vas 
cularendothclium Although the exact mechanism of 
splenic action upon platelets and other blood cells 
especially its humoral ospccts are far from clear 
distinction of hygcTspleme from nonhypcrspienic 
ihromtiopaihfes would be of practical therapeutic 
value However, In many instances of the disease 
such distinction is a complex task requiring careful 
clinical judgment and can, at present, be substan 
tlated in retrospect only by splenectomy 

Correlation of the presence of an immune media 
nism (If it can be estimated reliably) and hyper 
splenism has been shown to be dose, but many ex 
ccptlons occur, i e , some patients with proved cir 
culating platelet agglutinins are not improved by 
splenectomy The size of the spleen is no better index 
of splenic function Improvement often foUons re- 
moval of a normal-size or slightly enlarged spleen in 
ITP. but extirpation of a large spleen in lymphoma 
or leukemia may not help Hence, classification of 
thrombopenias on the basis of the size of the spleen 
(as determined by x ray or palpation) is useful in 
bedside diagnosis but does not coincide with patho- 
genic grouping 

Classification of platelet disorders may be at 
tempted on the basis of structural alteration of 
platelets Variations In size, pseudopod formation, 
granularity, proportion of chromomerc to hyalomere, 
and other features have been associated with spe- 
cific functional changes and disease entities For 
adequate resolution of structural details, phase and 
electron microscopy is required Results of current 
investigations in this field must be awaited with 
much interest, they do not serve practical dtagnos 
tic purposes at present

Conf'emtal thrombocytopenia Reduc 
Uon or absence of platelets in the newborn 
may be the result of at least five factors 

1 A platelet antibody transmitted from 
the mother through the placenta may cause 
transitory thrombocytopenia Occasionally 
the mother may show no clinical evidence 
of thrombocytopema 

2 In erythroblastosis fetalis diminution 
of platelets is a common finding due largel} 
either to antibody formation against plate 
lets as well as against red cells or to hyper 
splemsm in addition perhaps to hepatic 
dysfunction and to other not clearly recog 
mzed factors 

3 Congemtal absence or reduction of 
megakaryocytes may occur with or rarely 
without deficiency of myeloid and erythroid 
elements in the bone marrow (congemtal 
hypoplastic anemia) and may on occasion 
be associated with other abnormahoes e g 
in the Fancom syndrome 

This hereditary disorder which was first 
desenbed m 1926 consists of pancytopenia 
hypoplasia of the marrow and other often 
multiple congenital anomalies such as 
patchy brown pigmentation of skin dwarf 
ism microcephaly hypogenitalism strabis 
mus digital and renal malformations and 
mental retardauon The syndrome is trans- 
mitted by an autosomal recessive gene with 
variable penetrance and usually occurs in 
siblings (Hsia 1959) 

In contrast to these hypomegakaryocytic 
cases a syndrome of purpura bloody diar 
rhea eczematoid dermatitis and recurrent 
ear infection has been desenbed associated 
with a marrow rich in megakaryocytes but 
with hide evidence of platelet formation 
The syndrome seems to occur in males only 
and to be transmitted by a sex linked re 
cessue gene (Ratnoff 1958)

bocytopenia is giant hemangioma which 
apparently results in sequestration of plate- 
lets in the neoplasm Removal of the heman

diseases involving the bone marrotv or the 
spleen or botl}. Elaborate listings of indi- 
vidual drugs and toxins have been pub- 
lished (Mlalc, 1958; Wintrobe. 1961). 

Acute or severe infections, such as the 
acute tiral exanthemas of childhood, may 
cause a decrease in platelets, presumably 
both by action upon circulating platelets 
and by depression of the marrow. The de- 
structive action upon platelets probably in- 
volves aniibotly production, in addition, per- 
haps. to a nonspecific clumping agent, such 
as can be observed in peptone and anaphy- 
lactic shock (Quick, 1957). There is no cor- 
rciatfon between the severity of the ifirom- 
bocyiojjcnia or purpura and the severity of 
the infection. At times, the infection 
(mumps, measles) may be so mild as to be 
completely overlooked so that the thrombo- 
cytopenia Is designated as “idiopathic.’' 
Most cases of acute ITP probably should lie 
attributed to an infectious process and 
others to hj^persensltivliy reactions to other 
types of noxious agents, particularly drugs. 

N^'hvn splenomegaly Is a distinct feature 
of the disease, the possibility of a hyper- 
splenic mechanism’s causing or contributing 
to the thrombocytopenia must be considered, 
especially in the case of chronic infections, 
such as hematogenous tuberculosis or histo- 
plasmosis. Many drugs and other chemicals 
produce thrombocytopenia by means of a 
similar Immune mechanism, which, in at 
least some instances. Involves the forma- 
tion of certain antibc^ies. Agglutination of 
normal platelets by the patient's scrum can 
be demonstrated only if a .solution of the 
noxious substance, such as quinine or 
Scdormld, is added to the test tube. A direct 
toxic effect upon the bone marrow undoubt- 
edly results from e.vposure to ccrt.itn chemi- 
cals, such as benzene, DDT, and nitrogen 
mustards. A similar effect on circulating 
platelets has been ascribed to other agents, 
especially ristocetin (Gangarosa et at., 
1900). 

Physical agents such as excessive heat 
(heat stroke), and particularly Ionizing radi- 
ation, depress platelets primarily or entirely 
by Inliibition of bone marrow function. This 
is also true, as a rule, of leukemia and mye- 
lophthisic processes. Inhibition cannot be 
attributed entirely to invasion of the mar- 
row and replacement by foreign tissue but 
to a metabolic-enzymatic derangement as 
well. It is not unusual to find a relativdy 


small portion of marrow (occasionally 
none) replaced by tumor tissue but accom- 
panied by significant depression of platelets. 
Thrombasthenia is a common feature in 
leukemia with or without thrombocytopienia. 
The presence of platelet antibody compli- 
cating these diseases cannot be excluded, 
and in some instances a hypersplemc 
mechanism has been suggested by a per- 
sistent rise in platelets after splenectomy. 
This mechanism must be considered espe- 
cially when associated with depression of 
red and white cells in any instance of splen- 
omegaly, whether due to chronic infection 
(kala-azar. tuberculosis), granulomatous 
disease (sarcoidosis), portal vein throm- 
bosis. Gaucher’s disease, rheumatoid arthri- 
tis. cirrhosis, or other splenomegahc dis- 
orders 

Hypersplenism may be a feature of sys- 
temic lupus erythematosus, but since splen- 
ectomy may cause worsening of the course 
of the disease, other pathogenetic mecha- 
nisms must be considered (Rablnowitz and 
Dameshek. 19G0). Evidence of lupus has 
recently been found in cases previously diag- 
nosed as ITP, and the exact relation of 
these two diseases remains to be elucidated, 
as docs their fundamental nature. For the 
time being, one may assume that both 
diseases represent examples of hypersensi- 
tivity. the target in ITP being largely con- 
fined to the platelets and capillary endo- 
thefiaf system, whereas in disseminated 
lupus erythematosus it is extended to in- 
clude the entire hematopoietic and vascular 
structures 

Massive blood loss may cause a tempor- 
ary reduction in circulating platelets until 
the megakaryocytes succeed in compensat- 
ing for the deficiency. The relatively slight 
thrombocytopenia may be considerably ag- 
gravated by transfusion with platelet-poor 
blood. Even freshly drawn blood is platelet- 
poor if collected in uncoated glass bottles, 
because a “coagulant agglutinin” forms 
when blood comes in contact with a foreign 
surface, such as glass (Quick, 1957). The 
nonspecific platelet-agglutinating action of 
glass-bottled blood may cause a significant 
drop in the recipient’s platelets, even with- 
out preceding hemorrhage, and contribute 
to hemorrhagic complications This deple- 
tion of thrombocytes may be avoided by 
collecting and keeping blood or plasma for 
transfusion In sUlconized bottles or in 
plastic containers, 

The thrombocytopenia of a hemolytic 
transfusion reaction is, at least in part, due 
to agglutination or lysis of platelets, as well

as to thrombosis or hemagglutmation in 
capillaries This is also presumably part of 
the mechanism in sicUe cell crisis and 
especially m thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura 

The drop m platelets frequently seen in 
cirrhosis and at times in set ere cases of 
acute hepatitis has usually been attributed 
to a hypersplemc effect A possible direct 
action of the hver upon platelet production 
must be seriously considered analogous to 
the well known influence of hepatic disease 
upon erythro- and leukopoiesis (Watson et 
ai 1947) Similarly inhibition of the mar 
row in renal disease (uremia) may affect 
megakaryocytes with resulting depression 
of the number and quahty of the platelets 
The menstrual depression of the platelets 
as contrasted to their regular nse coincid 
mg with ovulation and the occasional cases 
of thrombocytopema precipitated or aggra 
vated fay pregnancy especially immediately 
precedmg parturition suggest a direct hor 
monal influence upon platelet formation 
presumably more complex than is inferred 
from the term ‘hyperestrogenosis (Qmck 
1957) 

It should be reemphasized that the num 
ber of platelets and the degree of purpura 
(or length of bleeding time) generally show 
poor correlation Some purpunc mamfesta 
tions usually occur mth counts below 100 
000 per cu mm but they may be pro- 
nounced wth concentrauons well aboie this 
le\el and minimal ivith a count of 50 000 
or less Distmct improiement in purpura 
and a shortenmg of the bleeding time often 
herald recovery from acute thrombocyto 
pemc purpura before a significant increase 
m the platelet count can be detected Sum 
larly the diffuse oozmg of blood from ab- 
dommal vessels at the time of splenectomy 
for ITP stops as soon as the splemc vessels 
are hgated while the number of circulatmg 
platelets does not mcrease until hours later 
Finally ACTH and cortisone frequently 
hai e a beneficial effect upon bleedmg tend 
ency and distinctly shorten the bleeding 
time without altering substantially the plate 
let count Hence the existence of a circu 
lating vasotropic substance may be as

Laboratori Methods 

cenUy considered to be restricted to con 
gemtal disorders Tuo syndromes were 
recognized hereditary hemorrhagic throm 
basthema (GlanzmannNaegeU) and consti 
tutional thrombopathy (Von Willebrand 
Jurgens) The former was characterized by 
deficient clot retraction as the only abnor 
mahty of blood (with a normal bleeding 
time) and the latter by a prolonged bleed 
ing time but normal clot retraction In both 
groups of patients the purpunc type of 
bleeding was observed \«th superficial 
hemorrhages into the skin oozing from 
mucous membranes easy bruising and ex 
cessive bleeding from small cuts and abra 
sions 

Subsequent observers attempted to char 
actenze these two groups of nonthiombo- 
pemc purpura” more clearlj Laboratory 
cntena of the Glanzmann t>pe m addition 
to deficient clot retraction were stated to 
include increased capillary fragihty (posi 
tive tourniquet test) and decreased ad 
hesneness but normal size of the platelets 
and normal prothrombin consumption (wth 
a normal or prolonged bleeding time) 
Hereditary transmission was suggested to 
be recessive — autosomal in character The 
Willebrand Jurgens variety presumed to be 
transmitted by a dominant gene was 
described as showing normal clot retraction 
but prolonged bleeding time increased 
capillary fragility and abnormal prothrom 
bin consumption and thromboplastm gen 
eration frequently m association with giant 
size platelets (Table 6-3) 

The large body of hterature that has ac 
cumulated on this subject m recent years 
IS somewhat confusing because of discrep- 
ancies in terminology incomplete reportmg 
of laboratory results and differences m lab- 
oratory techniques It has however become 
apparent that the classification just cited is 
aruficial and ought to be abandoned Von 
Willebrand s name has been associated with 
at least three types of hemostatic disorders 
(see p 325) of which only one includes a 
platelet defect (with prolonged bleeding 
time and deficiency of platelet factor 3 but 
with normal clot retraction) 

The other two types are pseudohemopluba 
A considered to represent a purel> vascular 
anomaly (proposed to be a blending of 
Osiers and Von Willebrand 5 disease “sjs 
temic capillary telangiectasia”) and vascu 
lar hemophilia (pseudohemophilia B ) The 
latter type denotes a combination of a cap- 
illary defect (prolonged bleeding time) with 
a decrease in factor VIII (or occasionally 
other plasma factors) (Table 6-6) 



Laboratory Diagnosis of Hemorrhacic Disorders 


Acquired EMdcnce is rapidly accumu 
Hung that a funcuonal platelet defect is a 
common complication of a sarietj of s>s 
temic diseases It appears that thrombas 
thenia may complicate thrombocytopenia of 
eilher tlie idiopathic or symptomatic Narlety 
and that it may occur In the presence of a 
normal and even a substantiallj increased 
platelet count Much credit for this discov 
cr> should probibl> go to the thromhoplas 
tin generation test 

Aside from the pnmanly thrombocyto 
pcnic disorders conditions that haYC been 
associated lYith thrombasthenia include 
renal lusufTicicnctj cirrhosis of the liver, 
nutritional dcficicncj sucli as scurfy and 
blood dyscrasias of various tjpes especially 
leukemia Tlic qualitative defect may be 
demonstrated b> only one of several tests or 
It may involve all demonstrable platelet 
functions Because of its frequent assocla

cicnc> Involving capillary permcabilitj or 
plasma factors or both recognition of 
thrombasthema may be diHicult and de- 
pends on careful performance of the throm 
boplasiin generation test To what extent 
thrombasthenia maj be responsible for an 
existing bleeding tendency or be the pre 
cursor of bleeding may depend on tbc do 
gree of deviation from the normal as shown 
by the tests cmplojed ic (he degree of 
prolongation of the bleeding time or clotting 
time in the thromboplastin generation test 
the platelet suspension being the only re 
agent derived from the patient Thrombas

with clinical improvement it may be 
marked at the time of gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage from the esophageal v antes 
of a patient with hepauc cirrhosis and be 
absent two weeks after bleeding has 
stopped when he appears to be recovenng 
Since massive blood loss alone may be 
followed by transient thromboc>topenla or 
thrombasthenia the exact causal relation 
ship in such cases is not clear and requires 
further stud> 

Throm boc) lovis and Thrombocytliemia 
Increased acuvity of the bone marrow often 
includes accelerated proliferation of mega 
kan/ocytes and thrombocytosis i e a nse 
in the number of arculating platelets above 
the normal range This occurs regularly fol 
lowing fractures especially of Uie neck of 
the femur, and in other types of trcHma 
mcluding surgical operations the maximal 
increase occurring between the seventh and 
twentieth postoperauve days Splenectomy 
is followed by a more immediate and greater 


increase than other operations Acute rheu 
matic finer, suppurative infections asphyxi 
ation and acute hemorrhage may result in 
thrombocytosis, while chronic blood loss or 
massive gastrointestinal bleeding may be 
associated with a reduction in the platelet 
count followed by an increase Aside from 
these acute reactive forms more persistent 
thrombocytosis is encountered in myelopro- 
liferatiie diseases, especially in chrome 
granulocj tic leukemia erythremia and mye- 
lofibrosis It has also been observed m Hodg 
I ills disease metastatic carcinoma and 
hyperadrenabsm and m functional or struc 
lural hyposplemsm such as splenic vem 
thrombosis splenic atrophy and the post 
splenectomy state Venous thrombosis in 
some of the conditions mentioned may at 
least m pan be a result of the rise m 
circulating platelets During the posiopera 
live period after splenectomy venous and 
arterial occlusions by thrombi arc frequent 
complications 

Wicn cxcessne proliferation of mega 
karyocytes is sustained resulting in an ele 
vation of the platelet count to one or sev 
oral millions cubic millimeter of blood 
the term ihrombocytlieinta is applied ana 
logous to leukemia and polycythemia First 
described by di Guglielmo m 1920 under the 
name of piastrincmia it is a rare myelo- 
proliferative disorder bmlted to the mega 
karyocytes and their products the platelets 
The spleen often greatly enlarged may 
show distention of the cords by thrombo* 
cytic masses m addition to extramedullary 
hematopoiesis confined to megakaryocytic 
foci Thus this organ fulfills the important 
job of removing platelets from the circula 
tion opposing the excessive productivity of 
the megakaryocytes removal of the spleen 
is contraindicated and may be followed by 
serious vascular occlusive complications 
Irrespective of splenectomy thrombocy 
thcmia may be associated with Uie contrast 
ing aspects of both hemorrhagic diathesis 
and thrombosis The former may follow the 
pattern of thrombocytopenia but at times 
may also include some hemophilloid fea 
tures eg, deep muscle hematomas and 
hemarthroses These complications may 
perhaps be attributed to thrombosis and 
secondary vascular injury resulting from 
the high platelet count 

Consequently the hemorrhagic tendency 
IS likely to be at least twofold defect in 
platelet or plasma factors and ischemia and 
vascular injury consequent to capillary 
thrombosis The latter feature is to some 
extent, analogous to observations in sickle

cell anemia and in the platelet thrombosis 
syndrome (thrombotic thrombocytoperac 
purpura ) 

Red Blood Cells 

Although red blood cells are known to 
contain a potent thromboplastic agent that 
IS comparable m action to platelet factor 
3, It IS not certain to what extent, if any. 
this plays a role in normal hemostasis (Fig 
6-1 ) Posthemorrhagic anemia is frequently 
associated with an increase in platelets, 
whereas anemia due to various blood dys- 
crasias is associated wth a decrease A 
marked nse in red cells (primary or sec- 
ondary polycythemia) or abnormal shape 
(sickle cell anemia) enhances the viscosity 
of the blood This may cause occlusion of 
small blood \essels by slowing down of the 
circulation and mechanical plugging 
Thrombosis of capillaries and of precapd 
lary vessels may lead to ischemic necrosis 
of the \essel wall and of surrounding tissue 
and, secondarily, to bleeding Associated 
hemostatic defects frequently encountered 
m erythremia include an increase m plate 
lets and a decrease in fibrinogen 

IVliite Blood Cells 

Leukocytes per se are ordinarily not con 
sidered to play a role in hemostasis Protco- 
l}tjc ferments of leukocytes trapped in a 
thrombus may contribute considerably to 
Its dissolution A marked nse in white cells, 
such as occurs in leukemia, Increases the 
viscosity of the blood and may lead to 
vascular obstruction and ischemic necrosis 
as well as to hemorrhagic manifestations, 
much the same as polycythemia or slckhng 
Both platelets and plasma clotting fac 
tors are frequently deranged in leukemia 
Moderate thrombocytosis is common in the 
chrome granulocytic form, while pro- 
nounced thrombocytopenia Is the rule in 
acute leukemia, in either instance, func- 
tional abnormality of the platelets may be 
an important causathc factor in bleeding 
Of the plasma clotting factors members of 
the prothrombin complex (eg. factors V, 
VII, and X) are most frequently deficient 
Abnormal circulating anucoagulants and 
Increased fibnnol>sis may also occur 

rL.\SMA FACTORS (IIEMOPHILIOID 
DISORDERS OR COAGULOPATfllES) 

The Coagulation Mechanism. Primary 


hemostasis, i e , cessation of bleeding from 
injured blood vessels, is the result of func- 
tional integnty of the vascular wall, of the 
platelets, and presumably of tissue throm 
boplastm Secondary hemostasis or the seal- 
mg of the gap and formation of a fibrin 
clot depend upon interaction between plate- 
lets and plasma factors The end product 
of this interaction Is a proteolytic enzyme, 
thrombin, which converts the dissolved 
fibrinogen into solid fibrin This conversion 
of fibrinogen, consisting essentially of split- 
ting “fibnnopeptldes” from the fibnnogen 
molecules, which then join to form interlac- 
ing fibnn strands, is very rapid, under opti- 
mal conditions and concentrations of the 
reactants, it may take as httle as one 
second Calcium ions are not required for 
this conversion process to take place, but 
their presence m physiologic concentrations 
accelerates the effect of thrombin and in- 
creases the mechamcal strength of the 
fibnn clot In addition, a specific accelerator 
substance contained m plasma has been 
postulated 

Except for any deficiency of fibrinogen, 
an interference with its conversion, or a 
lytic influence upon fibnn. any disturbance 
of the coagulation process must be reflected 
in the end product of the enzymatic chain 
reaction, thxombm This key substance is 
formed from its precursor, prothrombin, by 
the spbtting of a prosthetic group from the 
latter through the proteolytic (’) action of 
thromboplastm In a wider sense, the term 
“thromboplastm" may be apphed to any 
substance that accelerates the clotting of 
rccalcified plasma Although tissue throm 
boplastin is present in practically all body 
ceUs (except blood cells) and presumabl> 
contributes to pnmary hemostasis at the 
site of vascular injury, it ordinanly does 
not enter the circulation except under un 
usual circumstances, c g , abruptio jila 
centae Tissue thromboplastin requires for 
its full activation the plasma “accelerator 
factors,” namely, factors V, VII. and X They 
are also called “accessory factors ’ Together 
with factor II, they form the “prothrombin 
complex ” Formation of a blood borne, pro- 
thrombin-converting principle or intrinsic 
thromboplastin (also called "prothrombin 
ase ' ) occurs as a result of the interaction 
of platelet factor 3 witli all the known 
plasma clotting factors numbered from D' 
on up, except for factor VII (Tables (M 
6-6, Fig 6-4) 

The initiation of thl» chain reaction, 1 e , wha* 
causes the plasma factors to “interact." is a ques-

tlon that touches upon tho fundamental problem 
at the mechanism that permits ilood to remain 
liq lid in circulation while retaining the potential ty 
of soIidif)ing at any time According to Quick 
maintenance of the fluid ty of blood is probatly due 
in part to the nature of the endothelial lining of blood 
vessels and partly to the stability and nonreactivity 
of the circulating clotting factors Clotting Is usually 
initiated by the escape of tissue thromboplastin into 
the blood at the site of injury to a blood vessel This 
thromboplastin with the aid of the accelerator fac 
tors promptly liberates thrombin from } rotbrcmtnn 
Thrombin not only conseris fbnnogcn into fibrin 
but also activates a postulated plasma factor pre 
phase accejerator or PPA • which in turn “labillics 
platelets These agglutinate forn ing a white 
thrombus and at (he same time release their factor 
3 piastnn The latter Interacts with the various 
plasma factors to form intrinsic thrombopl'istin 
Ti e result is further production of thrombin (auio- 
catalytlc cycle) 

This hypothesis obviously leaves unanswered the 
question of what activates plasma factors since 
platelet factor 3 apparently does not have this prop 
ert) Intravenous injection of a potent platelet ex 
tract into rabbits does not cause demonstrable in 
Iravaseular clotting Moreover extravascular (tis 
sue) thromboplastin would seem to be a prerequisite 
for clot formation even though blood carefully col 
lectcd in a test tube without admixture of tissue 
ju ce (tweMytinge tccl mque) Is able to clot The 
suggestion (hat a clotting factor contained In red 
bl 0 (^ cells which wasrecentlydiscoieredandshown 
to have platelet factor 3 like activity 1 1 vitro may 
have the physiologic role of Initiating (be throm 
binogenie reaction remains to be substantiated 

Discovery of (he liageman factor has provided a 
supplcmentaty hypothesis attempting to fill (he vo d 
just mentioned Thus this factor may be activated 
(or Jls inhibitor Inactivated) I y endothelial Injury 
or by glass (or by some other adsorbent) giving in 
(urn the signal for the chain reaction that leads to 
formation of intrinsic thromboplastin and of throm 
bin (KatnofT 1958) 

A totally different view considers the tnainienance 
of fluidity of the blood to be the result of a constant 
interplay of positive and negative forces eg co- 

• A hypothetical substance whose existence re 
mains to be proved (iPisch and Ducisert 1959) 


agulant and inhibitory factors Tl e latter may play 
an Important role that is as yet not well understood 
Under normal conditio s the only physiologically 
important Inhibitor according to Quick is fibrin 
which acts as a potent antithrombin by adsorbing 
nascent thrombin thereby greatly limit ng the auto- 
catalytic action of thrombin Tlius wi cn thrombin 
production Js slight as udth minor injuries or in 
many hemonhag c disorders and is matched by 
the adsorbing capacity of available fihnn no free 
thrombin becomes available and the clotting process 
is quickly terminated at least until fihnn retracts 
and releases serum containing thrombin In freely 
circulating blood thrombin is removed as quickly 
as it is being released and is disposed of promptly 
In the presence of a slow or stagnant circular on 
and In si cd blood ev en small amounts of thromb n 
may eventuate in a large clot that obstructs a major 
bloodvessel or fills a test tube 

As de from anticoagulant factors and fibrin a de 
coagulant system may play a role in the del cate 
balance between clot Promoting and clot inhib tmg 
forces It has been suggested tl at fbrlnolys s takes 
place at all times normally dissolving fibrin at the 
same rate as it is being formed Evidence for this 
theory has been adduced from the observac ons that 
a thin coat of fibnn may be found (with special h s 
tologic techniques) to line both the intima and the 
platelets and that (he turnover of clotting factors is 
more rapid than that of most otJ er plasma proteins 
Exaggeration of fibrinolytic activity may lead to 
hemorrhage white its decrease (possiblv by hpemia) 
may enhance tlirombotic tendency and perhaps in

rmrf the Three Phases of Caagttlalian 

The laboratory diagnosis of plasma fac 
tor deficiency rests primarily on localization 
of the defect in the o\erali chain reaction 
of the clotting process i e whether it 
affects thromboplastin formation (phase 
I) prothrombin comersion (phase 11) or 
fibrinogen conversion (phase III) or com 
blnations of these (Table &-1) Additional 
hdpful criteria especiall) of a differential 
diagnostic nature are provided by “cross 
matching” tests (not to be confused with 
pretransfusion tests) adsotbabihty and fate 
of the apparent defect in the clotting 
process i e whether it is present in plasma 
or serum or in both 


The four major patterns of isolated single 
defects and pertinent screemng tests are 
evident from Table 6-7 (1) impairment 

of thromboplastin generation due to defi 
ciency of either AHP, PTC or PTA (and 
HF) revealed by the prothrombin consump- 
tion test or the partial thromboplastin time 
(2) impairment of both thromboplastin 
generation and prothrombin converdon as 
Indicated by the one-stage prothrombin tune 
(Quick) caused by deficiency of either fac 
tor V or X (3) poor prothrombin comer 
Sion caused by diminished activity of either 
factor VII or prothrombin and (4) defi 
ciency In fibrinogen comersion Some of 
the routine differential diagnostic steps 
within each of the first three groups are 
implied fn the right hand part of Table 6-7

legend ) AddiUoml and more specific dif 
ferenaal analysis can fae made by cross 
matching with samples of serum or plasma 
with known clotting defects, these, boweier, 
are not readily available and are therefore 
not considered here as a part of routme 
diagnosis 

With tile use of these three screening 
tests e g , the thrombin time, one stage 
prothrombm test, and prothrombin con 
sumption — one for each of the three phases 
of the coagulation mechanism respectively 
— an existing single clotting defect can, as 
a rule, be classified in terms of these 
phases In many instances, the thrombm 
time may not be needed since observation 
of a firm and normal size clot with either 
of the other two tests, even if tlus endpoint 
IS reached wath some delay, pro\ ides assur- 
ance against a significant deficiency in 
fibnnogen On the other hand, the presence 
of a circulating anticoagulant active against 
individual factors, total thromboplastin or 
thrombin, or the existence of abnorma] 
plasma proteins that inactivate cenam 
factors may be interpreted falsely In terms 
of a clotting factor deficiency 

Hence, a test for circulating anticoagu 
lants IS desirable as a part of the mltial 
screening procedure Whole blood clotung 
time, the most commonly used and age-old 
procedure, lends itself to this purpose How 
ever, the wide normal range and the well 
known technical shortcomings of the test 
greatly detract from its diagnosuc utibty 
The calcium clotting time m oxalated or 
citrated blood or plasma can be standardized 


more conveniently and is indeed more 
suitable for the detection of circulating m 
hibitors, since aUquots of the test material 
can be applied readily to senal dilution 
techniques On the other hand, the whole 
blood clot serves conveniently in routine 
screening for impairment of clot retraction 
and abnormal increase in fibnnolysis 
Thus the classification of a hemostatic 
defect due to deficiency or inhibition of a 
plasma dotting factor may be achieied by 
testing for (a) circulating anticoagulant and 
fibrinolytic activity, (b) impairment of fibnn 
ogen conversion (phase JIT), (c) impairment 
of prothrombin conversion (phase II) (d) de- 
ficient generation of intrinsic thromboplastm 
(phase I) (utilizing basic and relatively 
simple lest procedures, such as (a) whole 
blo(^ clotting or plasma calcium clotting 
lime, (b) thrombin time (c) the one stage 
“prothrombin’ test of Quick, (d) the pro- 
thrombin Consumption test) (Table 6-8) 
Jf the screemng tests for phase I or II 
give abnormal results and a circulating in 
hibitor has been excluded, identification of 
the specific clottmg defect can usually be 
made by means of the same respective test 
procedure, using as “corrective' or cross 
matching reagents plasma and serum se- 
cured either from healthy donors (specially 
prepared) or from patients known to suffer 
from a specific hemorrhagic disorder

solidify (clot) after it has been reino\ed 
from the body The results are greatly in* 
fluenced by a number of physical factors, 
such as the nature of the surface and 
diameter of the test tube (and of the syr* 
inge and needle used in collecung), tern 
perature, and agitation of the blood sample 
Clotting IS accelerated by contact tvith glass, 
by smdler size of the tube, by higher tem- 
perature (up to 38® C ) by turbulence (bub- 
bling), by unduly rapid rate of flow of the 
blood into the syringe (enforced negame 
pressure) and especially by admixture of 
tissue fluid Yvith the blood sample Tissue 
thromboplastin results in circum\enting the 
first phase of coagulation, thereby masking 
any defect in intnnsic thromboplastin 
formation Only if these multiple factors arc 
carefully controlled and the test is carried 
out on “a fixed volume of blood in a (glass) 
test tube of a fixed diameter at a constant 
temperature” can it be regarded as repre- 
senting the ^nt^inslc coagulathe power” 
of the blood (Quick, 1957) Continual prac 
tice with alert attention to details Is cssen 
tlal, because “the determination of clotting 
time is the simplest, the most inforjnatne, 
and technically the most difTictih of all 
common laboratory procedures" (jaques.

Interpretation Suppose the patient s 
plasma showed a prolonged clotting time of 
300 seconds The normal range for platelet 
nch plasma is 90 to 120 seconds and 105 
to 150 seconds for platelet poor plasma The 
result Indicates that the patient has a potent 
anticoagulant because normal clottmg was 
reached only in the test lube that did not 
contain the patients plasma 

If (he clotting defect were due to a plasma 
factor deficiency the correction would have 
taken place ivifh a small amount of normal 
plasma added to the patients plasma be 
cause nonnal plasma has abundant quanti 
ties of most plasma clotting factors

test may also be performed on whole blood

native plasma (Tables 6-9 6-14)

Thrombelastography An estimate of the

The whole blood clotting time (WBCT) often 
called simply clotting time " and the calcium tune 
(CaT) may be expected to uncover a deficiency In 
any phase of the clotting process Indeed abnor 
maiiy long dotting times under standard conditions 
always denote abnormality (factor deficiency or m 
hibitory activity) They do not necessarily indicate 
a bleeding tendency since m the Hageman trait a

tically associated with normal hemostatic function 
A normal WBCT or CaT on the other hand is fre 
quently encountered In the presence of bleeding dis 
ease this is typ cal of a numerical or functional 
platelet defect— except in very severe cases of tfarom 
bocytopenia — and it is also common in mild to mod 
crate coagulopathies (plasma factor deficiencies) 
For practical purposes a normal clotting time 
rules out an abnormally low level of fibrinogen or a 
hepann type anticoagulant but not defects in the 
action or formation of thrombm or thromboplastin 
For this reason numerous technical modifications 
have been devised to make tbe test a more sensitive 
and a more dependable measure of overall dis 
turbance in coagulation The least sensitire pro- 
cedure is the capillary tube method Because of the 
inevitable admixture of tissue fiuid a normal valne 
excludes only fibrmogen deficiency and other types 
of impairment in phase III Hence it may be used 
in monitormg heparin activity in the course of anti 
coagulant treatment The WBCT is rendered more 
sensitive by performing it in siliconized glass tubes 
or at a standardized temperature below 37’ C eg 
25 C but at the same time it becomes far m«e 


Lxboraiory MrxHODs 

Uroe consuming The CaT tends to he more sensiuve 
than the WBCT In glass tubes i e it is more often

ficiency (when performed on slow spun plasma) 
But again a normal calcium clotting tune does not 
exclude a defect in cither phase I or II

Since conversion of fibrinogen to fibnn 
represents the end point in most tests of 
coagulation scrutiny of this third phase of 
the clottmg process should precede analysis 
of earher phases Although thrombin is 
capable of accomplishing this conversion bj 
acting upon purified fibnnogen prepara 
tions the reaction is influenced by tempera 
ture pH calcium concentration and the 
colloidal state of the substrate Among the 
recognized clot promoting accelerating fac 
tors active in plasma under standard con

accelemtor (possibly albumin) and calcium 
The thrombin time does not correlate well 
with fibnnogen concentration in fact it 
tends to be prolonged with an increase in 
fibnnogen beyond the normal range as well 
as with marked reduction m fibrmogen 
reaching infinity m afibrinogenemia Aside 
from these quantitative and possibly also 
qualitative alterations of fibnnogen pro-

the test. It is stable in a silicone-coated 
tube (to prevent adsorption of tbromlnn 
onto glass) for 20 minutes at 37® C. 

Procedure. A 0.2 ml. sample of ice cold, 
platelet-poor plasma (see Table 6-9 for de- 
tails of preparation) Is placed in a small 
glass tube and incubated at 37® C. for three 
minutes. Thereafter, 0.1 ml. of the preincu- 
bated dilute thrombin is added and the clot- 
ting time noted.* Normal range: to 14 

seconds (a control plasma should always 
be tested simultaneously). 

Definite prolongations of TT are encoun- 
tered in a variety of clinical disorders, espe- 
cially in hepatocellular diseases, acute and 
chronic leukemias, lymphosarcoma, sys- 
temic granulomas, multiple myeloma, mal- 
nutrition, and renal disease. At the present 
state of ignorance about the nature and 
significance of the plasma accelerator or of 
nonbeparin antithrombin, two di/Ferential 
tests may be helpful when a markedly pro- 
longed TT is encountered: heparin assay 
to reveal the presence of a heparin-like in- 
hibitor (“correction" with protamine) and 
measurement of fibrinogen. 

Heparin assay. “Correction" of an ab- 
normally long TT by either protamine or

trallzlng capacity — denotes the presence of 
heparin in the test plasma

itself to this an^ysis (Quick. 19S7).

sdution containing 1 mg. (100 units) per

with tvater to prepare solutions of 0.01 
0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0 06 mg. per ml. Add- 
ing 0.1 ml. of each solution per 2 ml. ali- 
quot of plasma (in iced, siliconized tubes) 
results in heparin concentrations of 0 5, 
1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 /ig. per ml of plasma 

According to Figure 6-6, the test plasma 
just mentioned, which is platelet-poor, ap- 
pears to contain 1 ^g. of heparin per ml 
(corresponding to a TT of 25 seconds) The 
two curves in Figure 6-6 demonstrate the 
effect of platelets upon the TT and the 
necessity for distinguishing between plate- 
let-poor and platelet-rich plasma when per- 
forming the test. 

Positive results in the hepaiin assay test

Since, in this experiment, the prolonged

fully “corrected" by the antlhepann agents, 
the presence of heparin-like activity has 
been established. In order to estimate the

plasma containing loiown concentrations of

rrnfnUne. A 0.1 ml. sample of oxalated 
or citraicd plasma and 0. 1 ml. of thrombo- 
plastin (preineubated at 37* C.) arc placed 
in a 13 X 100 mm. test tube and incubated 
In the 37® C. water bath for a few seconds; 
then 0.02 iM CaClj (also prewarmed) is 
forcibly blown Into the tube, the stopwatch 
clicked, and the tube plac(^ in the bath 
and shaken llphily. A few seconds before 
clottinc Is expected, the tube is removed 
from the bath, held acainst a distant light 
source, and tilted sUghtly up and down 
until the incipient web of fibrin Is seen, 
denoting the endpoint.* Normal range (with 
Difeo thromboplastin): 12 to 14 seconds 

* The Clot Timer pro>idr« automatic rxcanlitts of 
the mdpolnt (fig. 6-4). 


Tlie clotting time can become shorter 
and decrease to eight seconds in cltrated 
(not oxalated) plasma stored In a nonslh- 
conized glass tube at refrigerator tempera- 
ture for one or a few days This phenome- 
non has been explained by Quick as the 
result of conversion of inactive prothrombin 
(prothrombinogen) to active prothrombin 
and has been attributed by others to activa- 
tion of lactor VII (proconvertin). 

Ilcsults arc reliable only if the test is done 
within 60 minutes on plasma that has been 
kept at room temperature. Further delay in 
testing requires storage close to 0° C or 
freezing to avoid loss of factor V (labile 
factor). 

A prolonged prothrombin time may be 
c-xpressed in terms of concentration of “pro- 
thrombin" or “prothrombin activity" by pre- 
paring various control plasma dilutions and 
determining their respective prothrombin 
times (analogous to the heparin assay 
curve, see p. 352). As diluent, either saline 
or deprothrombinized (adsorbed) plasma 
may be used, but clotting times differ with 
plasma concentrations less than 50 per cent, 
being more prolonged in the sahne than 
In the atfsorbcd-plasma scries (Table 6- 
10, Fig. G-8). Thus, a clotting time of 19 
seconds in a test plasma may be inters 
preted as representing 30 to 35 per cent 
prothrombin activity from the saline ^u- 
tions but only 10 per cent on the basis of 
adsorbed plasma dilutions. Undoubtedly the 
longer clotting times observ'ed with saline 
dilutions stem from the attendant reduc- 
tion in concentration of factors V and I.

which make this system Jess specific for the

than the adsorbed plasma technique Hence 
for purposes of momtormg oral anticoagu 
lant therap) (which may depress factor VII 
alone or VII and II or the entire complex) 
the adsorbed plasma technique would seem 
to be preferable 

For practical purposes reporting the pro- 
thrombm time in seconds is sufficient pro- 
xlded the control result is also furmshed 
for instance 25 seconds (control 12 sec 
onds) If per cent "prothrombin” acuxit> 
IS also to be stated the dilution method 
used must be reported The conventional 
aim of oral anticoagulant therapy is pro- 
longauon of the prothrombin time two to 
two and one half times the pretreatment 
level (or the control value) Hence with 
a control of 12 seconds a patient value of 
less than 24 seconds would denote made 
quatc anticoagulation while a clotting time 
greater than 30 seconds may be regarded 
as indicative of an excessive bleeding

Combined Estimation of Prothrombin

fibnn formed is estimated on the basis of 
the opucal density of the clot (Volk et al

plasma and 0 1 ml of thromboplastin 
(Difco) are placed in a cuvet at 37° C for 
three minutes At the same time as 0 1 ml 
of CaCl IS swiftly blown into the cuvet a 
stopwatch IS started and the optical density 
of the cuvet is recorded m the photometer 
at wave length 500 m^t 

As soon as movement of the light beam 
IS noted on the density scale to the left 
the stopwatch Is stopped this is the pro- 
thrombin time The distance the beam 
travels on the scale until it comes to a 
standstill denotes completion of clotting

tical densities times 100 represents the “clot 
density” <d) Fibrinogen (mg per 100 ml ) 
= I8d -f 120 (=empmcal formula) 

The prothrombin tune values furnished 
by this method tend to be somewhat shorter 
(0 5 second) than with the visual tKh 
nique The method lends itself to routine 
work m a hospital laboratory and may be 
superior to the visual technique because of 
the greater objectmty of the results The 
simultaneous estimate of fibrinogen pro- 
vides useful information especially with 
marked increase of fibrinogen as is com 
monly found in acute myocardial infarction 
and active rheumatic fever The increased 
level of fibrinogen has been found to be a 
more dependable measure of clinical prog 
ress than the scdimentauon rate Estimation 
of a decrease m fibrinogen with this method 
is bmited to levels exceeding 120 mg per 
100 ml since in the formula just given a 
clot density of 0 would yield a fibrinogen 
value of 120 

The normalcy of results of the prothrom 
bln time depends upon adequate concentm 
tions of four plasma clotting factors 11 ' 
VII and X aside from a normal fbrlno'’en 
level and absence of a circulating antico- 
agulant active In the second or third stige

contribute to clinical diagnosis and be Jm 
poriant In treatment (Tabic G-11) Thus 
in jaundice factor V deficiency eliminates 
avitaminosis K as the sole cause of the 
prolonged “prothrombin time" and of bleed 
ing if present and indicates hepatocellular 
disease parenteral administration of the 
vitamin cannot be expected to correct the 
defect Similarly In hemorrhagic disease of 
the newborn factor V deficiency suggests 
either Jner disease or a congenital disorder 
while confinement of the abnormality to 
“scrum" factors strongly implicates vitamin 
K deficiency and points to the corrective 
therapy In general rational treatment of a 
bleeding disorder manifesting itself in a 
prolonged prothrombin time dciM7nds upon 
the specific defect present since factor V is 
uninfluenced by vitamin K treatment and 


may be insuificlcntly supplied (because of 
Its instability) when transfusion of stored

prolonged MCT obsened i«tb the patients 
reagents or a normal MCT reached after 
the sixth minute is Indicative of poor throm 
boplasiin formation Such a result requires 
further analysis to determine which of the 
patients blood fractions are responsible As 
a matter of routine each of the control 
fractions except the substrate is now re 
placed by a patient fraction in the control 
s>stem and the results tabulated followed 
by the opposite combination (confirma 
lory test) the respective patient reagent 
IS substituted by the control reagent in the

substitution runs appears to identify the 
defective patient reagent the analysis may 
be terminated Thus if the patients plate- 
let suspension combined with control serum 
and plasma yields a prolonged MCT and 
the inverse system (control platelets with 
patients serum and plasma) yields a nor

platelet defect (thrombasthenia) and pre

grade deficiency in pHtelet factor 3 may

longed MCT On the other hand if the 
patients platelets yielded a normal result 
when normal platelets were replaced in the 
control system but normal platelets did not 
rectif) the prolonged MCT when used in 
the patient system his platelets can be 
assumed to release normal quantities of 
platelet factor 3 and the search for the 
defect must go on In like manner substl 
tution of prtients serum or adsorbed plasma 
In the normal system and \ice \ersa tvill 
rule in or out a defect in either of these 
fractions 

The substitution process usually is not 
extended to the substrate since this has 
been found to be the source of an abnormal 
MCT only in deficiency of either prothrom 
bin or fibrinogen Tlie former should be 
detected with the routine one stage pro- 
thrombin test which would >iold a pro- 
longed clotung time not corrected by aged 
serum (p 356) Similar}), fibnnogcn do- 
ficiencj would be readily discotered with 
the routine screening tests e g \VBCT 
prothrombin time or TT These tests should 
always precede the TGT Hence whether the 
patients or the control subjects substrate 
IS used is usually irrelevant 

The finding of a serum defect mthout a plasma 
defect denaics deficiency of either factor DC or X 
If the prothrombin time is normal Stuart factor de 
Beiencjr is errjuded and laeter IX it impiieated 
(Table 6-14 patient 6) If the prothrombin time »« 
pToIonped the diagnosM is either deficfency of factor 
X or a combination of two or more deficiencies such 
as factor IX and factor Vll Diflmntial analysis of 
the prothrombin time is usually helpful in malimc 
this distinction but scrum from a factor DC or X 
deficient person if available presides the most di 
rect and reliable approach to differenttal diagnosis 
If IX-def cient serum added to the incubation mix 
ture so that it replaces 25 to 50 per cent of the pa 
tient 8 serum fails to correct the TGT result the pa 
tient must have a factor IX deficiency in addition 
to a defect in the prothrombin complex If it corrects 
he probably has an isolated factor X deficiency 

Analogous considerations apply to the finding of 
a defect in the patient s adsorbed plasma fraction 
ivith his serum behaving normally The diagnosis of 
factor VIII (AHF) deficiency Is established in the 
presence of a normal prothrombin time (Table 6-14 
patient C> If the latter is abnormal dilTerential 
analysis between factor V deficiency and a multiple 
factor deficiency is necessary such as deficiency of 
factors V and VIII eg a hemophiliac with acute 
hepatitis Since factors V and VIII are both heat 
labile normal plasma erposed to 37* C. or even to 
average room temperature for 12 or more hours will 
become deficient in these factors Such a specimen 
may be used to advantage for practice Again analy 
sis of the one-stage prothrombin time usually clail 
fies the situation but use of either V or Vlll-de 
ficient plasma affords the most direct and conclusive 
evidence If adsorbed \ Ill-deficient plasma is sub- 
stituted for one-fourth to one half the patient s ad 


sorbed plasma in the Incubation mixture and fails 
to correct the diagnosis of AHF deficiency (hemo- 
phiha A) must be made If it corrects the patient s 
plasma presumably is deficient in factor V 

Brief mention should be made of two more diag 
nostic constellations that may be encountered upon 
differential analysis of abnormal thromboplastin 
seneration tests (a) The patients serum and ad 
sorbed plasma yield normal results when substituted 
Individually in the control system but furnish pro- 
longed clotting times when combined in either the 
control or pat ent "run (Table 6-14 patient D) 
<b) The patients serum and adsorbed plasma give 
prolonged clotting times whether used singly or In 
combination in the control system (patient E) 

Ad (a) In the first Instance a defect must be 
postulated that is corrected by either control serum 
or control (adsorbed) plasma since both must be 
excluded from the incubation mixture to result ui 
an abnormal MCT Since PTA and HF are the factors 
present in normal serum and are not eliminated 
from plasma by the usual adsorption technique the 
diagnosis is PTA or HF deficiency The differential 
analysis between these two factors is Indicated in 
the legend to Table 6-7 

Ad (b) Abnormal activity displayed by both the 
patient s serum ontf plasma constitufes evidence for 
either multiple factor deficiency or circulating anti 
coagulant If in the control run substituting one 
half the control serum or plasma with the respective 
patient s reagents results in a normal MCT a double 
deficiency (scrum and plasma) must be assumed 
suggesting a combination of hemophilia A and B 
An abnormal result caused by this maneuver estab- 
lishes evidence for the presence of inhibitory aetiv 
ity against one of the prothrombcplastins in the pa 
iientt serum and plasma A minute quantity of the 
latter agents in an otherwise normal system may 
cause an abnonna) MCT In other words the proper 
lion of patients to control serum (or plasma) may 
have to be reduced to 1 to 9 or less in order to secure 
a nmmai value (patient £ cf p 34S) 

Aside from the routine diagnosis of hemorrbagic 
disorders the TGT has many other applications 
Thus it may be used for assay of an isolated de 
ficiency utiliring the principle of determining the 
minimal amount of control reagent (or of a pun 
lied factor preparation) that can correct the abnoi 
roal clotung time Furthermore recognition of hy 
percoagulability may be attempted by means of the 
lest For this purpose higher dtluuons of either 
serum or plasma or both are used so that the nor 
mal MCT is increased and unusual shortening may 
be disceriuble (Spittel et el 1960) Details of these 
procedures are beyond the scope of this book 

Ctrcrt/rrfrtig rtn/tctMgrtlan/t and Al/normal

Tlie highly reactive products of the coagu 
latjon system thromboplastin and thrombin 
are probably balanced by several in^bitors 
Thus normal plasma or serum has anti 
thrombic activity and a fraction has been 
isolated from normal plasma exhibiting 
anticoagulant activity to factor VIII It has 
been claimed that an inhibitor exists physi 
ologically for each clottmg factor especially

adsorbs nascent thrombin in the course of 
clotting (see pp 324 339) 

Antithrombm(s) as well as inhibitors to 
other clotting factors and to platelets may 
occur in excessive concentration and give 
nse to hemostatic defects (Table 6-15) 
Aside from platelet antibodies (lysms ag 
glutimns) causing thrombocytopemc pur 
pura circulatmg mhibitors of plasma clot 
ting factors may be acquired by patients 
with hemophilia A B or C women during 
or foUotving pregnancy and m connection 
with certain systemic diseases chiefly those 
involving alteration in plasma proteins (“col 
lagen” ^seases leukemia other neoplastic 
disorders) In turn the finding of hyper 
globulinemia or of abnormal globulins (dys , 
paraproteinemia) should make one suspect 
interference with normal hemostatic func 
tions Excessite or abnormal globulins have 
been shown to chelate with some of the 
normal clotting factors such as factor V 
to interfere with conversion of fibrinogen 
to fibrin and to tie up calcium causing a 
functional" hypocalcemia 

In most instances the anticoagulant action may 
be related to an abnormal immune mechanism and 
can be located m the gamma globulin fraction of 
plasma or serum Thus in hemophilia inhibitory 
activity against the deficient clotting factor may de- 
velop after transfusion of blood and especially in 
the instance of AHF deficiency of Cohn fracbon I

cidental to their particular physical properties Much 
of the time the effect is noticed chiefly in the third 
phase of coagulation (thrombin time) 

Although demonstration of a circulating inhibiwt 
of blood clotting is a fairly rare experience this pos- 
sibility must be considered in every instance of a 
hemorrhagic disorder or abnormal results of clotting 
tests Presence of an active anticoagulant may be re 
sponsible for severe symptoms and may corapbeate 
problems of clinical diagnosis and therapy Hence 
Its detection and determination of mode of action are 
important (asks for the laboratory (see Table C-17) 
If normal plasma does not readily correct the clot 
ting defect encountered upon routine testing of a 
patients plasma an inhibitor is indicated rather 
than a double defect This conclusion also presents 
Itself If both (he patients adsorbed plasma and 
scrum yield abnormal thromboplastin generation 
when other reagents m the TGT system (platelets 
substrate plasma) are normal This testis most use- 
ful m determining the site of action of an anti 
(pro-) thromboplastin while Ibe prothrombin and 
thrombin times lend themselves readily to anal)sis 
of anticoagulant activity in phases II and III respec 
lively 

The basic pnnuple applied to detection of antico- 
agulant action arises from the usual observation 
(hat a minute quantity of normal blood or plasmi 
added to an apparently defective blood or plasma 
fails to correct the abnormal result of the test being 
applied whether it is the whole blood clotting time 
(he calcium clotting time of plasma the protbrom 
bin tune the prothrombin consumption test or the 
thrombin time (p 349) With deficiency of a clot 
ting factor full correction is usually attained since 
normal plasma contains each of these factors in 
abundant quantities (The only exception is fibrino- 
gen deficiency in which equal parts of normal and 
test plasma may be required to correct a prolonged 
clotting time ) As a rule in the presence of an in 
hibitor an inverse proportion of normal to patients 
plasma of 10 to 1 Is required for full or nearly com 
plete correction In other words a small quantity of 
normal plasma will correct the abnormal clotting 
test of a factor-deficient plasma v-heieas a small 
volume of inhibilor-contauung plasma added to nor

Exogenous ANTiconcutANTS 

Aside from heparin which is often used for the 
purpose of ant coagulation certain types of medica 
tion have an Incidental anticoagulant effect espe 
cially plasma expanders such as dextran and poly 
vinyl pyrrolid ne (PVP> and cthylenediaminetetrA 
acetic acid (EDTA) a detoxifying agent that can he 
used to facilitate removal of heavy metals from the 
body Tile hemostatic defect caused by dextran 
manifests itself chiefly (and was uncovered) by a 
prolonged bleeding time presumably resultmg from 
physical adsorption of the large molecules on plate 
lets and thereby Interfering with their function 
The delaying effect of EDTA upon clotting is due not 
only to its chclatmg action on calcium which is 
minimized by use of the calcium salt but to its

Excessive fibrinolytic activity of the cir 
culating blood causing hemorrhagic mam 
festations is an infrequent observation 
When It occurs it is usually serious m ex 
tent and often disastrous in outcome 

The physiologic significance of the fibrino- 
lytic system IS still poorly understood except 
that quite generally it is instrumental in 
dissolving intravascular thrombi and is re- 
sponsible for TcJjquefjang blood after 
death The decoagulant process may not be 
less complex m terms of number of fac 
tors and their Interaction than the clotting 
mechanism per se There is evidence for 


close interaction between the two mecha 
nisms so that they may well be regarded as 
parts of a single overall system concerned 
with maintaining fluidity of the blood and 
with defense of the orgamsm against blood 
loss and infection The latter task is sug 
gested by the increase in circulating fibnno 
gen with systemic inflammation deposiuon 
of fibrin m areas of active mfection and its 
dissolution when the hosts immune forces 
win the upper hand (example bacterial 
pneumoma) The umty of the mechanism 
IS apparent from the fact that fibnnolysin 
readily inactivates various clotting factors 
especially factors V and VIII and that en 
hancement of fibrinolytic action can be de 
tccted at the time of clotting or even before 
Experimental evidence indicates that the 
refease of serotomn from pfatefets may in 
itiatc this enhancement 

The schematic representation of the 
fibrinolytic system in Figure 6-12 shows 
that the key substance plasmm js normally 
present in the form of a precursor com 
parable to prothrombin which is activated 
to the effective lytic enzyme by various 
factors contained m tissues biologic fluids 
bacteria and other substances e g plasma 
and unne activators (urokinase) trypsin 
strepto- and staphylokinase chloroform 
other organic solvents and peptone 
Enhanced fibrinolytic activity has been 
encountered in physiologic states such as 
hypoxia mental stress and severe physical 
exercise ExpenmentiUy it can be produced 
by injection of epinephrine acetylcholine 
pyrogens (bacterial polysacchandes) and 
pharmacologic agents especially meonme

acid The increase in fibrinolysis can be 
attributed to an increase m circulating 
activator rather than to the activated en 
zyme itself Pathologic fibrinolytic activity 
is usually attributed to either release of 
abnormal amounts of plasminogen activator 
from tissues or entrance of thromboplastic 


material into the circulation (^suiting in 
defibrination and secondary fibnnol^tic re- 
sponse) Fibrinolytic purpura is caused not 
only by lysis of fibnn or of clrculaung

proxasion should alivays be made for de 
tecting excessne fibnnoljttc actinty, if 
present Thus, the clot resulting from one 
of the screening tests — usuallj the whole 
blood clotting Ume or prothrombm time — 
should regularly be incubated at 37* C for 
several hours (preferably overnight) A 
grossly noticeable decrease in the size of 
the clot or its complete disappearance de- 
notes excessive fibnnolytic activity This 
findmg may at times furmsh the explana- 
tion for abnormal results wnth other clot- 
tmg tests such as the prothrombin time or 
the prothrombin consumption test, since 
plasmm is knowm to inactivate several of 
the clotting factors, especially factors V, 
Vn, and VIII Once excessive fibrinolysis 
has been recognized its quantiiatne 
measurement is indicated, and a qualitative 
study may be desirable The latter would 
consist of determinmg whether the cxces 
sive fibnnolysis encountered is due to an 
increase in circulating activator or in active 
plasmln or to a change in the plasminogen 
level (the latter may be decreased as a 
result of accelerated conversion to plasmm) 
Since practical methods for this dificrenu^ 
analysis remain to be developed, a simple 
procedure will be described that permits 
detecuon of excess of total fibnnolytic activ 
ity A quanutauve assay of fibnnolysis was 
reported b> Hougie and Ayers (1960) Its 
clinical value remains to be established A

transferred from the ice bath into a 37’

10 units of tlirombin is added to each tube 
with immediate mixing Each clot is then 
observed at frequent intervals (at least ev

detection of complete lysis Normallv, no

Isotopology; Applications in the 
Clinical Pathology Laboratory 

By OSCAR B HUNTER, JR , M D 


Isotopes are a comparatively new addition 
to the tools available to the clinical pa 
thologist Although they have been available 
for 20 years in usable form, the practical 
use of these elements in the clinical path- 
ology laboratory has only recently become 
widespread The basts for the practical ap- 
plication of Isotopes 1 $ their capacity to mix 
with normal elements One is able to follow 
the course of these elements through the 
chemical and biologic processes of the body 
and m this way determine and quantitate 
certain bodily functions, hence, the designa 
tion, “tracer substances or “tracers” The 
only limitations placed upon the utilization 
of these elements are those imposed by our 
ability to conceive of new ways to integrate 
them into metabolic and chemical processes 
A Wide \anety of elements having different 
physical constants can be used, depending 
upon the need and the purpose However, 
isotopes must be used according to estab- 
lished rules so that they may be followed 
through a selected metabolic process with- 
out causing damage to the tissues by their 
capacity to produce lomzation 

In this chapter, the use of isotopes In the 
study of bodily functions will be outlined 
After a brief discussion of the theoretic 
background, each test will be described and 
the procedure outlined in detail • Space 
limitations make it impossible to Include 
much information on the physics of the 
isotopes For this aspect of the subject, the 
student Is referred to reliable texts listed 
In the bibliography (Hamwell and Stephens 
1955 HoDaender, 1954, McMillan 3947, 
Quimby et al , 1958) 

•Miss Nellie May Bering MT (ASCPJ, has 
given much assistance in detaibng the procedures 


FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES 

The use of isotopes as tracer substances 
depends on three basic factors decay fac 
tor. metabolic factor, and isotope dilution 

The decay of i»50topes vanes but for each 
element and for each isotope of each ele 
ment (here is a constant rate of decay to 
the state of the basic stable element The 
rate of decay is expressed as the half life 
of the isotope Ide^y the half life should 
be long enough to permit use of the isotope 
as a measure of a given function of the 
body but short enough so that it docs not 
remain In (he body too long and cause in 
jury Thus, is a satisfactory isotope, 
having a half life of 8 08 days If given in 
tracer amounts it permits adequate time for 
study but at the same time decays rapidly 

In selecting an isotope one must con 
sider its role in metabolism is Ideal for 
the study of thjToid function, since It Is 
metabolized almost exclusively by the thy 
roid gland Co*^ in vitamin B,» is ideal for 
the study of permcious anemia, since it can 
be used as a tracer for the metabobc process 
in question 

The Isotope diluuon factor must be con 
sidered, because the isotope should be avail 
able m sufficient concentration to be dif 
ferentiatcd from background radiation If 
1**' tagged serum albumin is not localized In 
the tumor In greater concentration than in 
the surrounding tissue it is of little value 
for tumor locabzation 

INSTRUMENTATION 

Isotope detection depends on energy re-

leased xn alpha («) beta (^) and gamma 
(y) ra>s For all practical studies beta and 
gamma rays are the onl> ones used Beta 
rays arc electrons with limited penetrabilitj 
The> are able to tra\erse onlj 1 cm of tissue 
and for this reason are not suitable for the 
study of deep organs They may be detected 
readily in body fluids Gamma rays have an 
infinite power of penetration Therefore 
they are used as tracers in the body and 
in body fluids 

Accuracy of determination depends on 
the umform assaying of standards and un 
knowns the use of rehable instruments and 
adherence to adequate limits of mean de 
viation by doing adequate counts for the 
sample 

UMFOIUr ASSV\1NG 

Usually the standard is an isotope source 
outside the body while the unknown is 
within the body or body fluid The sample 
to be measured should be m a Utmted area 
Ideally to be accurate for measurement an 
isotope source should be a point source 
Under such circumstances the ndiation 
measurement can be calculated to be m 
versely proportional to the square of the 
distance between the source and the de 
tector 

Point sources are necessarily only theo- 
retic Hence it becomes necessary to mim 
mize the variation between the standard 
source and the unknown This is accom 
phshed by having the standard source as 
nearly geometrically identical to the un 
known as possible 

Consideration should be given to the 

biologic variation le the concentration or 
dilution of the isotope by biologic processes 
the size and shape of the specimen and 
radioactn e reflection and absorption 

The radiauon used for tracer work is al 
most entirely of the beta and gamma types 
Beta radiating isotopes are used almost ex 
clusively In assays of body fluids Gamma 
radiating isotopes have a wide application 
including the study of body fluids secre- 
uons unne and feces 

Biologic processes that concentrate elc 
ments as tagged materials make function 
studies feasible In other instances the lack 
of concentraUon or actual dilution in body 
fluids helps to make the assay possible 

It is important to establish identical or 
nearly identical conditions for comparing 
the activity of isotopes Most determinations 
depend on the comparison of the radloacUv 


Laboiuvtorv Mftiiods 

ity of a standard with that of an unknown 
Counting the radioactivity of the standard 
should be earned out under circumstancts 
as similar as possible to those under vvliich 
the unknowai is counted For example the 
standard for thyToid uptake of I'^i should 
be comparable to the thyroid of a Inini; 
patient For that purpose a phantom or 
dummy is used containing an amount of 
!»’• equal to that given the pauent Fluid 
specimens should be compared to standards 
in similar containers in approximately the 
same volume 

Finally the problem of reflection and ab- 
sorption of radioactivnty needs to be con 
sidered If the counter Is directed at different 
walls m measuring the patient and the 
standard different reflected radiation may 
be encountered 

These factors are important and must be 
considered in settmg up conditions for as 
say The principle of measunng under con 
diuons as closely identical as possible is a 
good one to follow 

INSTRUMENTS 

All instruments used to detect radioactive 
isotopes actually measure the ionization 
produced by alpha and beta particles and 
their electrical charges Gamma rays and 
neutrons produce ionization by collision 
with atomic particles resulting m a knoc^ 
ing out of electrons or of other neutrons 
and protons 

Gamma ray activity may be classified Into 
three effects 

1 Photoelectric effect ejection of an or 
bital electron from an atom with absorption 

2 Compton effect ejection of an or 
bital electron and continuation of the 
gamma ray at a lower peak of energy 

3 Pair production Wien the gamma nv 
of sufTicient energy passes close to a nu 
cleus two electrons arc split off one pod 
lively charged and the other ncgntivelv 
charged 

These gamma ray effects arc the detected 
ionization that instruments enable us to 
quantitate

IS the activity force and the flow of charged 
particles to either pole depends on this dif

which IS knoivn as the Geiger Muller curve 
At very low voltage no detecUon will reg 
ister By increasing the voltage, one can 
detect an increasing number of ions until a 
plateau is reached In this area moderate 
vanations in voltage produce little change 
in the number of ions detected above this 
lei el however, a continuous discharge or 
aialanche of ions occurs This is harmful to 
the detector and will bum it out The 
counter is best used in the plateau area 
where voltage variation produces little 
change in the ions delected Hare the loruz 
tag effect produces an electrical impulse 
which can be counted and used to quantl 
tate the amount of radiation (Fig 7-1 ) 

Scintillalion Counter 

Sodium iodide crystals gi\e off a small 
amount of hght when ionizing radiation 
penetrates them These crystals are encased 
in an aluminum jacket open at the end 
The end is sealed to a photomultipber tube, 
which has a photosensitive layer next to 
tlie crystal and an electronic multiplier The 
multiplier builds up each ionizing effect 
to an electrical pulse of sufficient strength 
to activate a scaler device 

The scintillation counter operates on the 
same general principle as the Geiger counter 
\vith a minimal \ oltage necessary to activate 
the tube and a small plateau in which small 


Clinical Pathology Laboratory 373 

vanations of voltage produce little change 
in counts Increasing the voltage beyond 
tins level produces an avalanche of counts 
called a dynode noise Each counter has a 
separate plateau, and this should be checked 
from time to rime for accurate results 

Scalers 

The scaler is used to measure impulses 
produced m the counters These are either 
mechanical or electromc and the counts 
may be made by bmary or decimal scales 
Scalers are used on pre-set umes or pre set 
counts, the most commonly used scalers 
measure counts per minute 

Spectrometers 

The energy of radiation produces light in 
sodium iodide crystals m proporaon to the 
strength of the radiation This m turn pro- 
duces a proporuonally strong pulse m the 
sctntillauon counter The strength of these 
pulses can be measured and specific iso- 
topes identified by their detected gamma 
radiahon 

In this manner the radiation from single 
isotopes of a nuxture can be determined 
This is done by a spectrometer equipped 
with an electronic window which can ad 
mit pulses of selected heights without ad 
mitting those higher or lower Such a de 
voce permits one to count separate isotopes 
and to count only primary radiation and no 
scatter or Compton effect It also permits a 
reduction in the effect of background, mean 
ing umversally existing radiation 

Operation of Spectrometer and Scinttlh' 
lion Counter To operate these instruments 
one should first establish the normal curve 
for the counter The scaler should be al 
lowed to warm up for 30 minutes A stand 
ard radiation source is then placed before 
the counter Counts can then be plotted 
against voltage and the curve drawn The 
proper operating voltage for each counter 
is the midpomt of the plateau 

The spectrometer may be plugged into 
the circuit and a cesium source placed be 
fore the counter The high voltage regulator 
on the scaler may be turned up so as not to 
interfere with the spectrometer A 10 volt 
window may be set with the center of the 
window at 0 662 mev (million electron 
volts) The voltage reguiator then should be 
\aned to test the counts at the highest 
levd Following this the instrument may be 
used, resetting the window at the energy 
levd for the particular Isotope desired TlJe

The flat field collimator is designed lo 
detect a relauvely large area of radiation 
while the straight bore t>Tx; usually has a 
single small hole in a lead nose piece and 
measures radiation in a very limited area 
The focusing collimator is designed to use a 
larger scmtillation counter with multiple 
holes directed toward a focus point in front 
of the instrument Theoretically this permits 
smaller quantities of isotopes to be used 
(Fig 7-2) 


Collimation utihzes the principle of 
shielding so as to measwro tadvatvon from a 
himted point of a radiation source It also 
aids in reducing the effects of background 
radiauon Different collimators may be used 
and are an important adjunct to accurate 
radiation measurement There are three cs

titated, but unlike ordinary chemicals the 
problem of decay of isotopes must always 
be taken into account 

Blood volume studies are the best ex 
ample of the application of the dilution prin 
ciple In this case, estimates of the total 
volume of the blood are made on the basis 
that the total value is proportional to the 
dilution of the introduced isotope This can 
be expressed as an equation (shown at bot 
tom of page) 

This does not account for the variations 
in rate of isotope decay if the half life 
is short, an appreciable difference may re 
suit in any long term study Thus the time 
factor related to the half life of the isotope 
must be considered For example. In a study 
involving Cr®‘, which has a half life of 27 8 
days, an observation made 26 days after 
Introduction of Cr®* would show only half 
the radioactivity that was present at the 
start of the study, regardless of any biologic 
factors causing reduction m the concentra 
Won of the isotope This problem may be 
eliminated in many instances if one cancels 
out the decay factor by placing in the stand 
ard at the beginning of the study the iden 
tical dose of the isotope that is being ad 
ministered to the patient Samples taken 
from the patient then can always be com 
pared with the standard, which Is decaymg 
at the same rate 

Calihratton atul CatuiUng 

Assays of radioactive samples are subject 
to errors familiar to mathematicians but 
frequently overlooked by physicians These 
errors result from the vanabibtf of decaj of 
the isotope and the limitations of the instru 
ments used for counting Therefore, it is 
necessary to know the error or errors in 
voiced m the procedure and to establish 
conditions of testing that will reduce the 
errors to a minimum This may be done by 
varying the quantity of counts in the sam 
pie or by varying tlie time of the observa 
tion The error may also be decreased by 
reducing the background radiation 

Thus in any count the standard error 
may be determined by the following for 
mula 


Clinical Pathology Laboratory 375 

SD = -f ^ in which SD = stand 

ard deviation, = observed number of 
counts in the sample, N, = observed num 
her of counts in the background, tj = time 
counted for sample, and tb = time counted 
for background (Quimby et al, 19S8) Com 
putauons of the standard error indicate that 
the counts of a given sample will fall within 
these limits in 6S per cent of the cases and 
outside these limits m 32 per cent of the 
cases, this is called 68 per cent confidence 
To obtam results that have 90 per cent con 
fidence, in which the counts will fall within 
the limits 90 per cent of the nme the 
formula is supplied with a new constant

gland, and Is used to lodmate tyrosine, 
which m turn forms the active thyroid hot

These are bound to the protem, thyro-

one may determine thjToid function by com

Any time interval may be used such as 2, 
6, 12 and 24 hours For practical purposes 
the 24 hour interval seems to be accurate

The Procedure 

Radioiodine’’** Thyroid Uptake 

1 A number of doses of I should be 
prepared before the patient reports to the 
laboratory The doses are placed in the 
phantocube and counted at a measured dis 
tance from the end of the scintillation probe 
One of these doses is chosen as the stand 
ard 

2 The patient is questioned regarding 
intake of substances that may interfere 
with this study and regarding possible con 
tiaindications to the test such as pregnancy 
The patient is given a dose of The 
test tube containing the dose is washed 
three tunes with water and the patient 
drinks each of these washings 

3 The patient is instructed to avoid salt 
seafood and cabbage and to return to the 
laboratory in 24 hours 

4 A short tune prior to the patients re 
turn to the laboratory the standard is 
counted m the same manner as was done 
when the doses were prepared The room 
background radiation is measured 

5 The patients neck is palpated to find 
the thyroid gland The sanlillation probe 
is then adjusted at a measured distance 
from a point just abo\c the isthmus of the 
gland and the gland counted for three mm 
utes We usually repeat this by repositioning 
the probe to see whether the positioning is 
good and to make sure that the probe did 
not move during the counting The variation 
between the two counts should be less than 
2 per cent 

6 A thigh background count is done be 
fore each uptake 

7 The tliigh background value is sub- 
tracted from both the readings of the pa 
tient to determine the cepm (corrected 
counts per minute) The room background 
is similarly subtracted from the reading of 
the standard 

8 The patient s corrected counts per mm 
ute are divided by the standard corrected 


counts per minute (times 100) (equal to 100 
per cent of the dose) to obtain the per cent 
uptake by the gland 

9 Normal 25 per cent to 45 per cent

Standard Plasma 

Standard plasma is prepared by pooling 
the plasmas from 20 euthyroid persons and 
giving it the arbitrary value of 1 00 If this 
test cannot be performed on the day the 
blood IS drawn, the plasma should te ic 
moved and frozen All plasmas used as 
standards must remain frozen until time of 
use and once thawed out should not be 
refrozen for future use

This mixture is shaken for 30 minutes 
At the end of this time the resm is filtered 
washed once with distilled water, and al 
lowed to dry at room temperature 

Approximate 0 1 gm portions of this 
labeled resin are placed m individual glass 
tubes (100 X 16 mm ) These tubes arc 
counted in a standard well counter The 
amount of resin in each tube is adjusted to 
give equal (within 2 per cent) activity m 
each tube 'Hie tubes are then left at room 
temperature until used but for no longer 
thanjtwo weeks 

Method The plasma to be tested and the 
standard plasma are treated identically as 
follows 

1 2 ml of the plasma to be tested is 
added to each resin tube (EDTA or 
double oxalate but not hepann, may 
be used as anticoagulants ) 

2 The stoppered tubes are shaken at 
35* C for 90 minutes and at the end 
of that time the resin is allowed W 
settle to the bottom of the tube

human serum albumm is difiusable, sped 
mens of blood must be witbdraivn as soon 
as possible after mixing in the blood Ten 
minutes is the best time Shorter periods do 
not allow for mixing longer periods allow 
for diffusion, which gives greater values than 
actually exist The method is sufficiently ac 
curate for clinical use

Test for Peniictotis Anemia 

This procedure is useful in classifying 
megaloblastic anemias. The chief error 
arises from the failure to collect urine speci- 
mens accurately. A large amount, also 
known as a flushing dose, of nonradioactive 
Bis fs best given after one hour, although an 
interval of four to six hours may be used. 
The flushing dose should be large enough 
to saturate the tissue fluids and to bind sites 
ivith Bi 2 that will permit the excretion of 
the ingested dose. Gaffney et al. (1959) 
showed that one hour is adequate. If the 
\atamin BijCo'''’ excretion is low, the test 
jnvsf be repeated svitb the JnJjixvuc factor 
to confirm the diagnosis of permcious ane- 
mia. Defects in intestinal absorption may 
be detected by this method, since results 
of both procedures %vill be low in such in- 
stances. Treatment with vitamin B,2 should 
be withheld for at least three days before 
the test 

Schilling Test Co^Jtiz (SchilUng, 1953; 

Glass et al.. 1954) 

Part A 

1. Two doses of Co^*' are prepared. 0.5 
fiC. each; one dose is the standard and the 
other is given to the patient. 

2 The Co'''’B |5 containing 0.5 ^c. Co*’ as 
radiocyanocobalamin is given orafly to a 
fasting patient ivith an empty bladder. 


3. One hour later a “flushing dose" of B,. 
containing 1000 micrograms of crj-stalline 
nonradioactive B12 is administered intra- 
muscularly. 

4. Have the patient collect all urine for 
the next 24 hours and return the specimen 
to the laboratory. (Note: Failure to collect 
all urine voided during the 24-hour period 
introduces considerable error.) 

5. When the urine is received, measure 
and record volume; if less than 1000 ml , 
fill up with water to 1000 ml. 

6. Prepare standard by dUuting 0.5 uc. of 
Co«® to 1000 ml. 

7. Read 3.0 ml. of the urine sample and 
3.0 mL of the standard in the w’ell scintilla- 
don counter. The ccpm may be low. If this 
is true, count for a longer lime. If necessary, 
count for 10 to 15 minutes. 

8. Calculations: 

% Co^^Bis excreted ss 
ccpm of 3.0 ml. of urine X vot of urine X 100 
ccpm of 3 0 ml. of the staii^id X dUuuon factor 

9. Normal range: 7 per cent or more, of 
dose administered is excreted in the urine 
in the first 24 hours. Patients with per- 
nicious anemia excrete only from 0 to less 
than 3 per cent of the radioactive vitamin 
if it is given alone, but from 3.1 to 30 per 
cent if the intrinsic factor was given simul- 
taneously. 

Part B 

1. If less than 7 per cent of dose adminis- 
tered is excreted in the urine in the first 
24 hours, the examination is repeated. At 
the time the patient is given 0.5 )xC. of Co*^. 
he is also given a capsule containing 60 
micrograms o£ mjlrirtsic factor, 

2 The same procedure is followed as 
outlined in Part A. 

3. If the excreted amount of Co“ rises 
to normal levels, the diagnosis of pernicious 
anemia is established; if the excretion of 
Co®* does not rise foUowing administration 
of the intrinsic factor, the patient has a mal- 
absorption syndrome. 

Measurement of fecal excretion hat 
shown only about 30 per cent recover)’ h

sion. 

Radioactive Iron (Fe*®) 
Radioactive iron may be used to

performed to determine the cause of \rariotiS 
types of anemia:

Radioacme iron supplied as iron citrate 
(Fe^®) may be utilized in a study of iron 
actudty in the bod> A comparatively small 
dose of the iron as ferrous citrate may be 
given Approximately 4 micrograms of iron 
with an activity of 4 to 5 microcuries is 
gi en by mouth after a period free from 
oral or parenteral iron therapy According to 
some authors m the absence of hydrochloric 
acid in the stomach iron is absorbed poorly 
tlirough the gastrointestinal tract Collection 
of stools over the subsequent four days may 
help to evaluate the degree of absorption 
from the gastrointestinal tract One inter 
fering problem in this type of procedure Is 
decreased mobility of the gastrointestinal 
tract as a result of which the iron is not 
eliminated through the stool Consequently 
the amount excreted may be relatuely small 
in the first few days If the specimens on 
the fourth day contain more than 2 per cent 
of the giten dose additional stool speci 
mens should be collected o;er subsequent 
24 hour periods until the amount present is 
found to be below 2 per cent of the admin 
istered dose We have found that 10 to 20 
per cent of the iron Is absorbed in the gas 
trointesilnal tract by normal individuals 
The quantity found in the stools may be 
extremely low in patients with iron de 
ficiency anemia or with polycythemia vera 
Patients wlib adequate iron stores excrete 
80 to 90 per cent Those who have an excess 
of iron excrete more In the stool It is neccs 
sary to differentiate the individual who has 
enough iron from one whose intestinal ab- 
sorption IS deficient because of inadequate 
hydrocblonc acid in the stomach or defects 
of the intestinal mucosa 

Plasma Iron Disa/i/ earatice Time 

Tile study of plasma iron disappearance 
after injection of a known amount of radio- 
active iron ® allows one to determine the ap- 
proximate quantity of iron stores in the 
liodj A do*:c of 20 microcuries of Fe''* as 
ferrous citrate is incubated with a sample 
of the patJents plasma and then injected 
into the patient The Incubation period al 
lows for the tagging of the plasma with the 
iron and produces an iron protein fraction

According to some authors preliminary in 
cubation with the pauenis plasma is not 
necessary (Hallbcrg and Silvcll 39CO Lcn 
tino et al 1960) The injected iron is 
cleared from the plasma at a relatively 
rapid rate initially which gradually slows so 
that 50 per cent of the radioactive iron is 
removed from the plasma in 60 to 120 
minutes In individuals with an iron dc 
flcicncy in whom the iron stores are rcla 
lively small the clearance time is much 
more rapid According to some authors m 
individuals whose iron stores arc filled the 
absorption is much slower and may go on 
for days before the 50 per cent mark has 
been reached In accord with this concept 
Iron disappearance is a direct measurcmeiu 
of the iron stores of the body and not of 
any red cell activity 

On the other hand according to other 
authors iron clearance is accelerated in 
polycythemia the leukemias hemolytic anc 
mia pernicious anemia the anemias of 
infection (Bush Ashcnbrucker Cartwright 
and Wintrobe 1956) cancer and iron de- 
ficiency Plasma iron clearance is decreased 
in aplastic conditions of the bone marrow 
(Wasserman Rashkoff Leavitt and Port 
1956) TTiis rate of disappearance can be 
used as an index of erythropolesis provided 
the bodj stores of iron arc normil (Ram 
bach Cooper and Alt 1955)

rapid rate than normally while in patients 
tvith aplastic anemias the iron incorporation 
into the red cells is depressed and the curve 
is relatively flat from the beginmng Com

usually in the hver and spleen and in hyper 
splemsm the spleen wU have more of the

!•” In malabsorption syndromes both types 
of fats arc poorly absorbed whereas in pan 
crcatic disorders only the triolein is poorly 
absorbed while the oleic acid is absorbed 
normally 

The normal curve for fat absorption may 
be seen in the accompanying figure 

Hithin two hours approximately 0 5 to 
1 per cent per liter of the ingested dose is 
found in the blood and In four hours 2 5 to 
3 5 per cent after six hours the quantity 
present will be 2 to 3 per cent per liter 
Stool specimens from normal persons 
measured over a period of four days usu 
ally show Jess than 5 per cent of the lo 
gested dose This procedure is a more 
sensitive measure of malabsorption 

In performing this test it is wise to give 
the patient Lugols solution prior to the be 
ginning of the test to saturate the thyroid 
gland This will eliminate any absorption of 
into the thyroid as a result of the pro- 
cedure 

Errors may result from mechanical prob-

addition mechanical defects in the stomach 
preventing release of the meal into the m

Clinical Ckemistry 

By TERRIN B MORELAND, Ph D 


BASIC LABORATOR\ MANEUVERS 

Before descnbing the principles involved 
in the se\eral types of analyucal methods 
used m clinical chemistry u may be useful 
to consider some basic techniques and 
fundamentals that are important in any 
chemical procedure 

Weighing 

The amount of most chemicals to be 
used in the laboratory is measured by 
weight Liquids and gases are generally 
measured by volume but even these are 
sometimes weighed Some chemicals are 
weighed directly for immediate use Most 
often they are weighed and then put into 
solution so that the portion for actual use 
can be measured by volume Sometimes the 
weight must be known precisely at other 
times an approximate weight is all that is 
needed Accurate weighing lakes more tune 
and requires the use of expensive equip 
ment It is therefore important m each in 
stance to know how precisely the weighmg 
must be done 

Several types of weighing devices should 
be available m a clinical laboratory The 
most precise is the a n^ytical balance 
There are many kinds of analytical bal 
ances on the market They vary in accuracy 
sensitivity and convenience and their cost 
IS determined by these features For usual 
purposes an analytical balance should have 
a sensiUvity of about 1/20, of a milligram 
(0 05 mg or 0 00005 gm ) and a capacity 
of 'aBout 200 gm An analytical balance 
consists essentially of a beam balanced in 
the center on a Jciufe-edge with pans hung 


from the ends The pans are also suspended 
on knife edges to mimmize friction Ma 
terial to be weighed Is placed on one pan 
(usually the left) and weights are placed 
on the other (usually the right) To protect 
the delicate knife edges and the smooth 
surfaces on which they rest the balance is 
equipped with a mechanism for Lftmg the 
knife edges and stabilizing the beam when 
anything is being added to or removed from 
the pans or when the equipment is not m 
use It IS also necessary that the balance 
be enclosed m a case to protect it from 
dust and from air currents both of which 
would affect the apparent weight obtained 
The simplest and therefore least expensive 
type of analyucal balance requires the 
handling of weights on the right pan down 
to 10 mg Differences of less than 10 mg 
(someumes 5 mg ) are measured b> mo\ 
ing a “nder along graduations on the 
beam from 0 at the center knife edge to 
10 rog (or 5 mg ) over the knife edge of 
the right pan A httle more convenience is 
obtamed by adding graduations to the left 
side of the beam Weighing is made much 
faster hy suspending from the beam a fine 
hnk chain whose effective length can be 
vaned and whos“ weight can be read from 
a dial Such a chain usually covers a range 
up to 100 mg By eliminating the 10 mg 
rider from the beam a larger nder can 
used this IS set in notches to cover the 
range from 100 mg to I gm A “keyboard 
may be used to add and remove weights in 
the 10 to 1000 mg range Other conveni 
ences available mclude a magneuc damper 
to bnng the beam rapidly to rest and a 
mechamsm for easily adjusting the zero 
mdex to the actual zero point

Clinical Chemistry

It IS necessary to have an adequately 
accurate set of weights for use ivjth an 
analytical balance There is no point In try 
ing to iveigli to an accuracy of 0 2 rag 
with weights that are accurate only to 0 1 
gra For use mth the analytical balance a 
set of weights of at least Class S of the 
National Bureau of Standards classification 
should be available Class C weights are 
useful for rough balances iveighlng to no 
better than 0 1 gm 

An analytical balance Is used for weigh 
mg standards and for a feiv components 
of reagents For weighing most of the 
chemicals used in the preparation of dim 
cal laboratory reagents less preaslon is 
needed and a less expensne but more 
rapid type of balance should be available 
The least expensive type of balance for this 
purpose IS the trip balance which may have 
one or two platforms or pans This type of 
balance may have one or more beams with 
movable nders or weights on them to 
avoid the use of loose weights on the right 
pan When working properly this type of 
balance is sensitive to about 0 1 gm One 
defect of this type of balance is its tendency 
to shift us zero point When either end of 
the beam touches bottom the zero point 
is likely to shift in that direction and make 
accurate weighing difficult 

A more stable and accurate instrument is 
the torsion balance it is also much more 
expensive than a trip balance A good 
compromise which combines a sensitivity 
of about 0 01 gm and a moderate price is 
the triple beam type of balance (Fig 8-1) 

The two most important considerations 
in the use of any balance are cleanliness 



Figure 8-1 Tnple beam balance (Courtesy Ohaus 
Scale Corp ) 


and gentleness With the more sensitive 
analytical balances the weight of ^ger 
pnnts may be appreciable Also the mois 
ture and salt from fingers may cause cor 
TOsion Anything that is weighed on an 
analytical balance should be handled with 
a forceps or clean gauze Weights should 
be handed with special precautions using 
forceps of soft metal or with ivory tips 
Never place a chemical directly on the pan 
of a biUance On the analytical balance use 
a vvatch glass or weighing bottle to contain 
the chemical For rough weighing of inert 
chemicals paper can be used to protect the 
pans from direct contact Any spilled 
chemicals should be cleaned away at once 

The process of weighing is always rela 
ove The final weight is no more accurate 
than the initial zeroing of the balance 
This zero balancing must include the 
weighing paper or vessel or these must be 
weighed separately and a proper allowance 
made for them The weight of a sheet of 
paper is usually not negligible Do not as 
sume that a balance will read zero with 
nothmg on it It usually will not Most bal 
ances have adjustable weights mounted on 
screws which can be turned one way or 
the other to bring the empty reading to 
zero Some balances axe zeroed by adjustmg 
the screws of their feet Another way to zero 
is to add weights to one pan or the other 
umU balance is attained and then to add 
or subtract this extra weight from the final 
weight 

Mixing 

Directions to mix are frequently omitted 
from laboratory mstructions because it is 



Fiffure 8-2 Mixing by vttJjI flipping

second nature to experienced worlds and 
therefore taken for granted There are cer 
tarn layering tests in which careful avoid 
ance of mixing is important but these are 
rather excepuonal Unless othermse speci 
fled whenever two solutions are put to- 
gether or when a sohd or liquid reagent 
is added to another, always mux preferably 
(and sometimes necessarily) after each of 
a senes of additions 

The most obvious method of mixing is 
to stopper and shake This is also one of 
the most effective There are several other 
ways to mix and a suitable one will be 
selected for the circumstances One of the 
most useful is the flipping technique which 
is done by holding the test tube between 



the thumb and first finger and flipping up 
and down with a wnst action (Fig S-2) 
(Practice this techraque first with a test 
tube of waterl) Another method parucu 
larly useful for stimng up sohd material 
in the bottom of a lube, is to hold the tube 
tightly between the thumb and forefinger 
of one hand and to rapidly strike the bot 
tom of the tube with the four fingers of 
the other hand in succession (Fig 8^) 
There are also available commeraallj 
eral types of tube .m ixin g devic es or tuw 
buzzers (Figs 8-4, 8-5) These can be 
very useful For prolonged stimng as in 
dissolving a sohd in a liquid mechanical 
stimng IS best Many types of sdrrers «ec- 
tnc or air driven are on the market Per 
haps the most useful is the magnetic stirrer 
in which a motor driven magnet drives a 


Ci.tNi(i\u Chemistry 


second magnet placed In the beaker or 
flask to be stirred. Stirring magnets encased 
In glass or plastic arc available. A combina- 
tion hot plate-magnetic stirrer is a useful 
piece of equipment.

Getting solids Into solution can waste a 
lot of lime. There are a few tricks to help 
speed the process, but the best approach 
is to do something else uhilc (he dissolving 
is going on. Watching docs not help. 

Use may lx? made of a mechanical stir- 
rer. such as a magnetic mbccr. Heat also 
helps If the material Involved Is heat stable. 
Heat affects solubility in two ways: It 
speeds the dissolving process, and .ns a rule 
it increases .solubility. If heat is used in 
preparing a saturated solution, it Is some- 
times possible to dissolve more than will 
remain in solution at room temperature. 
This may result In an undeslraiite excess 
of solid or even n broken bottle when the 
solution cools. 

Some materials arc readily soluble but 
may become dlfllcuU to dissolve if not 
properly handled. Anhjdrous sodium car- 
bonate is one of these. The powder should 
be phneed in a dry beaker or flask and the 
water suddenly added from another open 
vessel. With Immediate shaking, solution 
is rapid. If the powder is allowed to get wet 
bf/WT j| Js ihakrn ihorougMy with water, 
it may cake and dissolve only very slowly. 

Another method to speed solution in- 
volves getting (he solid up off (he bottom. 
A-s the material on the bottom dissolves. It 
forms a saturated solution, which then pre- 
vents further dissolving ontJJ it diffuses op 
into the more dilute solution above. A per- 
forated cone or test tube can be set in the 
top of a cjllndcr, which is filled with sol- 
vent. Solid placed in the cone or tube is 
then immersed fn the top of the liquid and 


389 

dissolves rapidly as the heavier solution is 
formed and streams downward. Another 
simple trick Is to use a glass stopper cyl- 
inder with solvent and solid in it. The 
cylinder Is inverted to let the solid settle 
to the top (Fig. 8-G). U is then carefully 
turned part way back, leaving the solid near 
the top just bclotv the liquid level. Rapid 
solution results. 


nUratiott 

Filtration and ccntriftigatlon arc used to 
separate solids from liquids. Filtration is 
usualty done through pai>cr but may some- 
times better be done through cloth, cotton, 
or glass wool, especially when rapid filtra- 
tion Is desired. Common sense should sug- 
gest the filter medium, depending on the 
sire and character of the solid particles 
being removed and on the chemical activ- 
ity of the liquid. Filter papers arc available 
in many tyi>es and degrees of porosity 
(Table ft-I). Papers of low mineral or 
•ash" content— relatively expensive papers 
—arc needed for only such special de- 
terminations as calcium or phosphate. Frit- 
ted glass filters, though fairly expensive, 
arc scry useful and do not add paper fibers 
to the filtrate. Suction, properly applied, 
may speed filtration: it U usually used with 
fitted glass filters. Sometimes the first po^ 
tion of a filtrate Is cloudy. It can often be 
cleared by rcfilicxing through the same 
paper when the precipitate itself acts as 
an additional filtering medium. 

Centn'/ugntion 

CcnlrifugatlDn Js frequently roorc satis- 
factory than filtration for separating a solid 
from a liquid. It avoids possible contamina- 
tion by tbe paper and usually yields a 
larger volume than filtration. Centrifuga 
don docs not always produce clear solu-

There are various sizes and types of cen 
tnfuges on the market The effecmencss of 
a centnfuge (i e the centrifugal force de 
1 eloped) depends an the speed of rotation 
and on the distance of the sample from the 
center of rotation The instruction to spin 
at for example 2000 rpm (reiolutions 
per minute) is indefinite The effect inlJ 
be greater in a large centnfuge than in a 
small one at the same speed At 2000 rpm 
a tube placed with its contents 4 inches 
from the axis will develop a force 454 times 
that of gravity at 8 mches the force will be 
double or 908 x g In other words to de 
velop a centrifugal force of 400 g a tube 
4 inches from the center would have to 
spm at 1880 rpm a tube 8 inches from 
the center would require only 1330 rpm 
The centnfugal force increases in direct 
proportion to the distance from the center 
of rotation but mcreases as the square of 
the speed Therefore doubling the speed 
of a centnfuge is far more effective than 
doubling Its size This is expressed in the 
formula RCF = kn"* RCF is relative cen 
mfugal force r is the radius or distance 
from the center of rotation \ is velocity m 
rev olutions per nunute and k Is 0 0000284 


when r is m mches or 0 0000112 when r 
IS in centimeters 

Some centnfuges aliovv the tubes to 
swing out honzontally as they spm some 
hold the tubes at a fixed angle The former 
arrangement leads to a flat upper surface 
of the sedimented solid layer the laiier 
leaves the solid surface at an angle Since 
the angle centnfuge has less air resistance 
than the swinging cups it develops more 
speed for the same motor power 

Owing to the great force developed In 
the centnfuge all rotating parts must be 
balanced carefully to prevent vabration 
which may damage the machine and be a 
senous hazard to the people around it Al 
ways place cups and tubes m the centn 
fuge in pairs opposite one another Tubes 
are paired for equal weight A nearly empty 
tube must not be opposite a nearly full one 
If necessary put in extra tubes filled v^b 
a suitable amount of water to equalize odd 
tubes For high speeds the opposite cups 
must be even more carefully balanced b> 
setting them with the metal tube and trun 
mon carrier on a two-pan tnp balance ana 
adding or removing flmd until they balance 
This balancing can be with fluid within tne 
tube or with water in the space between 
the glass and metal tubes Never use mcr

Pipets Pipets may be graduated at one 
point or at many they may be calibrated 
to contain or to dehver They may be caJi 
brated to deliver by drainage or by having 
the last drop blown out They may be call 
brated to deliver to the tip or to some 
other base above the tip 

The so-called measuring nipcts Include 
serologic and Mohr pipets (Fig 8-7) 
These diifer from one another in that the 
serologic pipets arc calibrated to the tip 
whereas the Mohr cahbraiion stops above 
the constricted portion For special appli 
cations there arc modifications of these 
with large bore tips or with long thin tips 


391 


All these pipets arc graduated at intervals 
so they can be used for measuring odd 
volumes or for dispensing several samples 
from one filling Tliere may be inaccuracies 
in the Intermediate calibrations owing to 
variations in the inside diameter of the 
pipet Only the total volume not the inter 
mediate points is checked in manufacture 
Most moasunng pipets that are gradu 
ated to the tip arc calibrated for blowout 
The Folm Wu pipct however is caUbraied 
for drainage only Most manufacturers 
mark pipets that are to be blown out with

measure tbeir volume xntfre accuTale\'y than 
t He measuring~pipets i'hey are calibrate 
to deliver by drainage with the tip touching 
the side of the receiving vessel as they 
empty This procedure leaves a drop of the 
same size m the tip each time For most 
accurate measuring the tip should be 
constncted so that the liquid draining from 
the walls of the pipet keeps up with the 
bulk of the fluid as it drains out This 
makes dehvery slow A good compromise 
is to use a pipet with a somewhat larger 
bore at the tip Let it dram freelj until the 
liquid is at ^e bottom of the bulb then 
partially close the top of the pipet to assure 
slow final dramage Kimble states, how 
ever that their pipets are cabbrated for 
unrestncted delivery and no wait 

A commonly used modification of this 
single-calibration pipet is the Ostw aid Folin 
pipet This has a bulb placed low on the 


Bv Laboratorv Methods 

pipet and is cabbrated for blowout rather 
than merely for dramage This makes it 
somewhat more accurate for use with more 
viscous liquids, such as blood 

Two modifications of these pipets are 
useful m handling samples for anal>sis in 
the Van Slyke blood gas apparatus One 
change is the addition of a second mark 
below the bulb, delivery of the calibrated 
volume IS between the two marks The 
other alteration is the addition of a stop- 
cock to control dehvery of the sample 
The pipets we have discussed so far have 
been c^brated “to deliver,” some to deliver 
by drainage and some by blowout In addi 
tion to these, there are also pipets cabbrated 
“to contam IVhen full, the *to debver" 
pipets which have the letters “TD” marked 
on them, contam a larger amount than do 

cause the former contain not only the cab 
brated volume that they will dehver but 
also the bqmd that will remain wetting 
the inside of the pipet when dehvery is 
finished In order to get the full cabbrated 
volume out of a ‘TC” pipet, it must be 
nnsed Usually these pipets are of small 
volume and rmsin g increases the accurac) 
of dehvery, especially of viscous bquids 
such as blood The 20 microbter hemo- 
globin pipet and the 0 1 ml Folin micro- 
blood sugar pipet are of tlus type 

Pasteur pipets are useful for transfemns 
sm^ volumes of bqmd, for separating 
serum, and so on They are made by draw 
mg a piece of glass tubmg out with a long 
up and are used with a rubber medicine 
dropper bulb They are av^able from lab- 
oratory suppbers as disposable pipets 
The me of fitpeis The pipets vfe have 
been describing are normally filled by sue 
Don This IS usually done by mouth If the 
fluid being pipetted is toxic or offensive 
another source of suction ma> be used 
A plain rubber bulb may be used to draw 
up the bquid it is then quickly slipped off 
and the pipet controlled by finger as usual 
There are also several special types of rul^ 
bet bulbs with valves which are designed 
for controlbng pipets Of these the Pumpet 
IS easily handled, being designed for one 
hand operation (either right or left) h 
requires however, a sensitive touch u 
you have good dextenty you should like 
it Another, which Is easier to control is 
the Propipette 

In addition to these do it yourself pip«ts 
there are a number of automatic ones

Sehgson (1957) has described another 
device for measuring samples and diluent 
or reagent eliminating the use of a pipet 
and volumetric flask It consists of the 
pipet A a calibrated tube B and a trap 
C (Fig 8-9) Suction is applied at the 
trap Suction may be provided by a fish 
tank aerator which has been made to suck 
air by a slow running water pump or by 
a rubber bulb To operate the automatic 
pipet the sample often in the tube in 
which It was collected is placed under the 
pipet tip Tlie sample is drawn up slowly 
until It reaches the elbow entering the trap 
The stopcock is turned 90® clockwise to 
lock the desired volume of sample in the 
pipet The tip is wiped the reaction vessel 
or test tube cuvet is placed under the tip 
and the stopcock is turned another 90® 
clockwise This allows reagent or diluent 
in the calibrated tube to flow through the 
pipet and flush out the contents of the tip 
The volume of reagent can be adjust^ 
to make a desired dilution of sample IVhen 
a suitable volume of reagent has passed 
through the pipet the stopcock is turned 
90® clockwise to Its original position the 
tip wiped and the operation repeated with

a new sample As the new sample ascends 
the pipet it moves the film of reagent 
ahead of xt and by the time the sample 
reaches the elbow entering the trap the 
pipet contains the new sample uncon 
laminated with reagent The operation is 
continued with as many samples as de 
sired The pipet is most convenient and 
accurate when used with 0 1 to 0 2 ml 
volumes but has been used effectively with 
volumes ranging from 0 02 to 1 50 ml 
Burets A buret is like a measuring pipet 
but has a stopcock for easy accurate con 
trol of delivery As with measuring pipets 
the accuracy of the intermediate marks 
cannot be assumed without checking un 
less precision bore burets are used As with 
pipets calibration can be done by weighing 
water dehvered between marks and calcu 
latxng the volume from the specific gravity 
of water at that temperature 

Several conveniences can be built into 
burets One is a two way stopcock to allow 
easy refilling of the buret from a reservoir 
Another is an automatic zero arrangement 
at the top One of the best advances m 
burets is the use of Teflon instead of glass 
for stopcocks These need no grease as 
glass cocks do and so avoid the troublesome 
fouling of the inside of buret barrel and 
tip Also they do not freeze when allowed 
to stand for some time with alkaline solu 
tfons Teflon cocks are available in the 
same general design as glass ones they 
have however a steeper taper and the 
barrel surface is specially finished 
A buret is most conveniently handled as 
shown in Fig 8-10 an Erlenmeyer flask 
allows effective continuous mixing by swirl 
mg as the tilrant is added from the buret

are useful for volume measurements that 
do not have to be very precise As with 
other graduated ware, the total volume is 
probably quite accurate but intermediate 
points are less reliable Measurements in 
the lower portion give increasingly larger 
percentage errors The size of cylinder used 
should be chosen so that the volume 
measured occupies a considerable portion 
of the cyhnder Do not use a 100 ml 
cylinder to measure 1 or 2 ml Mixing cyl 
inders are glass stopper, graduated cylin 
ders They are particularly useful for 
making solutions and dilutions 

Volumetric Flasks Volumetric flasks, hke 
volumetric pipets, are precision measuring 
instruments The most accurate dilutions 
are made with these two pieces of equip- 
ment Two problems ansmg with vol 
umetnc flasks rmght be mentioned The 
first is getting a weighed amount of solid 
into the flask in making up a solution It 
IS difficult to transfer material from a watch 
glass into the neck of a flask without spill 
ing even the transfer from a weighing 
paper is hazardous The best procedure is 
to transfer the solid to a beaker and dis 
solve It and then to pour the solution into 
the flask, nnsing in the final traces Water 
IS added only until the solution is somewhat 
below the neck of the flask so that by swirl 
mg the solid can be completely dissolved 
and well mixed Water is finally added 
until the bottom of the meniscus is on the 
calibration mark The next problem is to 
mix the solution thoroughly so that It will 
be of uniform concentration throughout 
This requires inversion of the flask shak 
ing renghting it so that the bubble comes 
back to the top and repeatmg this process 
15 or 20 times 

Chemicals 

Just because a bottle is labeled "Sodium 
Clilonde” does not mean that there is not 
even a small amount of sulfate iodide, or 
potassium in it Punty of chemicals is a 
matter of degree For any chemical test we 
want to be sure that there is not enough 
of any other substance in the chemicals 
used to give an abnormal leacuon In a 
quantitative test we want to know exactly 
how much of the desired compound there is 
m the standard For these reasons we usu 
ally use “reagent grade” chemicals These 
are more expensive than less carefully 
purified grades of chemicals By using 
judgment one can sometimes save money 
without loss of accuracy However, the 


difference in cost is usually not enough to 
risk a poor result, and it Is better to use the 
best grade when there is any doubt 

Several grades of chemicals are avail 
able Time was when the term “CP” or 
“chemically pure’ designated the best avail 
able However, some distnbutors started 
marking their chemicals 'reagent grade” or 
“analytical grade " These terms are now 
widely used for the most highly punfied 
chemicals, and “CP" may designate a 
grade sbghtly less pure The Araencan 
Chemical Society has established standards 
of punty for many chemicals any that 
meet these requirements may be labeled 
"ACS’ Several suppliers hst m their cata 
logs or on the label the maximum limits 
of impunties in their chemicals Two com 
panics, J T Baker and Fisher, put the 
actual analysis on the label so that one 
can tell exactly how much of an impurity 
is present m a particular bottle This is 
frequently of help 

Other grades of punty are “USP” and 
"NF,’ which mean that these chemicals 
meet the tests listed in the United States 
Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary 
these grades are good enough for human 
consumption but may not be pure enoueli 
for some chemical purposes ‘Techmcal* 
and “purified” are less pure grades 

Sometimes even reagent grade chemicals 
contain far less than 100 per cent of the 
named compound The maximum limits of 
unpunues may show only very small allow 
ances, but the chemical may still contain 
a large amount of some other, sometimes 
unmentioned impunty If the "assay" is 
given this may help Look at the label on 
a bottle oi sodium hydroxide Note that 
the sum of the allowable impurities in 
eluding a considerable amount of carbon 
ate, does not equal the difference betvfecn 
the assay for sodium hydroxide and 100 
per cent In this particular case the differ 
ence is largely water In other cases it may 
be something more important For example 
“molybdic acid’ contains about 15 per cent 
ammonia, this is undesirable for certain 
tests in clinical chemistry, and the pure 
“molybdenum trioxide” must be used in 
stead Also “metaphosphonc add” contains 
about 60 per cent sodium metaphosphate 

Another important consideration in the 
use of chemicals is the degree of hydrat on 
or the amount of water of crystalUzation 
they contain Sometimes the anhydrous 
compound is stable, someumes it has sue 
an avadJty for water that it cannot 
weighed accurately It then becomes ncc 



Clinical CiiFMisrRV 


395 


sary to use a stable hydrate of t?ie com- 
pound. For example, copper sulfate fs 
weighed as its pcntahydratc. Sometimes a 
salt exists in more than one degree of 
hydration; thus, disodium hydrogen phos- 
phate is available as the dodccahydratc. the 
heptahydrate, and the dihydrate, as well 
as the anhydrous form (Na.HP 04 • 12H«0, 
Na-IlPO, • 7I1;0, Na^HPOi • 21hO. and 
Na JlPO^). The dihydratc is the most stable 
and is preferable for weighing. Naturally It 
will take more of the hydrate than of the 
anhydrous salt to give a staled amount of 
phosphate. If Instructions call for a differ- 
ent hydrate than the one you wish to use, 
you can calculate the required amount by 
multiplying the stated amount by the ratio 
of the molecular weights of the two forms. 
Thus, if 12 gm. of NajIlPO, • 12H ,0 (mol. 
wi, 358) is called for and you wish to use 
Na-llPO, • 2 II 2 O (mol. wt. 178), you would 
take 

Usually the concentration of a solution is 
expressed In terms of the anhydrous salt. 
However, for some compounds that arc 
available only as the hydrate, the percent- 
age is of the hydrate. Thus. 10 per cent 
sodium tungstate solution is traditionally 
made by dissolving 10 gm. of Na^WO,- 
2 HsO in water and diluting to 100 ml. 

In order for a chemist to know what Is 
going on In a reaction and to be able to 
anticipate or evaluate abnormal reactions 
or interferences, he should know what 
compounds he is using in a determination. 
This would preclude the use of proprietary 
reagents of undisclosed composition. There 
are several of these on the market for pro- 
tein precipitation, for urine preservation, 
and for the determination of cholesterol, 
for example. Although these may give good 
results under normal conditions, there is 
no way to predict what may happen with 
an abnormal specimen. 

Exfiressiiif' Cottcerilratiort 

There arc several methods In use in 
clinical chemistry for expressing the con- 
centration of solutions. The simplest and 
most common is percenta ge. There are, 
however, several ways to express percent- 
age. One is to express per cent in grams 
of solute per 100 ml of solution; this, 
ordinarily the most useful. Is “per cent 
weight per volume'' or "% (w/v)” and is 
meant if no other basis is expressed; it is 
the definition used in the U. S. Pharma- 


copoeia. Another basis is grams of solute 
per 100 gm. of solution; this is "% (wt.)" 
and Is more used than useful. It is, for ex- 
ample, the basis on which concentrated 
sulfuric acid is said to be 96 per cent; i.c., 
100 gm. of solution contains 96 gm, of 
II-SOj. Since this solution has a specific 
gravity of 1,84. 100 gm. occupies a volume 
of 100/1.84 or 54.3 ml. It therefore con- 
tains 96 gm. of lUSO^ in 54.3 ml., or 177 
gm, of 112804 per 100 ml., and is 177 per 
cent (w/v). 

A common error in using the term “per 
Cent" fs to use ft to mean per cent of con- 
centrated without saying so. For example, 
a solution made by diluting 10 ml. of con- 
centrated hydrochloric acid to 100 ml. is 
sometimes called 10 per cent hydrochloric 
acid. Actually, since concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid is a 44 per cent (w/v) solu- 
tion, the tenfold dilution is only a 4.4 per 
cent solution. One must read the instruc- 
tions in making the solution in order to be 
sure what is meant and then label the 
solution so that other people using it will 
also know how It was made 

Another use of "per cent” Is to designate 
“per cent saturated." This is usually the 
ratio of the volume of water added to the 
volumes of the water plus the saturated 
solution limes 100. Thus, if 100 ml. of 
water is added to 100 ml. of saturated 
ammonium sulfate, the resulting solution is 
colled 50 per cent saturated. If the solute 
is a liquid, we may express percentage on 
a volume basis as milliliters of solute per 
100 ml. of solution or per cent (v/v). 

Another method of expressing dilution is 
sometimes used and is liable to misinterpre- 
tation. This is use of the expression "dilute 
the solution one to three” or "a 1:3 dilu- 
tion.” This could mean either “dilute one 
volume to three volumes" or “dilute one 
volume with three volumes of ivater." The 
expression 1 ; 1 can of course mean only 
“dilute one volume with one volume;” the 
expression 1:100 is usually taken to mean 
“dilute one volume to 100 volumes.” The 
directions for making the solutions may 
clarify the meaning, but they frequently 
do not. It would be preferable to use the 
unambiguous term 1 -f 3 or 1 — i 3. 

For v^ry dilute solutions we may express 
the concentration in milligrams (mg.) or 
mlcrograms (y, ^g., or meg.; not ug.) of 
solute per 100 ml, of solution and thus 
have mg. per cent or meg. per cent. These 
terms are frequently used to express con- 
centration of certain constituents in blood. 
For even smaller concentrations we may 



39G Clinic \L Diagnosis b\ 

occasionally need to use nanograms (ng 
0 001 meg ) or picograms (pg 0 001 ng ) 
To compare solutions on the basis 
amounts that %vill react chemically we 
must have another basis than per cent 
For this purpose we express concentration 
as molaniy or equivalence A molar (M) 
solution contains one gram molecular 
weight in one liter An equiv alent or normal 
(N) solution contams one gram-equivalent 
per liter or one mole divided by the valence 
of the multivalent ion or bj the number of 
monovalent ions m the molecule Thus for 
sodium hydroxide (m vv 40) a molar solu 
tion and a normal solution are both 40 
gm /I or 4 per cent For sulfunc acid 
(m vv 98) a molar solution contams 98 
gm /I and a normal solution 49 gm /I 
Solutions one thousandth as strong as these 
are expressed as millimolar (mM ) or mil 
liequiv alent (mEq ) In some cases we are 
interested in the number of milhequiva 
lents in a volume other than one bter We 
therefore commonly use the sjrnbol mEq 
to mean one miUiequivalent (one thou 
sandth of an equivalent weight) rather 
than a concentration of one thousandth 
normal For the latter we say mEq /bter 
To convert from mg per cent to mEq /I 
muluply by the valence divide by the 
molecular or atomic weight and muluply 
b 5 10 The 10 is necessary to convert from 
the basis of 100 ml to 1 bter To convert 
from vol per cent to mEq /I divide by 
the molecular volume (22 3 for CO.) and 
muluply by 10 For protein and for phos 
phace the effective valence vanes with pH

uon At the normal pH of blood 7 4 the 
cRective valence oS phosphate is 1 8 To

Calculating Concentration There are two 
t)p>es of calculations that are frequently 
made involving volume and concenlrauon 
of solutions One is m the preparation of 
a dilution from a stronger soluuon The 
other IS in calculating the concentration of 
a solution by knowing how much of it will 
react exactlj with a known volume of 
another solution of known concentrauon 
The first of these two tjpes of calculauons 
can be made readily if concentrations are 
expressed in normabtj or in per cent 
weight for volume The second type of 
calculation can be made with concentra 
tion in normality Both are based on the 
obvious fact that as we increase the volume 
of a portion of a solution we proportion 
ally decrease its concentration QuanUta 


Laboratorv Methods 

uvely this is expressed by the statement 
that the volume times the concentration of 
one solution equals the volume tunes the 
concentration of an equivalent solution 

V,N, = V 2 N 2 or 
rrY-*!! (for per cent tw/v]) 

We wiU use the first expression a bttle 
later in calculaung the results of titrauons 
We also use it and the second equation in 
making dilutions Thus if we have a 25 
normal solution of sodium hydroxide and 
want to make a bter of 0 1 N solution we 
can calculate the volume to take 

VjN, = V-N- 
X X 2 5 = 1000 X 0 1 


2 5x = 100 



or 40 ml of 2 5 N sodium hydroxide diluted 
to 1 bter with water will give us a 01 N 
solution 

Similarly, to make a bter of 70 per cent 
alcohol from 95 per cent alcohol we could 
calculate 

XX 95= 1000 X 70 
7n 

x= 1000 x^=737 

If we dilute 737 ml of 95 per cent alcohol 
to 1 bter with water, the result v^ill be 
70 per cent alcohol 

A special case of this formula is fre- 
qxienlly he)p!u) iTHerchange vVie volume 
of one solution for the concentration of 
the other and vice versa Thus 70 ml of 
95 per cent alcohol will make 95 ml of 
70 per cent (and therefore 700 ml of 93 
per cent wall make 950 ml of 70 per cent) 
Or 0 1 ml of 2 5 N sodium hydroxide will 
make 2 5 ml of 0 1 N (therefore 10 ml 
of 2 5 N will make 250 ml of 0 1 N)

laboratories still measure the excreuo n of 
hippunc acid following a dose of sodium 
benzoate by isolating and weighing it The 
minera l content of bone can be determ ined 
by ashing and weighing BesicfeThe removal 
of insoluble compounds^ soluble substance 
may be remo\ed by extracuon tvith a 
solvent The sol\ent can be remo\ed by 
evaporation and the residue purified and 
weighed This techmque is commonly used 
for the determination of fecal fat 

One other application of ireighing is w 
the determination of specific gra\ity which 
is weight per unit \olume or grams per 
millili ter This determinaUon can be done 
by measuring a knotvn Yolume Into a stop- 
pered weighing bottle or into a beaher 
under a layer of oil (to retard ctaporauon) 
and weighmg on an analytical balance Or 
the liquid may be weighed directly in the 
pipet This technique is valuable for 
amounts of sample too small to use with 
a hy drom eter Most commonly specific 
grasTty is determined with a hydrometer 
a float tmh a long stem that carries a cab 
brated scale The hydrometer floats low 
or high in the liquid depending on the 
specific gravity It can be used to measure 
the concentration of alcohol to indicate 
how much charge there is In a storage 
battery or to indicate the amount of dis 
sohed solids in urme This last application 
IS the common one in the chmeal labora 
tory using a hydrometer adapted to the 
specific gravity range of unne In the use 
of a hydrometer several precautions must 
be observed The hydrometer must be 
checked for accuracy at least at one pomt 
especially if it is the tvpe with an enclosed 
paper scale which may shp A unnometer 
can be checked in distilled water The lem 
peraturc of the sample must be the same 
as that of the cahbration of the hvdromeler 
or a correction factor must be apphed The 
hydrometer must float freely not being 
in contact with the side of the vessel 
There must be no bubbles clinging to the 
hydrometer These two requirements may 
be met by giving the float a spin as It is 
put into the hquid

The amount of a substance in solution 


can be determined by measunng the 
amount of a solution of known concentra 
lion that reacts with a measured amount 
of the unknowTi solution These methods 
which are familiar to every student who 
has had a didactic course in quantitative 
analytical chemistry involve intelligent 
selection and use of vvell-cahbrated \ol 
umemc glassware— volumetnc flasks pi 
pets and burets Standard volumetnc solu 
txons are prepared by very accurate weigh 
mg of specially purified chemicals Indica 
tors must be chosen that will show when 
the equivalence point has been reached 
There are several types of volumetnc de 
terminations in use m chnical chemlstrv

Acidimetby 

AcitUmetry mvolving titration of an 
a cid and a base is used m eastn^li^ysir 
for determining the amount of HCl in gas 
tnc juice It IS also used in some laborato- 
nes for the determination of scrum bicar 
bonate and for the fractionauon of fecal 
hpid into free fatty acid and neutral fat 
Two requisites for acidimetry are a stand 
ard solution of exactly known concentra 
uon and a suitable mdicator for signahns 
the endpoint of the titration Tlie com 
roonly used acids and alkalis (h;i^ochlonc 
acid,, sulfuric acid,, nitric acid sodium by 
d roxid e potassium hydroxide ammo nium 
hydroxid e) are not suitalile for primary 
standards since they cannot be purified 
so that we can know exactly vvhat we are 
weighing The acids listed and ammonium 
hydroxide are solutions in water sodium 
and potassium hydroxide arc solids but 
have such a strong affinity for both water 
and carbon dioxide that they cannot be 
weighed accurately There is a way in which 
hydrochlonc aad can be used as a primary 
standard since it forms a constant boiling 
mixture at about a 20 per cent concentra 
Uon By distillation of a solution and collec 
tion of the final constant boiling portion 
a solution of accurately known composition 
can be obtained This will vary vidth the 
barometric pressure From this portions 
may be weighed to make standard solutions 
of desired concentration A simpler pro- 
cedure is to make a standard solution from 
a solid acid or acid salt One of the mMt 
suitable compounds is potassium acl

For a somewhat higher price the compound

is used, the solution will lie exactly 1 N; it

Prefiarntion and ttandardtutlion of 
sodhtm hydroxide solution. In many appli- 
cations It Is necessary or preferable that 
the sodium hydroxide solution be carbon- 
ate free. Owing to the presence of carbon 
dioxide in the air and the avidity of sodium 
hydroxide for It, tills cannot be attained 
without some special precautions. The first 
step is to prepare a concentrated sodium 
hydroxide solution in which c.irbon3tc is 
soluble. After the earbonsie has seiilcd, 
the clear, carbonaie-frce supernatant Is 
diluted with freshly boiled and cooled dis- 
tilled water. The solution is permitted only 
minimum contact with air. It Is stored in 
a bottle equipped with a soda Umc tube. If 
the solution is to be used for titration, the 
bottle is conveniently attached to a buret 
by a siphon; the buret should also be 
equipped with a soda hme tube at the lop. 

If it is not important that the solution 
be carbonate free, it can be made directly 
from solid; in this case, weigh out about 
5 per cent excess to allow for carbonate 
and water in the hydroxide. Even if carbon- 
ate content is unimportant, it is usually 
more convenient to use a stock concen- 
trated solution to make up dilute solutions. 
The normality of the stock can be deter- 
mined by titration; this will speed up mak- 
ing of solutions of approximate concentra- 
tions. 

Preparation of Concentrated So- 
dium Hydroxide (50 per cent by 
Weiout). To 1 liter of water in a 2- or 3- 
liter borosillcate glass (Kimax or Pjtcx) 
flask In a sink (there is nothing worse to 


399 

spill than hot concentrated alkali), add 
1100 gm. of sodium hydroxide, or to 410 
ml. of water add 1 pound of sodium hy- 
droxide. Mix while the solid is being added 
so that it will not cake. The solution will 
get very hot. Let cool. Transfer to a bottle 
and let stand a few days for the carbonate 
to settle. 

When the normality of the dilute sodium 
hydroxide has been determined, as wall be 
described, calculate back to find out the 
normality of the concentrated solution and 
mark this on the bottle. This value will be 
helpful in preparing dilutions,- the e.xact 
normality of the dilution should, however, 
be checked. Make tliis back calculation, 
using the formula VtN, = V.N,. Taking the 
concentrated sodium hydroxide as solution 
J and the dilution as solution 2, this might, 
for example, work out as 

5.9xs= 1000 X 0.113 


or the concentrated sodium hydroxide is 
19.2 N. 

Preparation of Dilute Sodium Hy- 
droxide (0.1 N or I N). If the nonnality of 
the concentrated sodium hydroxide has not 
been determined, measure out 5.9 ml. of 
the concentrated solution (do not pipet by 
mouth; use a rubber bulb) and dilute It to 
JOO ml with water (freshJy boiled and 
cooled if a carbonate-free solution is de- 
sired) to make a 1 N solution; dilute 5 9 ml. 
of concentrated sodium hydroxide to 1 liter 
for 0.1 N solution. If the normality of the 
concentrated solution is known, calculate 
the volume to be used from the formula 
V,Ni = V-N-. Taking the concentrated so- 
dium hydro.xidc as solution 1 and the dilu- 
tion as solution 2, the formula might, for 
example, work out as 

X X 17 = 100 X I, or X X 17 = 1000 X 0.1 


Therefore, 5.9 ml. of concentrated sodium 
hydroxide diluted to 100 ml. would give a 
1 N solution and diluted to 1000 ml. would 
give a 0.1 N solution; or 59 ml. of concen- 
trated sodium hydroxide would make 1000 
ml. of 1 N solution. Store in a polyethylene 
or borosilicate glass (Pyrex or Kimax) bot- 
tle vvith a rubber or plastic stopper.

the acid solution as the endpoint is ap- 
proached the pink will disappear more 
slowly as this occurs decrease the rate 
at which the alkali is added The endpoint 
IS the first pmk you can see that remains 
for 15 seconds after mixing Read the buret 
before and after the titration and subtract 
to obtain the ml of NaOH used Calculate 
the concentration of the sodium hydroxide 
from the formula

or calculate the titer or factor for the 
sodium hydroxide The “factor” is the num 
ber by which the nominal or approximate 
normality is mulupbed to obtain the exact 
normality With this procedure 


f of NaOH = 


10

If It is desired to adjust the sodium bydrox 
ide to exact normality the amount of 
water to be added to each 10 ml of alkah 
IS the difference m the volume of NaOH 
used in the utration and 10 ml Thus for 
example if 9 6 ml of NaOH solution was 
required to titrate 10 ml of acid add 
10—96 ml =04 ml for each 10 ml If 
you have 980 ml of solution add 98 x 0 4 
= 39 ml of water Then recheck by titra 
tion 

Prel?aration of dilute hydrochloric acid 
(0 I T>, or 1 N) If an approximately 0 1 or 
I N soluUon is desired for use as such add 
105 ml of water to 10 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid for 1 N or add I liter of 
water to 8 8 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chlonc acid for 0 1 N If you are using an 
analyzed brand of bydrochlonc acid such 
as J T Baker you can calculate more 
closely the amount of hydrochloric acid to 
dilute by first calculatmg the normality of 
the concentrated hydrochloric acid from 
the data on the label 


To calculate the amount to be used to make

Dilution of 8 3 ml of concentrated HCI to 
100 ml with water or addition of 111 ml 
of water to 10 ml of concentrated acid 
would give an approximately 1 N soluuon 
A similar calculauon could be made for 
prepanng a 0 1 N solution of HCI or for 
preparing solutions of H SO^ HNO 3 and 
so forth 

If you are preparing the dilute HCI to be 
standardized and adjusted to exactly 1 N 
or 0 I N shghtly more concentrated HCI 
should be used to ensure that the dilution 
will not be weaker than the desired normal 
ity For this purpose add 90 or 1000 ml 
of water to 10 ml of concentrated HCI for 
1 N or 0 1 N respectively or use 2 or 3 per 
cent more than the amount calculated from 
the actual analysis of the concentrated 
HCI 

Staudardiiation of hydrochloric and 
sohilioti Proceed as m the standardization 
of sodium hydroxide but m place of the 
standard acid use exactly 10 ml of the ap- 
proximate HCI solution just prepared and

culating results of a titration is the same 
as for making a dilution from stock solu 
tion the volume of one solution tunes its 
normahty is equal to the volume of the 
other solution times its normahty or 
ViN, = V N. 

Thus for the first titraUon m which the 
normahty of the sodium hydroxide was un 
knovvTi and it was found for example that 
It required 9 6 ml to Utrafe 10 ml of the 
standard acid

Oxidation Reduction Titrations 

Oxidation reduction titrations are also 
sometimes used in clinical chemistry Here 
an added indicator is sometimes needed but 
sometimes the color change of one of the 
compounds serves to show the endpoint lodo- 
metnc titrations are of this class These 
are not used commonly in any of our pro- 
cedures but may be used, for example, in 
the standardization of phenol for phospha 
tase determinations The titration of the 
dissohed oxalate precipitate ivith per 
manganate m the determmation of calcium 
is a redox titration the permanganate oxi 
dizing the oxalate the color of perman 
ganate itself shoivs when an excess has 
been added 


Precipitation Titrations 

A precipitation titration Is used in the dc> 
termination of chloride with either silver nJ 
tratc or mercuric nitrate In these a color 
indicator is used that will show when an 
excess of the titrant has been added 


CiiELOMCTRic Titrations 

The chelomctno titration, depending on 
the formation of an un ionized compound is 
utilized in the determination of caiciutn or 
magnesiam by tucstion mfh a solution of 
ethylene dini tnlotetraacctate (eth) lenediam 
ine tctraacetic acid EDTA) A number of 
different color indicators have been proposed 
for these titrations 

Gasomelric ^felho<ls 

If the substance vhosc concentration we 
wish to know is a gas or can be made to 
react to produce a gas we can determine 
that substance by measuring the \oIumc 
of the gas In a calibrated apparatus at 
known temperature and pressure or more 
accurately by measuring with a manometer 
the pressure that the gas exerts when 
brought to a definite \olume at a known 
temperature These methods arc used par- 
ticularly for the determination of the total 
carbon dioxide content of serum or the 


oxygen content and capacity of blood How- 
ever. they may also be used for potassium, 
glucose, lipids, urea, and many other com 
pounds, for most of these, other methods 
arc more suitable

Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods

gasometric measurement in clinical chem 
Istr> are those devised b) Van Sljke and his 
colleagues (Peters and Van Slyke 1932) The 
Yolumetnc form in ivhich the \olumc of gas 
IS measured is sho^^7l in Fig 8 12 and the 
manometric form in ivhich the pressure 
is measured is shown in Fig 8-13 There 
arc aiallable a number of modifications of 
both The apparatus may be shaken bj 
hand or by motor In one recent model a 
magnetic stirring bar has been enclosed 
Yvithin the gas evolution chamber The 
volumetric apparatus may have a small 
trap at the Attorn to catch any alt that 
may leak in through the rubber tubing or 
at Its connection to the glass apparatus 
The manometric apparatus may be all in 
one piece or it may have ground glass 
Joints which make it easier to clean or 
to replace a broken portion they also in 
crease problems of leakage There are also 
at least two microgasometers on the mar 
ket made by Micro Melnc Instruments Co 
and by Scientific Industncs Inc The latter 
can be had in a combination with a micro- 
buret 

One hazard which should be kept in 
mind in using any of these instruments 
is the poisonous nature of mercury espe 
dally the vapor and droplets from finely 
divided mercury when it gets ground under 
foot Spillage should be kept to a minimum 
by careful technique and any that Is spilled 
should be cleaned up There arc a couple 
of commercial mercury collectors on the 
market However the simplest and most 
efTective is a vacuum cleaner which can 
be assembled easily from a filter flask a 
medicine dropper and some rubber tub- 
ing (Fig 8-14) This attached to a vacuum 
pump or aspirator will pick up droplets 


of mercury or will suck up the puddle 
made by wiping together spilled mercury 
With a towel Remember also that mercury 
will amalgamate with copper silver and 
gold so keep jewelry especially nngs out 
of the way 

Another apparatus for analysis of small 
samples of blood for carbon dioxide oxy 
gen or carbon monoxide does not use 
mercury This is the Scholander Houghton 
apparatus (1943) It is not difficult to use 
and a few hours will suffice to learn how The 
determinabon of carbon dioxide is rather 
tricky but the apparatus is well adapted 
to oxygen determination 


CoJortmetnc Methods 

Colorimetry is the most used of the tech 
mques of quantitative analysis in clinical 
chemistry Its value lies m its simplicity 
and sensitmly two essential attributes for 
most cLnlcal chemical determinations II a 
material can be converted into a colored 
dcnvativc one can estimate the amount oI 
the material by estimating the amount of 
color 

■\ isual Colorimetry One of the simplest 
forms of colorimetry is dilution colorimetry 
Here a sfandard colored soFutlon is prcparca 
corresponding to a concentration less than 
that of any sample to be analyzed Tl e un 
known is treated to produce color and its 
solution is diluted until it appears v Istially to 
have the same intensity as the standard 
From the amount of dilution required ti e 
concentration in the original can be cal 
culatcd This method is sometimes used in 
the bedside determination of hemoclobin

nique is the r elative inscns»tivitv of the e\e. 
so that precise measurements of concentra’ 
tlon cannot be made By using a Sasual 
colorimeter" instead of looking at o tubes 
of colored solution, an increase of precision 
can be attained TWs instrument places the 
appearance of the wo solutions side by 
side in the same field Such an instrument 
Is shown in Fig 8-15 The plungers are 
fixed, the cups movable The depth of solu 
tlon between tlie plunger and the bottom 
of llie cup IS \aried until the t«o fields 
match Then, assuming that the depth of 
solut ion is inversely proportional to the con 
c cntraiidn oT colored material and knowin g 
the concentration in the standard, one can 
calculate the concentration of the un- 
known 



where C, and C, arc concentrations of un 
known and standard respectncly and R, 
and R, the readings (depth in miUime 
ters) To calculate the concentration of 
the constituent under investigation that 
was present m the blood or unne sample 
rather than in the final solution, this cqua 
tlon can be expanded 



where 

Wg is the weight of the material in the 
Aolume of standard solution taken, 

Vj and V, are the final volumes of un 
known and standard solutions respectivelj 
Vf IS the volume to which the calculation 
is being made (usually 100 ml or 1 liter 
for blood or the 24 hour volume for urme) 
V, is the volume of unknowTi solution 
taken for color development 

D is any dilution made m the sample be 
fore the volume Vt is taken for analysis 
C, is now the amount of unknown m 
the volume Vj 

The visual colorimeter requires that a 
standard be prepared each time an un 
known Is run (not entirelj a disadvantage) 
It has the advantage over a photoelectric 
Instrument that it is not dependent on 
electne power and would still be useful in 
case of a disaster For this reason one 
should be familiar with its use 

Photoelectric Colorimetry Certain advan

There are two ways of expressing the 
unount of light coming through the colored 
solution One is as trausHiissiori this is the 
fraction of the light striking the colored 


solution that comes through the solution 
(T = I/I„) This fraction Is usually mul 
tiplicd by 100 to give the per cent transmis 
Sion (^T) The second method of expres 
Sion is as absorbance the amount of light 
nof passing through the colored solution 
It IS however a logarithmic value (A = 
log 1/T = -log T =: 2 - log ^■oT) It is the 
same as optical density a commonly used 
but less suitable term Obviously the darker 
a solution the less its per cent transmission 
and the greater its absorbance or optical 
density Different brands of instruments 
vary in the scales they use The Leitz for 
example uses ‘T? T the Coleman and

In these calculations, remember, we have 
used colorimeter readings ^vhich are In 
absorbance urats or some function thereof 
(10 X A, 100 X A, or 500 x A) If the read 
mgs are m T or 9c T, they must first be 
comerted to A (or one of its functions) 
before calculation can be made (unless a 
slide rule is used) 

These calculations ha\e all been based on 
the assumption that a straight hne rela 
ti onship exists between concentration and 
c oTonmeter reading It is an important ^art 
<jf standardizing any determination to 
establish the absorbanceconcentrauon 
cur\e usmg various amounts of the stand 
ard and actually plotting the cune If a 
straight line results the calculauons just 
described may be made If the relationship 
between concentration and absorbance is 
not a straight line the graph must be used 
to comert readings to concentration, or con 
centration \alues corresponding to \anous 
readmgs may be taken from the graph and 
arranged m a table 

With the graphic (or tabular) method 
colorimeter readmgs m terras of T (or *<-T) 
may be used In plotting the results a 
straight line iviU be expected only if ab- 
sorbance \8 concentration is plotted on 
rectilinear paper or if transmission vs con 
centration is put on semilogarithnuc paper 
with the colorimeter readings on the log 
arithmic scale 

In this discussion we have used R, and 
R, to represent the amount of color de 
veloped by the compound being analy'zed 
Actually in most determinations some of 
the fin^ color that is measured results from 
the reagents or from constituents of the 
sample other than the compound bemg 
determined For this reason we ser up 
blanks usually consisting of the reagents 
but substituting water for the sample, a 
“reagent blank Sometimes a second blank 
is necessary to compensate for color present 
in the sample a “sample blank." “serum 
blank,” or “urine blank " The reagent blank 
would be subtracted from both standard 
^ and unknown before calculation the 
sample blank would also be subtracted from 
S the unknown 

" There are two v\ays the blank can be 
' subtracted from the total leadmg first, 
the colonmeter can be set to zero absorb 
ance vath distilled water (or some other 
reference solution or air), lioth blank and 
standard or unknown read and the blank 
subtracted from the other readings This 
can be done only if readings are in ab- 
sorbance or some funcuon of it If read 
mgs are made m 9flT, they must be con- 


verted to absorbance before the subtraction 
can be made Second, the subtraction can 
be made on the colonmeter by settmg to 
zero absorbance usmg the blank solution 
Sometimes one procedure Is easier, some 
times the other If the same analysis is 
bemg made on a considerable number of 
samples it is easier to set the instrument 
with the blank and let the instrument do 
the subtracUng If only one or two samples 
are being run on several different determi 
nations it might be easier to leave the 
colonmeter at the same distilled water 
zero setting Also if the blank color is not 
stable, the instrument should not be set 
at zero with it The zero setting should be 
made with a stable reference so that it can 
be rechecked 

How often should the zero absorbance 
(loo's T) setting (and also the zero 9s T 
setting on a few instruments, such as the 
Spectromc 20) be checked? As often as 
necessary Start olf by checking frequently . 
if no change is found, check less often 
With some of the less stable instruments it 
may be necessary to check and readjust 
after almost every readmg others may re 
mam steady for hours 

Cuvet Selection Cuvet’ is just a fancy 
word ior the test tube or other container in 
which the colored solution is placed in the 
colonmeter Obviously, if we want to know 
the absorbance of the colored solution any 
thing else we put m the light path, includ 
ing the cuvet and any dirt, scratches, or 
flaws that may be on it, must be the same 
for each solution The best way to keep 
dirt (including fingcrpnnts) constant is to 
avoid It The cuvet should be wiped off 
routinely and checked for cleanlines s each 
tune it is placed in the insfiument 
Scratches are of no concern if they remain 
the same as when the tube is first used 
Appearance of additional scratches will 
affect the calibration Flaws and vanation s 
in the thickness and " optical prfippitif?r~nf 
t hg glass at vanous pomts on the cuve t 
mean lhat any one tube will not reaef the 
same in all positions Therefore, the tube 
should be in the same position each time it 
is used This is conventionally attained by 
always havung the brand mark on the cuvet 
turned toward (or away from) the operator 
This should not be a sensitive spot (slight 
change in position or rotauon of the tube 
should not affect the reading) Actually it 
is not necessary to have more than one 
cuvet Usually, however, it is more conven 
lent to have a senes of matched tubes 
available 

Matched cuvets can be purchased for tlie

Operating Instructions for Colorimeters 
I tsual 

Bauscii and Lomu Place empty cups 
In correct position on colorimeter (they 
should be numbered the same as the colonm 
eter and as left or right) Raise the racks 
until the plunger touches the inside bottom 
of the cup The scales should read zero if 
not adjust the scales to zero or correct each 
subsequent reading for the variation 

Place the same colored solution in both 
cups rinsing cups and plungers if neces 
sary fill the cups about half full Set the 
cups at 20 0 mm See that there are no 
bubbles under the plungers 

Set the instrument in front of a good 
light source Look through the e>epiece 
Adjust the mirror (preferably using the 
milk glass reflector) and the position of 
the colorimeter itself so that the two hahes 
of the field look the same (adjust the focus 
of the eyepiece if necessary) Now check 
lor proper adjustment by running one cup 
up or down and coming back to visual 
match The reading should of course be 
20 again If not readjust the instrument 

The Instrument is now ready for use 
Do not disturb the position of the colorim 
cter mirror or light until readings have 
been completed Place the unknown solu 
tion in the left cup and set it at 20 0 Place 
the standard In the nght cup and read 
When fimshed nnse cups and plungers

In using the colorimeter be sure that 
there is enough solution in the cup so that 
the plunger Is immersed when Caking read 
ings Also be careful that there is not so 
much solution that it overflows when the 
cup IS run up Some reagents are extremely 
corrosive to glass or metal Wash off any 
spills immedlatel) Be careful not to get 
solutions on the metal collar around the 
plunger or on the metal shield of the cups 
This may ruin the determination and dam 
age the instrument

of the prehmnary steps of the analysis can 
be (or CYen should be) omitted Thus, in 
some methods for the determination of 
glucose tungstic acid is added to blood to 
remo\e the proteins HoweYCr, with a pure 
aqueous glucose solution contammg no 
protein no precipitate nould form and the 
tungstic acid would remain and would 
interfere m the reaction Sometimes some 
constituent of the sample other than the 
compound bemg determined will affect the 
result Thus serum protems will affect the 
readmg obtamed with faromsulfalem there 
fore the standard should also contam 
serum In this example it is easy to get 
serum free of the constituent being sought 
In some cases the constituent is present 
normally and serum cannot be added with 
out affectmg the amount of the compound 
present Therefore to get the effect of 
serum it is necessary to mal^e the determm 
ation on a serum low in content of the 
compound being determined and on a 
second sample of the same serum containing 
a knoYvn additional amount of the compound 
and to consider the difference in readings as 
the result of the added amount of standard 
Fortunately this is infrequent and pure 
solutions usually suffice for accurate stand 
ardization 

Sometimes it is difficult or impossible to 
obtam in pure form the material bemg de- 
termmed There are two ways m which this 
problem is handled In the enzyme determi 
nations e g amylase phosphatase and 
transaminase instead of determining the 
amount of these compounds we determine 
the amount of some material that is us ed 
up or formed m the reaction th at_lhe 
e nzym e ^t alyzes under certain we lljefined_ 
c ondi tions Thus we may measure amylase 
activity by determining the amount of mal 
lose formed or of starch used up or measure 
phosphatase by the amount of phenol or 
phosphate spbt off a substrate 

In some instances when it is difficult to 
obtain a pure standard as m the case of 
hemoglobm or bilirubin a different ap- 
proach 15 used For hemoglobm we may 
analyze a blood sample by a different 
method for example by detejmuung its 
iron content or oxygen capacity and by 
calculating from this and from the knmvn 
iron content or oxygen capacity of hemo- 
globm the hemoglobm content of the blood 
sample We can now use this blood to 
standardize the hemoglobin method Such 
analyzed hemoglobm solutions are now 
available commeraally for laboratones that 


do not have the time or facihties to do the 
standardization themselves 

Another approach is to use a substitute or 
artificial standard Here a colored solution 
IS prepared and its absorbance is compared 
with that of a carefully sometimes tedi 
ously. prepared pure standard Thereafter 
the artificial standard may be used in place 
of the natural one This procedure has 
certam limitations The method used in the 
routine determmation must be one that is 
reproducible, always giving the same color 
intensity for the same amount of material 
It could not, for example be used for the 
determmation of cholesterol or glucose, 
for these do not always give the same ab- 
sorbance for the same concentration The 
determmation of hemoglobm by the alkah 
hematm method meets these requirements 
Gibson and Hamson ( J945) have descnbed 
a solution of morgamc salts that is suitable 
as an artificial standard for hemoglobm It 
may be prepared m the laboratory or pur 
chased {from W H Curtm & Co, P O 
Box 118 Houston Texas) m sealed tubes 
for use in the coloruneter For the stand 
ardization of bilirubin Moreland O'Donnell 
and Cast (1950) proposed using the color 
developed m the determination of sulfamla 
raide They carefully punfied several 
samples of bihrubm and determined the 
bilmibin equivalent of the sulfatulamide 
reaction 

Another problem arises in the use of 
these aruficial standards the question of 
their applicability to mstrumenis other than 
the one on which they were calibrated 
Different kinds of photoelectric colonmeters 
differ in spectral quality of the Lght source 
and in the band width of the light passed 
by the filter or grating If the wave length 
absoibance curve for the artificial standard 
IS the same as that of the color from the 
determmation then the standard should 
be usable on vanous mstruments This is 
true of the artificial alkah hematin stand 
ard and of the use of the sulfanilamide and 
bilirubm reactions It is not true of the use 
of a copper sulfate solution as a standard 
for the thymol turbidity determmauon as 
proposed by Ducci (1947) for the Evelyn 
photoelectric colorimeter The copper sul 
fate solution and the turbid solutions have 
quite different wave length-absorbance 
curves Therefore the turbidity equivalence 
of the copper sulfate will be different in 
different mstruments or at different wave 
lengths 

How often should standards be run in

colonmetnc determinations? As for the 
question on checking the zero setting of the 
colorimeter the answer is as often as 
necessary Some reactions are highly repro 
ducifale being relatuely insensitive to slight 
differences in temperature light intensity 
time of heating or other technical vatia 
tlons and relatively unaffected by the age 
of reagents or the slight differences in 
different batches of reagents If the instru 
merit used is hkewise stable standardiza 
tion need be done only occasionally On the 
other hand some reactions are sensitive to 
these conditions and a standard must be 
run with each batch of unknmvns Other 
reactions must be standardized each time 
a new batch of reagents is made or at 
intervals as a reagent ages The frequency 
of standardization then will \ar> with de 
terminations and judgment and expen 
ence are necessary for the efficient use of 
standards 

Technicians who do not have the time or 
facilities to prepare their own standards 
can purchase them from any reliable 
chemical supply dealer The techmcian 
must houevei be acquainted with the 
properties of these standards some sup 
pliers are oteioptimistic about their stability 
or remiss m cautioning against detenora 
tion Also many different versions of stand 
aids exist for different methods of de 
termining the same compound Not all are 
Interchangeable For example cholesterol 
standard may be made up in chloroform or 
in acetic acid The techmcian must be 
aware of what she needs m a standard and 
must specify carefully to be sure the sup 
phers wall understand 

This brmgs us to another type of prepara 
tion which has become available in the 
last few years This is the control seriim 
which is now available from several sources 
notably the Clinical Chemistry Control 
Serum and Abnormal Clinical Chemistry 
Control Serum of Hyland Laboratories This 
is human serum that has been freeze dried 
and carefully analyzed Each vial is ac 
compamed by an analysis of that particular 
lot These preparations should not however 
be used for standards This would double 
the uncertainty of the results h> adding the 
possible vanations of the manufacturers 
analysts to those of the technician These 
preparations are valuable because they 
enable the technician to see whether she is 
getting correct results If one does not agree 
with the furnished value a careful search 
should be made for a possible source of 
error A less expensive way of providing 


daily evidence of control is to prepare ones 
own pool of serum freeze it in individual 
tubes and use one tube each day to check 
the reproducibility of results 

Standardization should be extended to 
cover as much as possible of the range of 
concentrations one expects to encounter 
Sometimes the upper limit of a determma 
tion is set by the reagents thus in some 
methods for blood sugar there is sufficient 
copper present for only about 400 mg per 
cent glucose When concentrations above 
this are met a smaller sample must be 
used At other times the upper limit is de 
termined by the optical density of the 
colored solution There are two ways beside 
dilution in which this may be decreased 
Remember that optical density is not an 
inherent property of a solution but rather 
is a property of a certain solution m a 
particular cuvet at a specified wave length 
By using a smaller cuvet the optical density 
will be less therefore if the standardiza 
uon is done in two sizes of cuvets a wider 
range can be covered with no change an 
procedure Also by reading at two wave 
lengths the range can be increased For 
example in the determination of blood 
sugar the blue solution is usually read with 
blue light By shifting to red the optical 
density is greatly increased and low blood 
sugar concentrations can be read more 
accurately Standards and blanks must of 
course be read at the same wave length as 
the unknowns 

riuonmetnc Methods 

Fluorescence is the property of a com 
pound of emitting light of a longer wave 
length than the light illuminating it Some 
compounds fluoresce in visible light many 
others require ultraviolet activation (or 
even x irradiation) Several compounds of 
importance in clinical chemistry fluoresce 
e g quinine quimdine porphyrins epi 
nephnne and norepinephrine thiamine 
and nboflavin Fluorimetnc measurements 
differ from colorimetric measurements in 
that the photocell is placed at the side of 
the cuvet reacting to light that comes out 
at right angles to the illuminating beam 
Means must be provided for regulating the 
wave length of both the incident and the 
fluorescent light This may be done with 
either filters or prisms The pnmary filter 
or monochromator setting should be chosen 
to give maximum fluorescence the second

produced when an element is excited by 
the heat of a flame It is based on the flame 
tests used in general chemistry that show 
that sodium produces a yellow flame potas 
Slum a violet flame and lithium strontium 
and calcium a ted flame If we provide a 
reproducible means of getting the sample 
into the flame and of measuring the m 
tensity of the hght produced we will have 
a flame photometer Like absorption pho- 
tometers flame photometers may be single 
or double photocell the wave length of the 
hght ma> be selected by colored glass or 
inteiferencc filters or by pnsms The flame 
photometer may be a 8eIf<ontained in 
strumcni or it may be an attachment put 
on a spectrophotometer The sample diluted 
serum or unne or tissue extract is earned 
into the flame as a vapor or spray The 
solution may be fed through an atomiier 
and earned in the air supply to the burner 
or it may be atomized by a straight tube 
directly into the flame The flame may be 
city gas hydrogen or acetylene burning 
in air or oxygen If the light from the ele- 
ment being determined (usually sodium or 
potassium sometimes calcium) is meas 
ured directly in a single photocell instru 
ment the rate of atomization and the gas 
and air pressures must be held very close 
since variation in these would cause vana 
tions In the readings The double photocell 
Instrument is used with the internal stand 
ard method A carefully measured amount 
of another element usually lithium is 
added to the diluted sample and the 
amount of light produced by it and by the 
element being determined are both meas 
ured The relative intensities arc used to 
calculate the concentration of the unknown 
This technique requires less precise rcgula 
tion of atomization and of flame and leads 
to increased stability 
Sodium and potassium levels are readlU 
determined by flame photometry Good 
technique is essential to get correct results 
care in making dilutions and care to avoid 


contamination from the water used for 
dilution and from the glassware Much dis 
tilled water is not sufficiently pure It can 
be purified easily by running through a 
monobed deiomzer such as the Barnstcad 
Bantam demlnerahzer Water with a con 
ductility less than that of 0 3 parts per 
million of sodium chlondc is satisfactory 
and not difficult to attain Glassware must 
be washed carefully and rinsed thoroughly 
with good distilled water Both the sample 
and the hthium solution must be measured 
carefully 

Calcium can be estimated at the concen 
tration that exists in serum with the hot 
flame instrument But even here we are 
working at the limit of sensitivity and sta 
btlity It is essential to work carefully and 
to go back and forth from standard to un 
known several times in order to obtain a 
reliable reading It is largely a matter of 
personal preference whether the flame or 
chemical method should be used for cal 
cium 

As wub colorimeters some flame pho- 
tometers are read directly from the current 
generated by the photocells Others use an 
amphficr circuit to increase sensitivity The 
latter type usually is satisfactory when 
working properly but as with any elec 
ironic equipment it may cause trouble 
The simpler instruments are generally more 
reliable 

Chromntof;rttl>hic Methods 

Chromatography is a very useful rela 
uvely simple technique for separating sub 
stances that cannot be separated easily by 
other means The name derives from the 
fact that it was first used by the Russian 
botanist Tswett for the separation of col 
ored compounds from plant leaves Most 
of the applications of the process involve 
colorless compounds and various methods 
of detecting them are used 

The procedure Is based on the relative 
degree of adsorption of the dissolved com 
pounds being separated on a solid material 
over which the solution flows slowly It 
also depends on the relative solubility of 
the compounds being separated in two 
liquid phases Of these two liquid phases 
one Is fixed and the other moving one may 
be water adsorbed on the supporting solid 
(eg paper contains about 15 per cent 
water) and the other is the solvent moving 
across the solid Owing to these differences 
in adsorption or solubility some of the com 
pounds move more rapidly than others 



Clinical CiiENns7x\

This may be taken advantage of in two 
ways the compounds may be found at dif 
ferent places on the adsorbent or they may 
appear at different times m the stream 
emerging from the adsorbent Sometimes 
the various compounds may all be adsorbed 
together at first and then be moied differ 
entially across the adsorbent by a second 
eluting solvent Or rather than for sepa 
rating several compounds chromatography 
may be used simply to purify a single sub 
stance by using an adsorbent that ivill stop 
the substance and let some or all of the 
impurities pass on The desired compound 
is then removed by a solvent that will 
specifically dissolve it without taking an> 
of the adsorbed impurities 

This general procedure may be applied 
m several different wa^s The adsorbent 
may be a granular or powdered sohd placed 
in a vertical column and the solution of 
the compounds to be separated may be 
allowed to dry This end of the stnp is then 
compounds to be separated hav e appre 
ciable vapor pressures at temperatures that 
can be used a small sample of the solution 
to be resolved can be applied to one end 
of a column of adsorbent From this end 
then a stream of gas maj be passed 
through to move the compounds being 
separated This is called gas chroma 
tography 

The most commonly used technique is 
paper chromatography In which a drop of 
the solution being analyzed is placed near 
one end of a strip of hlter paper and 
allowed to dry This end of the stnp is then 
dipped into a solvent without allowing the 
applied spot to dip into the liquid The 
solvent moves along the strip by capillary 
attraction either with or against gravity 
After a suitable time the strip fs removed 
dned and examined If the compounds are 
colored no further treatment may be ncces 
sary or the compounds may be visible 
under ultraviolet light Usually however 
the paper Ins to be sprayed with a reigcnt 
vvhicli will react with the compounds to 
develop a color To improve the separations 
tvv o*dlmenslonal paper chromatography 
ma> be used The solution is spotted near 
the comer of a sheet of filter paper and 
one edge is immersed in a solvent After 
a time the sheet Is removed dned and 
then turned 90'’ and the edge along which 
the fust movement occurred is Immersed 
in a second solvent which now spreads the 
compounds across the paper separating 
mixtures that moved together in the first 
solvent 


Since under the same conditions a given 
compound always moves at the same rate 
with respect to the solvent front v\c can 
characterize compounds b) their Rf or the 
distance the> have moved divided bj the 
distance the solvent has moved Sometimes 
the Rf is so small that w e allow the solv ent 
to move off the far edge of the paper In 
this case we can add a known compound 
for reference and express the movement 
of our compound in relation to this refer 
ence compound Thus could be the 
distance moved by some sugar divided by 
the distance that glucose has mov ed 
Amino acids from a protein hydrolysate 
are usually separited by two-dimensional 
papergramy in this case i map can be 
prepared using known amino acids in the 
same solvent system and noting their final 
positions Comparison of the unknown with 
the map will show which amino acids it 
contams 

Paper chromatography is useful in dim 
cal chemistry for separating porphyrins 
for the identification of sugars in unne

A wide vanety of equipment is available 
for chromatography Some separations can 
be made on paper strips suspended in a 
test tube or mixing cylinder Paper sheets 
can be handled in a beaker battery jar or 
cyhndncal glass jar Elaborate cabinets

Chromatobox prondes a convenient inex 
pensive means of doing one dimensional 
paper chromatography in a smaU space 
By Tolling the paper strip inside a Teflon 
band a 19 inch strip can be accommodated 
in a box 3 inches square and 2 inches high 
(Fig &-18) The band has a surface pat 
tern of raised points to minimize contact 
with the paper and to prevent distortion 
of the chromatographic pattern The box 
has a small compartment for the 10 to IS 
ml of solient required and a larger one 
for the rolled paper (Chromatobox is a 
trade name Research Specialties Co is the 
sole U S distributor for the Item which is

Electrolfhorettc Methods 
Electrophoresis is the movement of 
charged particles m an electric field It 
has been applied to the movement of cells 
in suspension and of colloidal particles It 
IS useful in clinical chemistry for the 
identification of proteins The rate of move 
ment depends not only on the intensity 
of the electric field but also on the size 
shape and electric charge of the colloidal 
particle or molecule Therefore different 
proteins move at different rates These rates 
vary with pH and the variation is not the 
same for all proteins Therefore in making 
identification it may be helpful to perform 
electrophoresis at more than one pH 

Free and zone electrophoresis differ from 
each other m that in the former a solution 
of the charged particles is placed direcily 
m the electnc field and analyzed In tbe 
latter the solution being analyzed is “sup 
ported on filter paper a layer of starch 
granules an agar gel or some other sohd 
or semisolid medium This latter technique 
is simpler m decreasing the interference 
from diffusion and in providing stability 
to the separated fractions since they are in 
a solid medium rather than a liquid As 
with chromatography the greatest use of 
electrophoresis is made with filter paper 
as the supportmg medium The usual pro- 


cedure is to dampen a stnp of paper with 
buffer solution place a small sample of 
the solution to be analyzed near the middle 
of the stnp and dip the ends of the strip 
m buffer solution into which electrodes are 
placed After several hours the strip is 
removed dned stained if necessary and 
examined If the matenals being separated 
are colored as with hemoglobin staining 
may be unnecessary The technique may 
be made quantitative by measunng tbe 
intensity of the color of the several frac 
tions This may be done by cuttmg out 
each spot elutmg the color into solution 
and measunng its intensity m a photo- 
electric colonmeter or by passing the in 
tact stnp through a densitometer (i e be 
tween a light and a photoelectnc cell) and 
observing the relative mtensities This proc 
ess may be done automatically with a 
densitometer that draws a curve showing 
relative intensiues along the stnp and also 
integrates the curve to give a quantitative 
measure of each component 

Potenliomelnc Methods 

Differences in concentration of Ions pro- 
duces an electneal potential which may 
be measured vvith suitable electrodes and 
measunng equipment In clinical chem 
mry methods based on this pnnciple have 
been described for determining hydrogen 
and chlonde ions 

For determining hydrogen ion concen 
tration or pH, a glass electrode is used 
which consists of a mercury acid or a 
silver silver chloride system behind a thin 
glass membrane A. calomel half-cell com 
pletes the cell A vacuum tube i>otentiome 
ter IS used to measure the potential The 
glass electrode is fragile and must be 
handled carefully It is also affected by 
drying and should be kept wet or soaked 
for several hours before bemg used Tern 
perature affects the potential and must be 
considered Most commercial pH meters 
have temperature compensation circuits 
Many types of both potentiometers and 
electrodes are available The meter may 
be large or small portable or fixed more 
or less sensitive battery-operated or line 
operated and more or less expensive 

A pH meter is actually used only to 
compare the pH of two different solutions 
smee It must be standardized with a solu 
Uon of known pH before it can be used 
the determinations are therefore no better 
than the accuracy of the standardizing buf 
fer solution As with a colorimeter this

initial setting must be checked frequently 
enough to avoid error from drift 

Electrodes may be chosen for many ap 
pbcations For measurements within the 
case of the instrument shielded leads are 
not needed For outside use longer shielded 
leads may be useful this type is adapted 
to titration or to intragastric measurements 
Special electrodes for small volume and for 
anaerobic specimens are available There 
are also electrodes designed for immersion 
In a constant temperature batli For de 
termination of blood pH it imght be well 
to caution that mineral oil on the glass 
electrode may gne an erroneously high 
reading 

Potentiometnc methods have also been 
used for other ions A utration method for 
serum and urine chloride adaptable to 
microsamples has been described Mcr 
cury and silver electrodes ate used Silver 
nitrate is added from a buret until the 
potentiometer response indicates that all 
the chloride ions have reacted 

CARBOHTOIIATES 

Carbohydrates are organic compounds 
containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen 
Some of their denvatives may also contain 
nitrogen though this Is unusual The car 
bohydrates include the sugars and com 
pounds that yield sugars on hydrolysis 
The sugars may be monosaccharides 
which are simple single sugar molecules 
or disacchandes which are composed of 
two monosaccharides joined through an 
oxygen by elimination of a molecule of 
water The polysaccharides contain many 
molecules of monosaccharides joined to- 
gether and have lost the charactensucs of 
sugars C hemically the mono saccharides 
gre polyhydroxy aidenvdes'oF'ketones and" 
Me theretore easily 'oxidized whiclT is to 
say they are reducing compounds If the 


two sugare of a disacchande are joined 
through the active aldehyde or ketone 
groups the disacchande will not be a re 
ducing sugar if the aldehyde or ketone of 
one monosacchande is jomed to a hydroxyl 
group of the other there will still be one 
free aldeh>de or ketone group and the di 
saccharide will be a reducing sugar although 
not so active as the monosaccharides The 
polysaccharides consist of long chains of 
monosaccharides joined through the aide 
hyde or ketone of one'to a hydroxyl of the 
next They therefore hav e one active group 
on the end but m such a large molecule 
this is insufficient to make it a reducing 
compound A monosacchande may hav e 
as few as two or as many as seven carbons 
m us chain These are designated from the 
chain length as dioses trioses tetroses 
pentoses hexoses and heptoses The nature 
of the active group may be shown by desig 
naung them as ketoses and aldoses Actu 
ally the monosacchandes exist mostly in a 
nng form with an oxygen bridge between 
the first and fifth carbon atoms as shown 
in Fig 8-19 rather than as the free aide 
hydes In this form the h>droxyl group on 
the first carbon can be either on the same 
side as or on the opposite side from the 
hydroxyl on the second carbon these two 
forms are called n and They are mter 
convertible in solution and whichever we 
Stan with the same eqmhbnum mixture 
results 

The stabihty of different types of carbo 
hydrates with various reagents differs con 
siderably The di and polysaccharides are 
all split by acid mto monosaccharides 
which are stable The nonreducing carbo 
hydrates (the polysaccharides and sucrose) 
are stable in alkaline solution while the 
reducing sugars break down There are a 
number of chemical reactions that are used 
as qualitative and quantitative tests for 
carbohydrates

The reducing power of sugars is the 
basis of tests that use (a) c opper or iron 
reagents such as Benedict s test and Clirn 
tpst and the quantitative determination by 
ui® ^Ejqlin Wu^ Benedict Nelson Somogyi 
and the femejanide methods, or (b) picnc_ 
ot d mitrosalKwhc acid. In the copper tests 
the sugar reacts m alkaline solution being 
oxadized by the cupnc ion which is sunul 
taneously reduced to cuprous and preapi 
tates as the red cuprous oxide The forma 
tion of cuprous oxide is the basis of 
Benedicts qualitauve test and Clinitest Im 
the quanutati\e determmauons the cuprous! 
oxide IS allowed to react with a phospho- \ 
jnolyb dic or arsenomoI>bdic acid reducingj 
It to a blue color, which is measured m a 
rnlnnmpty In the deternunatioD by fera 
C 3 anide ’the glucose may be estimated by 
the decrease in the yellow femcya™de color 
<this teacQon is used in the Autoanalyzer 
method) or the ferrocyanide may be al 
lowed to react with ferric ions to produce 
an intense blue color as in the Folin Malm 
ros micromethod Unfortunately this last 
reaction is quite variable and it is difficult 
to obtain reproduable results with it 
r Glucose may be oxidized enzymatically to 
' glucomc acid hydrogen peroxide is formed 
m this reaction and may be induced to oxi 
.dize some colorless material to a colored 
compound This is the basis of the tests 
for glucose with glucose oxidase Quali 
tatively this is us^ in Tes-Tape and in 
CUmstix Unstix and Combistix It may 
also be used quantitauvely, the Glucostat 
method bemg a commercial form of this 
lest Since the enzyme is specific for 


cose the methods based on it should give 
true blood glucose values However, there 
may be other compounds m the blood or 
unne that wiU also react with hjdrogen 
peroxide and will therefore compete with 
the color producing reaction and cause low 
results. 

The carbohjdrates of interest m chmeal 
chemistry are listed m Table B-3 Xylo* 
ketose is a pentose w^ch a few people ex 
Crete in the unne This trait is familial 
and seems to cause no symptoms It is 
important that this sugar not be confused 
with glucose lest the patient be treated as 
a diabetic Glujrose also known as d^\ , 
trose IS the* common sugar of the body 
and of the blood It is the one usually given 
when intravenous sugar is desired although 
fructose is sometimes administered It may 
occur in the unne when the blood sugar 
is elevated or m a few people even with 
a normal blood sugar Fractose^also knovyn 
as^ leyulose occurs free m honey along 
with glucose It is utilized more readily 
by the diabehc than is glucose It is rarely 
found in the unne Galactose is not nor 
mally encountered free but is of importance 
because of its occurrence in lactose and in 
certain compound lipids found m the ner 
\ous system In infants lacking the enzyme 
phosphogalactotransferase g^actose can 
not ^ utilized it accumulates m the body 
and IS excreted in the unne This condiuon 
of galactosemia may be hannful and nulk 
IS usually eliminated from the infants diet 
Therefore the recognition of galactose is 
fxx^sionally of importance

mon food sugar Since it consists of a 
glucose molecule combined through its 
aldehyde group iMth the ketone group of 
a fructose molecule it is not a reducing 
sugar It IS easily h^droli^ed into glucose 
and fructose by the enzyme sucrase or 
imcrtase or by acid It is not formed in 
the animal body Maltose is important 
chiefly because it is a breakdownn product 
of the digestion of starch The enzjme 
amylase splits starch down through dex 
tnn to the disacchande stage Maltose 
remains if no maltase is present to split 
it to glucose Hjdroljsls of starch by acid 
of course proceeds to glucose In the sac 
charogemc methods for determining amy 
lase m serum or other fluids it is maltose 
that IS actually determmed Lactose is the 
sugar of milk and is therefore a normal 
food of infants only rarely is it not properly 
metabolized It sometimes appears in the 
unne during late pregnancy or lactation 
and should not be mistaken for glucose 

Starch is a polysaccharide of glucose 
Actually starch is a mixture of two types 
of glucose polymers amylose and amy 
lopectin Amylose is a linear or non 
branched 1 4 polymer in which the aide 
hyde group of one glucose Is combined to 
tbe hydroxyl group on the fourth carbon 
of the next glucose. Amylopectin contains 
1 6 branches ofl the main cham with a 
second glucose combining through its aide 
hyde group to the hydroxyl on the sixth 
carbon of one of tbe glucose units m the 
chain Starch is used in the laboratory as 
an indicator for iodine wth which it forms 
a dark blue compound and as a substrate 
for amylase in the determination of this 
enzyme 

Glycogen is the polymeric storage form 
of glucose in the animal body It is 
branched like amylopectin but gites a red 
color with iodine Inuhn is a polymer 
of fructose found in ceitain plants It is 
sometimes used in the laboratory in the 
measurement of kidney function Dextran 
is a 1 6 polymer of glucose that is formed 
by certain microorganisms It is water solu 
ble and not metabolized in the ammal body 
It IS sometimes used as a blood substitute 
or plasma extender since u is a large 
enough molecule to be only slowly lost 
from the blood Cellulose is a structural 
material of plants it is a I 4 polymer of 
^ glucose It IS not hydrolyzed by enzymes 
of the human body It is used m the labora 
tory chiefly in the form of filter paper and 
cotton 

There are several other carbohydrates 


417 

that occur in the body but thus far are not 
likely to be encountered m tbe clinical 
laboratory These include glyceraldehyde 
and dihydroxyacetone which occur during 
the breakdown of glucose and nbose and 
deoxymbose ivhich occur in nucleic acids 
Certain carbohydrate den\ atn es also occur 
glucuronic acid in which the aldehyde 
group of glucose has been oxidized to a 
carboxyl group is attached to a number of 
cydic hydroxy compounds before excre 
tion including steroids bilirubin and a 
number of drugs Glucosamine occurs with 
glucuronic acid m heparm and in cartilage 

Qumiltimne Delermtnnlion of Glucose 

The amount of glucose m the blood is 
increased followng a meil The detenmna 
non of glucose on a random sample of 
blood is therefore of little value as a first 
esumate of a person s abihty to metabolize 
glucose The blood should be drawn suffi 
ciently long after the last meal so that 
the food is completely digested and ab 
sorbed and any excess is stored This is 
normally m the morning before breakfast 
and yields a “fasting blood sugar or FBS 
Fasting here means not only no breakfast 
but no cream or sugar m coffee no tea or 
coke no drugs that might aifect the blood 
sugar such as coffee or agarettes and 
no emotional disturbance that might cause 
the liberation of glucose into the blood 
Fasting does not mean no water the patient 
should be permitted water as usual 

Normally there is 70 to 90 mg per cent 
of glucose m the blood an increase abo\e 
this is called hyperglycemia and a decrease 
IS called hijpogUjcemia Actually glycemia 
refers to any sugar in tbe blood with no 
specific reference to glucose The terms 
hyper and hypoglucemia would be better 
the rise following a meal is called ah 
mentarif hyperglucemta The most frequent 
cause of hyperglycemia m a fasting patient 
is diabetes mellitus This consists of a rela 
live deficiency in insulin and may be 
caused by pancreatic insufficiency or by 
adrenal or pituitary hyperfunction HyTer 
glycemia may rarely be due to decreased 
kidney funcuou Hypoglycemia may be due 
to increased pancreatic activity (as in an 
islet cell tumor) to subnormal adrenal 
Ainctran or to decreased reabsorption by 
the kidney tubules (decreased rend 
threshold)

in well stoppered containers filled to ca

The concentrations of the wotkmg 
solutions of Zn and Ba are not so important 
as the requirement that they exactly neu

ml of ZnS04 solution mto a 250 ml flask 
and add approximately 50 ml of HjO and 
4 drops of phenolphthalein mdieator 


Slowly titrate with Ba(OH)<., using con 
tmual agitation (Note too rapid addition 
of the Ba(OH)3 will give a false endpoint ) 
The titration is earned out until 1 drop of 
Ba(OH)>. turns the solution a faint pmk 
The result should be such that 30 ml of 
ZnS04 require 10 ml of Ba(OH)2 i 0 05 
ml If one or the other of the two soluuons 
is too strong add distilled water m ap* 
propnate quantities and repeat the titra 
tion Store the solutions m aspirator or 
siphon bottles the one containing the 
banum hydroxide should carry a soda 
lime tube in the stopper The solutions 
should be tested in advance by preparing a

flfticoie Tolerance Tests 

In patients whose blood sugar is normal 
or only slightly elevated the ability of the 
body to metabolize glucose may be imesti 
gated bv increasing the load on body mcch 


Laboratory Mcthods 

anisms as is done by investigating the 
functional capacity of the liver kidney 
and intestine for example If the blood 
sugar is markedly elevated a glucose tolcr 
ance test is superfluous just as is a urea 
clearance test when the blood urea nitrogen 
IS elevated or a bromsulfalein test when tlie 
the patient has jaundice 

There are several forms of the glucose 
tolerance test in use The simplest and 
easiest and the one that should usually be 
done IS the two-hour postprandial glucose 
determination In this test the patient is 
given a breakfast containing 100 gm of 
carbohydrate and the blood glucose is de 
lemuned two hours later The glucose con 
centration should be below 120 mg per 
cent at two hours 

The commonest procedure for the oral 
glucose tolerance testJs unfortunately to 
draw blood for a fasting sugar and then to 
give the patient SO^or 100 gm of glucose 
or 1 gm per kilogram of ideal bodv weight 
and determine the blood sugar one two 
and three hours afterward sometimes blood 
IS also drawn at one half hour or at four 
five and six hours If this type of test must 
be done Hoffman (1059) suggests that a 
glucose dose of 1 gm per kilogram be used 
for adults and children over 12 years for 
younger children 2 gm per kilogram and 
for infants 3 gm per kilogram Moreover 
blood samples should be taken at 0 60 90 
and 150 minutes The glucose should be 
given with about seven times its weight 
of water (eg for a 70 kg man give 70 
gm of glucose and 490 ml of water) 
since more concentrated solutions must 
dilute themselves by absorbing water into 
the Intestinal tract before the glucose can 
be absorbed into the blood 

The term “tolerance” refers to the ability 
of the body to handle glucose Therefore 
high tolerance is indicated by a small rise 
in blood glucose after its oral administra 
non low tolerance means a high blood 
glucose response In a normal person th e

Firiiire 8-20. Typical oral glucose tolerance 
curves in normal and dialietic subjects, (HotTman, 
VV. S.s The Biochemistry of Clinical Medicine 2nil 
Ed. Chicago, The Year Book Publishers, Inc., 1959 ) 


impressed with the value of glucose toler- 
ance tests for the diagnosis of diabetes in 
hospital practice, In most instances of dia- 
betes. the diagnosis can be made from the 
morning blood glucose value and from the 
association of glycosuria with a typical 
hlstorj' and symptomatology. In the ab- 
sence of glycosuria and fasting hyper- 
glycemia. blood glucose determination and 
urinalysis an hour after a breakfast of 
orange Juice, cereal with sugar, two pieces 
of toast, and a glass of milk will usually 
permit a diagnosis of hyperglycemia and 
glycosuria. However, even this test, which 
has the advantage of simplicity, has the 
same drawback as the more formal glucose 
tolerance test in that it is influenced by pre- 
vious diet, the emotional state, acute ill- 
ness, especially infection or trauma, exer- 
cise. and obesity, The_£lucosj Jolerance test 
Is more Important for riifing out diabetes 
than for ruling it in In other words, a 
normal curve Is more significant than a 
moderately abnormal one. Therefore the 
test has value for insurance purposes, for 
dissipating fear of diabetes in members of 
a family in which there is a diabetic, and 
for determination of the presence of renal 
glycosuria or of an unusual reducing reac- 
tion of a urine specimen.” 

The five- and six-liour glucose tolerance 
tests arc usually requested to aid in the 
diagnosis of hypoglycemia. It would be 
much more to the point to draw a blood 
sample at the time the patient is showing 
the symptoms in order to establish or rule 
out hypoglycemia. The shape of the three- 
hour glucose tolerance curve may then be 
a clue to the type of hypoglycemia. 

Glucose tolerance is impaired by fasting 
or by a low carbohydrate intake. If the 
patient’s carbohydrate intake has been 
poor, a tolerance test may result in a dla- 
liciic curve; the same patient on a good diet 
might show a normal tolerance. If there 
is any doubt that the patient’s carbohydrate 
intake has been adequate, he should be 
placed on a diet containing at least 250 
gm. of carbohydrate per day for three days, 
or his diet may be supplemented with a 
liter of 30 per cent glucose daily for three 
days. 

Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test. 
The oral test depends not only on the ability 
of the body to handle glucose but also on 
the rate of glucose absorption from the 
intestine. ’This latter is affected in some 
diseases, particularly hyper- and hypo- 
thyroidism. To eliminate this effect, it Is

sometmies desirable to administer the glu 
cose intravenously A dose of 0 5 gm per 
kilogram of ideal body weight is usual and 
IS given intravenously by the physician as 
a 20 per cent solution One ml of 50 per 
cent glucose per kilogram is diluted to 
about 21 times its volume with irjectable 
distilled water and this is given by intra 
venous dnp at a constant rate such that 
the total volume is given m a half hour 
(eg for a 70 kg patient 70 ml of 50 
per cent glucose is diluted to about 175 ml 
and given at the rate of 6 ml per minute)

Amatuzio (1953) has used the disappear 
ance rate of glucose from the blood follow

nosis of diabetes 

The patient should have been on an ade 
quate carbohydrate intake 

Take a blood sample for determination of 
fasting blood sugar (FBS) (5 ml m an 
oxalated bottle protect against glucolysis) 
Inject 25 gm of glucose as a 30 per cent 
solution in water vviihm four minutes (25 
ml o! 50 per cent glucose and disuUed 
water q s up to 40 to 45 ml in each of 
two 50 ml synnges)

Calculation From each blood sugar 
value subtract the FBS value giving the 
“glucose excess ” Plot these values on the 
logarithmic scale of semilogarithmic paper

Determine from the graph the time at 
which the blood sugar is one half the maxi

Identtfication of Urtne Sugars 

Some of the sugars that may occur jn 
urine (glucose fructose galactose lactose 
sucrose and xyloketose) can be distln 


Laboratorv Methods 

gmshed on the basis of tests or properties 
described earher All the sugars men 
tioned except sucrose are reducing sugars 
and will therefore give positive tests 
with Benedicts reagent or Clinitest The 
sugars other than glucose will usually not 
be present in amounts large enough to 
give more than a 2+ reducing test If a 
positive test for reducing sugar is obtained 
the next step would be to try Climstix (as 
such or m Unstix or Combistix) orTes Tape 
if these give a positive test glucose is 
present Other sugars may also be present 
Remember that a positive test for one com 
pound does not rule out other compounds 
that do not respond to that test If the 
enzyme test is negative glucose is absent 
and reduction was due to some other sugar 

Kciose (Lasker and Enklewitz test) 
Fructose or xyloketose can be shown by 
treating 1 ml of the unne with 5 ml of 
Benedicts qualitative reagent at 55® C for 
10 minutes or overnight at room tempera 
ture 

Pentoses Xyloketose nbose and other 
pentoses wiU give a red color with Taubers 
lest To 0 2 ml of unne add 1 ml of 2 per 
cent benzidine m glacial acetic acid Heat 
to boiling cool m running water and add 
2 ml of water If large amounts of protein 
are present remove by adding to urine an 
equal volume of 10 per cent trichloroacetic 
aad mix and filler use filtrate for the test 

Fermentation Test Rub up a piece of 
fresh bakers yeast the size of two peas or 
a chinabcrry with about 30 ml of unne 
Completely fill a 6 x 50 mm hpless test 
tube with the mixture and pour the re 
moinder into a 15 to 18 mm test tube 
Cover the small tube with a small piece of 
paper invert and drop into the larger tube 
Let stand for an hour or two at 35 to 40® 
C or for several hours at room temperature 
Examine for gas accumulation within the 
small tube Fermentation indicates the 
presence of glucose fructose or sucrose 
The presence of nonfermentable sugars can 
be shown by centrifuging the mixture after 
fermentation is complete and applying 
Benedicts test which will still be positive 
if galactose lactose or a pentose is present 

Qirovnaiogtapb) (cf p 412) offers a 
more definitive method of demonstrating 
the presence of sugars in unne Owing to 
the relatively low RFs of the sugars the

Ing chromatograph), allowing the solvent 
to drip ofT the lower edge of the sheet or 
by ascending chromatography with the pad 
technique (a second sheet or two of paper 
is folded and clipped against the top of the 
chromatogram sheet) This allows more 
soUent to move across the sheet, moving 
the sugars further and improving separa 
tion For this the chromatogram may he 
suspended from a glass rod held by rubber 
or polytth>lene caps inside a circular or 
rectangular glass jar Or a long paper strip 
may be folded into a rack made from plastic 
draper) pleatcrs to decrease the vertical 
length 

Whatman No 4 paper Is suitable for this 
chromatograph) when a rapid ilow of sou 
ent is desired Flow will he more rapid along 
fbc major a\ls of the biicrs of paper 
This can be determined by admitting water 
slowly onto the paper to form a spot The 
longer diameter of the elliptical spot indi- 
cates the major axis of the fibers If dc 
sccnding chromatography Is to be used and 
the solvent Is allowed to drip off the end 
of the paper, the lower end of the paper 
should be serrated with a point directly 
below each spot at which a s-implc is to 
be placed 

Prepare a standard by dissolving 50 mg 
of each of the sugars that are suspected 
in the urine in 10 ml of normal sugar free 
urine, prepare another standard with glu 
COSO only 

On the paper sheet or strip draw a soft 
pencil line about an inch from one end 
Mark this line at 1 Inch intervals With a 
fine pipet apply 5 to 50 microHicrs (0 005 
to 0 05 ml ) of the urine being investigated 
and of the standards to marks on the paper 
sheet The amount used will depend on 
the concentration of (he sugars Tiic spots 
should be kept small If necessary apply 
the solution repenicdly, drying tlie spot 
between applications A hair dryer is con 
venient for this 

After the sample spots are dry, place the 
paper in position in the jar and dip the end 
vv here the samples were placed in the solvent 
taking care that the spots remain well 
above the liquid Apply the pad to the upper 
end if one is being used A suitable solvent 
for separating sugars especially when the 
pad technique or descending chroinatog 
raphy is used is prepared by adding 20 ml 
of water to 80 ml of isopropanol, it has 
the advantages of being nontoxic and of 
having no obnoxious odor 

Cover the jar and allow the run to pro 


ceed overnight (16 to 20 hrs ) If pentose 
Is present, a shorter run may be necessary 
At the end of the run remove the paper and 
hang it up to dry 

To locate the sugars prepare an aniline 
diphcnylaminc reagent dissolve 10 ml of 
aniline and 10 ml of diphenylamme (use 
caution in handling these toxic materials) 
In 100 ml of acetone and add 10 ml of 
85 per cent phosphoric acid The amme 
phosphates may precipitate on mixing but 
should return to solution after shaking or 
after the addition of a few drops of water 

When the paper is dry pour the location 
reagent into a suitable trav and dip the 
paper through it Now hang the paper or 
lay it on another clean paper and heal it 
In an oven at 95 to 100'’ C for a few

LIPIDS 

Lipids are organic compounds contaimng 
mostly carbon and hydrogen along with 
some oxygen, some of the compound lipids 
also contain nitrogen and phosphorus In 
general the hpids are insoluble m water 
and soluble in organic solvents, such as 
hydrocarbons (petroleum ether, gasoline 
and benzene), halogenated hydrocarbons 
(chloroform carbon tetrachlonde, and 
dichloroeihane) and ether They are the 
greasy substances Chemically they are 
fatty acid esters or compounds that can 
form such esters 

Lipids are usually classified into three 



Clinical Diagnosis b\ Laboratory ^^ETUons 


424 

groups simple, compound or conjugated 
and den\ed The simple lipids are esters of 
fatty acids and an alcohol, they include the 
true fats or neutral fats, the waxes, and the 
sterol esters 

The true fats are esters of glycerol with 
three molecules of fatty acid and are there- 
fore also called tngljcendes The three 
molecules of fatty acid may be the same or 
different The fats are named from the fatty 
acids that compose them Thus, a trigly- 
ceride contaming three molecules of oleic 
aad IS called tnolem one containing one 
molecule of palmitic acid and two of steanc 
acid is palmitodisteann 

Fattj Acids The fatty acids of natural 
fats are mostly straight chained and have 
an even number of carbon atoms Some 
have one two or three double bonds The 
human body seems to be able to introduce 
one double bond into a fatty acid but not 
more There is some indication that the 
body requires a small amount of the di 
and tnunsaturated fatty acids these must 
therefore be included tn the diet and are 
called “essential" fatty aads The amount 
required is small and the likelihood of die 
tary insufficiency is remote Nfost of the 
fatty acids of body fats are 16 to 20 carbons 
in length with smaller amounts of the ones 
with shorter chains The commonest are 
palmitic (16 carbon saturated), steanc (18 
carbon, saturated), and oleic (18 carbon, 
one double bond ) 

There has been considerable mterest 
recently in the degree of unsaturation of 
dietary fati> acids since there is evidence 
that blood cholesterol is increased by in 
creased amounts of dietary saturated fatly 
acids and decreased by dietary fatty acids 
with two or more double bonds Animal 
fats are higher in saturated fatly acids and 
vegetable fats higher in unsaturated Hydro- 
genation as used in converting hquid 
vegetable fats (com oil cottonseed oil and 
coconut oil ) mto solid shortenings for 
cooking (e g , Spry, Cnsco, and Flair), de 
creases the unsaturation of the fatty acids 

There is normall) a small amount of 
free fatty acids (FFA) in the blood that 
are also called unestenfied fattj acids 
(UFA) or nonestenfied fatt} acids (NEFA) 
This fraction is apparently much more im 
portant in metabolism than its small 
amount would indicate, its turnover rate 
is high 1 e a large amount is formed and 
removed per unit of time The raetabobsm 
of FFA seems to be related to carbohydrate 
metabobsm 


Besides the fats the class of simple lipids 
includes the waxes These are esters of a 
fatty acid with a monohydne alcohol of 
high molecular weight Spermaceti, for ex- 
ample. IS largely an ester of palmitic acid 
with the 16-carbon alcohol cetjl alcohol 
beeswax is nch in the palmitic ester of 
mjricyl alcohol, which has 30 carbons 

A special group of the waxes is that in 
which the alcohol is cholesterol — the 
cholesterol esters which occur in the blood 
The cholesterol esters of the blood are 
formed in the hver, the portion of the 
total cholesterol of the blood that is m the 
ester form is an indication of liver function 

The coniugaied lipids contain a nonbpid 
material combined m the molecule Some 
contain phosphonc acid some contam a 
nitrogenous moiety, and some contain a 
sugar, not all contain glycerol 

One group of conjugated bpids is the 
phosphobpids These contain phosphonc 
acid in place of one of the fatty acids esten- 
fied on glycerol, attached to the phosphonc 
acid IS also a nitrogenous compound In 
ieathm the nitrogen portion is cbobne 
(tnmethylhjdroxyethylammonium hydrox 
ide), in cephabn it is senne (a-ammO(8 
hydroxypropjomc acid) or ethanolamine 
Owing to the possible vanauons in the two 
fatty acids there are many different cepha 
lins and lecithms Other phosphobpids 
rarely of concern in the cbnical laboratory 
perhaps because of our ignorance, arc the 
plasmalogens, the sphingomyelins and the 
phosphoinositides The &st are similar to 
lecithin or cephabn except that one of the 
fatty acids is replaced by an aldehyde, the 
second contain no glycerol and the third 
contain no nitrogen 

The cerebrosides or glycobpids contain 
no glycerol or phosphorus but include a 
sugar, usually galactose and sometimes 
glucose 

The denied lipids include the fatty aads 
just discussed and the sterols The sterols 
broadly defined, are high molecular weight 
alcohols mcluding the aliphatic wax alco- 
hols However, the term is commonly re 
siricted to compounds having a structure 
similar to that of cholesterol There are 
many physiologically important compounds 
with a similar structure, which, lacking an 
alcohol group, are not sterols These com 
pounds are called steroids The steroid 
nucleus is the cyclopentanoperhydrophenan 
ihiene group (Phenanthiene is a three- 
ring homolog of benzene Verhydro means 
that all the double bonds are hydrogenated

The steroids also include the bile acids 
and a number of hormones (estrogens 
androgens adrenal corlicoids) The bile 
acids have no double bonds have a liydroxjl 
group on carbon 3 and ma> hive one or 
two more on carbons 7 or 12 Thc> also 
have a side chain on carbon 17 containing 
five carbons the terminal one of which is

This can be done by extracting the lipids 
from the serum punfymg them evaporat 
ing off the solvent and weighing the Iipid 
residue A simpler method which gives 
cbnically useful results is that of Kunkel 


Ehrens and Eiscnmenger (1948) it is 
based on the capacity of a saline phenol 
solution to precipitate the lipids specifically 
from scrum the amount of hpld is meas 
ured by the turbidity thus produced 

Reagent 

Dissolve 12 gm of sodium chloride in 
water add 1 ml of liquid phenol and dilute 
to 100 ml Keep in the refrigerator 

PROCEDURE Measure 0 25 ml of fasting 
scrum into 4 5 ml of reagent (or 0 1 ml 
serum into 1 8 ml reagent) Mix Let stand 
30 minutes shake and read with the red 
(No 66) filter or at the wave length used 
for thymol turblditv having set zero ab 
sorbanec with the reagent 

Calculation Convert colorimeter 
reading to Maclagin units as in the de 
termination of thymol turbidity The re 
suit may be reported thus or converted to 
mg per cent total lipid by multiplying by 
16 6 and adding 267 Normal is 16 to 30 
units or 530 to 765 mg per cent 

Interpretation After a mixed meal 
containing fat the serum lipid concentra 
lion gradually nscs for three to five hours 
Jletum to normal may require as long as 
ten hours A disproportionate increase in 
neutral fat causes turbidity or lactescence 
of the scrum If there is a proportionate 
Increase in phospholipids the fat is kept 
in solution and the milkiness does not 
appear Scrum lipids arc normally almost 
entirely combined with protein to form bpo 
protein Tht lactescence is due to submiero 
scopic globules of fat or chylomicrons The 
scrum lipids are elevated even in the post 
absorptive state m persons with uncon 
trolled diabetes mellitus in persons with 
ketosis from other causes such as starva 
tlon and m persons with nephrosis or the 
nephrotic stage of glomerulonephnlis In 
obstruction of the biliary system and usu 
ally In hypothyroidism scrum cholesterol is 
increased There are two idiopathic diseases 
of Iipid metabolism in one the cholesterol 
is increased and in the other the tnglycer 
ides arc increased

Quantitativ’e Determmation 
OF Fecal Fat 

Collection of the Speamen The result 
of this determination is usually expressed 
as grams per 100 gm of dry specimen if 
the sample represents a 24 hour period, the 
result could be expressed as grams per 24 
hours If it IS desired to know the wet 
weight of the specimen or the amount of 
fat per 100 gm of specimen as voided It 


will be necessary to protect the sample from 
drying out before the analysis is made 
Some of the containers commonly used for 
fecal samples do not give this protection 
A suitable container is a 16-oJ glass jar 
havnng a screw cap as large as the full di 
ameter of the jar such as that supplied by 
W H Curtm 8c Co under their number 
12353 IOC (but not listed in their catalog) 
for about 30 cents each If it is desired to 
know the weight of the specimen as for 
24 hour samples the capped jar can be 
weighed before bemg given to the ward 
personnel or patient and the weight can 
be recorded on a label on the jar reweigh 
tag on return will then give specimen 
weight without transfer 

Principle of Dciermioation (Neufeld 
1952) By healing a weighed acidified 
fecal specimen under xylene in a reflux 
apparatus with a moisture trap it is pos 
sible to extract simultaneously the fat and 
fatty acids and to determine the moisture 
content After evaporation of an aliquot of 
the xylene and purification with petroleum 
ether the residue is weighed If desired 
the residue can be dissolved in warm 
alcohol and titrated with standard alkali to

Apparntus 

1. The special apparatus used Is 
shown in Fig. 8-21. A heating mantle and 
variable transformer are highly desirable 
for heating the boiling flask; if these are 
used, the flask should have a round bottom. 
A hot plate Or even a burner (hazard: 
xylene is inflammable 1) can be used; in 
such a case a flat-bottom flask may be 
preferable. 

2. Cork ring to set the boiling flask in. 
if round bottom. 

3. Balances (a) to tveigh several hun- 
dred grams to 0.1 gm., (b) to weigh a small 
flask to 0.01 gm., and (c) to weigh a small 
beaker to 0.001 gm. 

Reagents 

1. Hydrochloric acid, concentrated, 
reagent grade. 

2. Xylene, any pure or commercial 
grade toiling between 130 and 150® C. 
(caution: Inflammable). 

3. Petroleum ether, boiling range 40 
to 60’ C. (caution: highly inflammable). 

4. Sodium or potassium hydroxide 
solution, about O.IN, standardized (cf. 
p, 399). 

5. Ethyl alcohol, 05 per cent, or ethyl 
alcohol denatured with isopropyl alcohol. 

6. Phenolphihalcin. 1 per cent in 50 
per cent ethyl alcohol, or thymol blue, 0.2 
per cent in SO pes cent ethyl alcohol. 

(Reagents 4 to G are needed only If frac- 
tionation into fat and free fatty acid is to 
be done.) 

Pbocedure. Weigh the boiling flask and 
a glass stirring rod, which protrudes about 
I to I Inches above the neck of the flask, 
to the nearest 0.1 gm. 


Subtract 2.7 ml. to account for the HCl 
added, 

Re\vcigh the boiling flask and its con- 
tents, including the rod, co the nearest 0.1

Weigh a 50 ml. Erlenmeycr flask to the 
nearest 0.01 gm. 

Transfer 25 ml. of the xylene solution 
to this flask and immediately reweigh to 
obtain the weight of the aliquot. 

Evaporate to dryness on a steam bath, 
using a stream of air (caution; .xylene Is 
inflammable). 

Extract the residue with several small 
portions of petroleum ether (caution: 
highly Inflammable), pooling the ether 
solutions in a graduated 12 or 15 ml centri- 
fuge tube, to a total volume of 12 ml. A 
Pasteur pipet is convenient for these trans- 
fers. 

Cork the tube and centrifuge. 

Weigh a 20 ml. beaker to the nearest 
0.001 gm. 

Pipet 10 ml. of the petroleum ether ex- 
tract into the beaker. 

Evaporate on the steam bath or on a 
warm, cnclosed-clement hotplate (without 
a thermostat and without using the switch 
unless these are explosion-proof) to con- 
stant weight. (The residue will be liquid 
when ivarm.) Record the final weight. 

If it is desired to determine the amount 
of free fatty acid, add a little alcohol and 
warm lo dissolve the residue. Titrate with 
O.IN alkali to the phenolphthalein (pink) 
or thymol blue (blue or green) endpoint 
(since the fat residue is usually yellow, the 
yellow to green endpoint with thymol blue 
may to sharper than the yellow to yelIo%v- 
fsh red with phenolphthalein).

The direct methods while simpler are 
liable to error from bilirubin protein and 
other sources The direct determination of 
cholesterol has been ad\ ocated particular!) 
by commercial interests selling reagents 
for which they will not disclose the comp-w 
sition and for '\hich no careful compan 
son with an extraction method has been 
published E\en though a series of de 
terminations by a direct and by an extrac 
tion method ma) average the same an 
occasional mdividual sample may be quite 
different by the two methods For this 
reason it is felt that a prehmmary pun 
fication step is desirable preferably ex 
traction and possibly precipitation neither 
procedure will eliminate bromide error If 
the ferric chlonde procedure is being used 

The Bloor method adding acetic anhy 
dride and sulfuric acid to a chloroform ex 
tract suffers from the disadvantage that 
free and estenfied cholesterol do not pro 
duce the same amount of color per mol 
and the result will therefore be affected b> 
the ratio of free to ester cholesterol The 
feme chloride reaction has the advantages 
over the Liebermann Burchard method of 
producing an increased color intensity a 
more stable color and an equal chromogenlc 
value of free and esterified cholesterol it 
has the disadvantage of being affected by 
bromide 

The separation of free and estenfied 
chohstero] can be done In sexer&l irajs by 
precipitation of the free cholesterol by 
digitonin or tomatine by selective solvent 
extraction or by chromatography The 
fractionation of total cholesterol is of value 
as a liver function test but it is no better 
than some other tests that are easier to do 

Fekric Chloride Method 
(Crmijord 195S Chiamort 1959 
Legier 1959) 

Principle In the method to be detailed 
two alternative prehmmary steps are de 
senbed In one the free and ester choles 
terol are extracted from serum and the 
proteins are precipitated with Bloor’s mix 
ture of alcohol and ether or with isopro 
panol A portion of this after or without 
evaporation to dryness is treated with a 
feme chlonde aceuc acid reagent (which 
is more stable than the feme chlonde 
sulfuric acid reagent sometimes used) In 
the other the serum is treated directly with 
the feme chlonde-acetic acid reagent and 
the proteins are precipitated by heating 
the mixture In either case sulfunc acid 


Is next added heat is evolved and a color is 
produced — hght brown at first turning to 
an intense reddish purple In microadapta 
tions the amount of heat produced may not 
be sufficient to raise the temperature to 
the degree required for full color develop 
ment in this case the tubes are immersed 
bnefly in a boiling water bath 

Choice between the alternatives will de- 
pend on convemence personal preference 
and the amount of color obtained in the 
blanks

Interpretation On an average mixed diet 
the daily amount of fecal fat may range

25 per cent of the dry weight of the stool 
Usually some 50 to 80 per cent of this Is 
split fat (free fatty acids plus soaps) 

This normal fecal fat equals in amount 
about 5 to 10 per cent of the amount of 
fat in the diet Actually most of ft is not 
directly dietary in origin 2 gm or more 
may be excreted even in starvation Some 
of the endogenous fat is bacterial but most 
is free and onginates from the bile and

The total fat excretion is increased In

or m intestinal wall deficiency (sprue lack 
of absorption) when the diet contains 50 
gm or more of fat Theoretically the pro- 
portion of spilt fat to neutral fat should

transit gives opportunity for spbtting even 
by decreased pancreatic secretion and in

Ferric Cheoride Method 
(Cranford, 1958 Clnamon, 1959, 
Lcffler, 1959) 

Principle In the method to be detailed 
two alternative preliminary steps are de 
scribed In one the free and ester choles 
terol are extracted from serum and the 
proteins are precipitated with Bloor s mix 
ture of alcohol and ether or with isopro 
panel A portion of this after or without 
evaporation to dryness is treated with a 
feme chloride acetic acid reagent (which 
is more stable than Uie feme cUonde 
sulfuric acid reagent sometimes used) In 
the other the serum is treated directly with 
the ferric chloride acetic acid reagent and 
the proteins are precipitated by heating 
the mixture In either case sulfuric atad 


is next added heat is evolved and a color is 
produced — light brown at first turning to 
an intense reddish purple In microadapta 
tions the amount of heat produced may not 
be sufficient to raise the temperature to 
the degree required for full color develop 
ment in this case the tubes are immersed 
bnefly in a boiling water bath 

Choice between the alternatives will de- 
pend on convenience personal preference 
and the amount of color obtamed in the 
blanks 

Reagents

Apparatus 

To a\oid undesirable bubble forma 
tion It IS preferable to mix the concen 
trated sulfuric aad uith the overlying fer 
nc chlonde-acetic acid reagent without 
shaking the test tube This can be done 
by using a large (25 mm ) test tube and 
swirling or by stoppering the tube and 
inverting Rubber or cork stoppers are unde 
sirable because of the hkelihood of mter 
fenng contamination Two possible solu 
tions are to close the test tubes with poly 
ethylene caps (eg Curtin 18824 or Aloe 
78305) or to use tubes with Teflon lined 
screw caps (Kimble 45066 A) Another 
means for mixing less satisfactory than 
inversion is to use a footed stirring rod 

Evaporation 

To aid the evaporation of the solvent 
when the tubes axe immersed in a 60 to 
80 C bath a stream of air or nitrogen 
IS useful This can be obtained from a 
compressed air line a laboratory air com 
pressor (Cole Fanner offers their small 
7082 for about S40) a cjbnder of com 
pressed air or nitrogen or an aquanum 
compressor (e g Sears Roebuck & Co 
71 8874 for about S20) A convenient 
manifold is made by inserung 3 inch 
lengths of small stainless steel tubing (or 
hypodermic needles vTith the hubs re 
moved) into a length of heav7 walled mb 
ber tubing this con be laid across the top 
of a row of tubes ui a rack m the water

requires stoppering each tube Leffler

extraction procedure is being used How 
ever in the precipitation procedure the

Direct Determination of Total 
Cholesterol (Moreland 1960) 

In Mew of the interferences that ha\e 
been reported in direct methods of cho- 
lesterol determination such a method can 
not be recommended at present for reliable 
work However there may be occasions 
when the simplicity of these methods out 
weighs their errors such as in screening 
tests or in a senes of determinations at 
short intervals in which changes in con 
centration are of prime concern and error 
is likely to be constant 

The occurrence of protein error owing 
to the presence of glyoxjhc acid in the 
acetic acid used can be checked by carry 
ing a purified protein solution such as 
Armours Protein Standard Solution 
through the procedure in place of senim 
and comparing it with the blank Use of a 
control serum such as Hyland Clinical 
Chemistry Control will also give indication 
of error arising from the reagents Neither 
of these controls will of course climinnic 
error owing to (he scrum such as an in 
creased bilirubin or hemolysis The ciiu 
cism leveled at Liebermann Burchard meth 
ods of bght sensitivity presumably is not 
of concern here since this has been shown 
(Kabara 1934) to have no effect when 
the color produced is read at a wave length 
above 580 tninu The error owing to the 
difference in chromogemcity of free and 
ester cholesterol is also obv laled since this 
occurs only in the presence of chloroform

-Interpretation The normal range 
for total serum cholesterol Is 150 to 250 
mg per cent the free cholesterol making 
up 26 to 30 per cent of this and ester 
cholesterol 70 to 74 per cent 

In obstructive jaundice the total scrum 
cholesterol nses chiefly because of an in 
crease in free cholesterol with a more 
moderate nse in the ester form Thus the 
ester ratio decreases below normal even 
though the amount of ester cholesterol in 
creases 

In liver cell damage the proportion of 
esters decreases The obstructive aspect 
may raise the free cholesterol so that the 
total IS normal With progression of the 
disease both total cholesterol and percent 
age of esters decrease 
■✓■Cholesterol also increases In hypothy 
roidism (he nephrotic syndrome and un 
created diabetes It decreases m hyperthy 
roidlsm Owing to the influence of other 
factors the cholesterol concentration is not

sclerosis seems to be related both to hyper 
cholesterolemia and to the increase in the 
hghter lipoproteins (the “Sf 12 20” class) 

Cholesterol concentration and solubihty 
seem also to be related to phosphohpid con 
centration An increase in phospholipid 
tends to increase cholesterol concentration 
a decrease leads to deposition of cholesterol 

Because of tlic combination of cholesterol 
in the lipoproteins perhaps ivith a protec

other lipids is not extractable from serum

alcohol to free the lipid from the protem 
and extract it 

NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS 

The classification of foodstuffs into car 
boh>drates fats and protems is sometimes 
earned over to the multitude of orgamc 
compounds occurring in the bod> Here 
however vve encounter man) compounds 
that do not fit the definitions of these three 
main classes This is particularly true of a 
large number of nUrogcn<ontamng com 
pounds which are in general denved from 
protems but which urdike the proteins are 
of relatively small molecular weight being 
cr)Stalloids rather than colloids They 
therefore pass through dialyzing mem 
branes and most of them pass through the 
capillar) walls cell walls and the glomer 
ulus The nitrogenous compounds of the 
body Include the protems and the nonpro* 
tern mtrogenous constituents The protems 
mclude the hemoglobms fibrinogen and 
the serum proteins the last are somewhat 
arbitrarily divided irto albumm and globu 
hn and further into ai a (3 and 
f globuhns The nonprotein nitrogenous 
compounds include a large number and 
vanety of compounds those most com 
monly determined m a chnical chemistry 
laboratory and to be described in this chap- 
ter are urea creatme creatuune unc acid 
the ammo acids ammonia the porphyrins 
and porphobihnogen others are considered 
in the chapters on liver function and hor 
mones 

rrotems 

Protems are high molecular weight 
orgamc compounds characterized by con 
taimng nitrogen As noted previously some 
carbohydrates and lipids contain nitrogen 
atoms but it is only with the proteins that 
this element is typical The proteins on 


hydrolysis yield o-atmno acids having an 
ammo ( — NH^) group attached to the carbon 
next to the carboxyl group that is a car 
boxyl and an ammo group are both 
attached to the carbon next to the end the 
alpha carbon One of the simplest ammo 
acids is alamne CHj — CHNH — COOH 
About 20 other different ammo acids occur 
in natural protems These differ from ala 
mne m having other configurations in place 
of the CHj — group These may be simply 
a hydrogen (as in glycme) an aliphatic 
ora sulfur-containing chain or an aromatic 
or a heterocychc ring structure Some 
ammo acids contam an additional carboxyl 
or amino group beyond those attached to 
the alpha carbon These make the amino 
acids containmg them more acid or more 
basic than the average Other groups occur 
nng m ammo acids mclude hydroxyl 
phenyl sulfhydryl indole and imidazole 
In the protems ammo acids are combined 
together to form polypeptide chams by con 
densation of the a ammo group of one 
wath the a^:a^boxyl of another to form the 
pepude linkage

Protems thus have a backbone of repeating

R 

links variation exists because of the 
differing R groups which represent the 
portion of the ammo acids beyond the a 
carbon The patterns of the amino acids in 
the polypeptide chains appear to be de 
termined by the nbonucleic acids of the 
cells Not only is there variation in what 
ammo acids make up the chain but there 
IS also cross linkage between active groups 
not involved m the peptide link espe 
cially — SH groups which are oxidized to 
— S — S — Imks 

Tlie classification of protems is not an 
easy matter because of the many unrelated 
charactenstics that these compounds show 
A grouping based on one property may be 
unsatisfactory when another property is 
considered Thus albumins may be defined 
as proteins that are soluble in water and 
globulins as those that require a little salt 
to make them dissolve or we may say 
that albumins require saturation of their 
solution with ammonium sulfate to pre 
cipitate them whereas globulins will be 


434 


Clinical Diaonosis b> Laboratory Methods 


precipitated by half saturation Y'lih the 
same salt But what, then of proteins that 
are soluble in pure %\ater but that arc salted 
out b> half saturation with ammonium 
sulfate? 

The proteins are usually dinded into 
a simple proteins contaimng only 
ammo acids 

b conjugated proteins containing also 
some nonamino acid prosthetic group and 
c the derived proteins which are 
really not proteins at all but partially 
hjdrolj-zed proteins 

The simple proteins include 

1 albumins soluble in water and salt 
solutions 

2 globulins soluble in dilute salt 
solutions 

3 albuminoids Insoluble in water and 
salt soluuons 

The albumins and globulins are heat 
coagulable that is they are made less 
soluble h^ heating in solution and prccipl 
tate out if the pH of the solution is near 
that at which there is no net ionic charge 
on the molecule (the isoelectric point or 
lEP) 

The globulins will precipitate if the salt 
content of their soluuon is decreased by 
dialysis or by simple dilution with water 
This IS why serum becomes turbid if di 
luted with water rather than with sabnc 

Albumin and especially globulin arc not 
single protein species but mixtures Electro- 
phoresis or precipitation by different salt 
concentrations shows many globubns to 
exist in serum The separation of serum 
proteins into “albumin" and “globulin" was 
for many years (and still is in some labora 
tones) done by Howes method of precipita 
non at 21 5 per cent Na-SO, Careful 
studies particularly by electrophoresis have 
shown that this salt concentration leaves 
most of the « globulm in solution and a 
concentration of 26 per cent gives truer 
separation Electrophoresis or the use of 
several salt concentrations allows us to 
separate the gloDulins into commonly, 
o, p and T These fractions are not 
sharply defined and for a given scrum 
sample different values will be obtained 
with the several differently graded salt con 
centrations that have been proposed even 
electrophoresis is not definiuve, different 
results being obtained with different buffers 
and supporting media (e g , paper, starch 
and agar) 

The conjugated proteins may be div’uied 
into 

I nucleoproteins containing nucleic 


acid (made up of nbose or deoxyribose, 
punnes and pyTimidmes and phosphoric 
acid) 

2 mucoproteins containing sugar 
amines, sugars, and uronic acids 

3 glycoproteins containing only a 
small amount of carbohydrate 

4 lipoproteins (prosthetic group a 
Lpid) 

5 chromoproteins (eg, hemoglobin) 

6 metalloprotclns (prosthetic group 
a metallic ion) 

7 phosphoproteins 

'^ZTERMINATIOV OF SERUM PROTEINS 
The hemo^obins are discussed in Chap- 
ter 4 We wall confine our attention to 
fibrinogen and the major serum proteins 
in this chapter The difference between 
serum and plasma protems is, of course 
fibrinogen since this protein separates out 
as fibrin in the clotting process Fibrinogen 
cannot however, be measured by determin 
mg the protein content of plasma and 
serum and subtracimg Since the amount 
of fibnnogen is small the possible error 
in each total protein determination is large 
compared to the fibrinogen concentration 
Also the anticoagulant usually causes a 
shift of fluid from cells to plasma that 
would diminish the difference between total 
protein of the two fluids Plasma is the 
liquid portion, which on standmg or on 
centrifuging separates from a sample of 
blood to which an anticoagulant was added 
serum is ibe liquid portion that separates 
from clotted blood 

—.A number of methods have been used 
for determining the total amount of protem 
In serum or in other biologic samples One 
of the classic methods is the Kjeldahl pro-/ 
cedure m which the sample is digested with 
concentrated sulfunc acid and heat thereby 
converting the nitrogen of the protein and 
of roost of the other nitrogenous compounds 
into ammonium sulfctc The ammoma can 
be determined by rnakmg the solution 
alkaline, distilling it into acid and titratmg 
or by lettmg it react with'^Nesslers reagent 
to develop a color that can be measured If 
there are nonprolem nitrogenous com 
pounds in the sample these must be cor 
rected for, this is usually done by removang 
the protem by preapitauon and determin 
mg the nonprotein mtrogen "tNPN) and 
subtracting it from the protein ratrogen 
Knowing the amount of nitrogen denved 
from the protein in the sample we can 
calculate the amount of protem present if 
we know the proportion of nitrogen in the 



CLISICAL CHfMlS>TR\

protein It has been traditional to take this 
as 16 per cent and therefore to multiply 
protein nitrogen by 6 25 to obtain protein 
Unfortunately not all proteins contain the 
same proportion of nitrogen and this factor 
is not apphcable to all proteins It is not 
actually correct for human serum proteins 
and the factor \anes for different protein 
fractions as shown by Sunderman (1957) 
and others For human serum total protein 
the factor is 6 54 

Other methods for determimng protein 
have included weighing after purification 
and drying a tedious procedure, measuring 
the turbidity produced when a precipitating 
agent is added to a solution of the protein 
a method frequently used for unne and 
cerebrospinal fluid, measuring the specific 
gra\aty or refracme index of the protem 
solution parameters likely to be affected by 
nonprotan materials and measuring some 
charactenstic group or Imkage of the pro 
tein molecule such as hjdroxyphenyl 
groups or peptide bnkages 

One of the difficulties in the quantitauve 
determination of proteins lies in the quab 
tame changes m the proteins that occur 
in disease If a new protein appears that 
has a different nitrogen or tyrosine con 
tent methods based on these components 
uoll ghe results that are affected by this 
quabtative change and mil not reflect only 
the change in amount of protein 

The so*called ‘Inuret reaction uses an 
alkaline copper sulfate reagent It depends 
on the peptide links that characterize pro- 
tein and appears to be very little affected 
by qualitatne changes in the protein

Total Protein and Albumin (RcinhoJd, 1953) 

The procedure just described for al* 
bumin is much simpler, but for those who 
prefer a salting out technique such a 
method will now be described This pro- 
cedure uses the sodium sulfate sulfite solu- 
tion descnbed by Reinhold which, when 
properly used, gives results approximating 
those obtained by electrophoresis Most 
laboratories formerly used, and some still 
do, the 23 per cent sodium sulfate solution 
of Howe, however, this gives high values 
for albumin and low for globulin 
Reagents 

Use reagents 1 to 4 as for total serum 
protein 

S Sulfate sulfite solution Place 208 
gm of anhydrous sodium sulfate and 70 
gm of sodium sulfite in a 2 liter beaker 
or flask 

To 900 ml of water in a separate con 
tamer add 2 ml of concentrated sulfuric 
acid 

Add the acidified water suddenly to the 
salts with stirring (This is a good place 
for a magnetic mixer ) When the salts are 
dissolved, transfer to a volumetric flask 
and dilute with water to 1 bter The pH is 
not critical if it is above 7 (Before measur- 
ing pH, dilute 1 ml to 25 ml with water ) 
Store m glass or polyethylene stopper 
bottles at a temperature above 25® C 

Procedure If temperatures faU below 
25® C , precipitation of sodium sulfate may 
occur 

To 7 5 ml of sulfate sulfite solution in a 
J5 X 125 mm test tube add 0 5 ml of serum 
with mixing 

Muc by inversion 

Imme^ately remove 2 ml of the mixture 
to another test tube or a cuvet (for total 
protem determination) 


To the remaining 6 ml add 2 to 3 ml 
of ether 

Inter! the tube (upside down and back) 
ten times in 30 seconds (do not shake or 
albumin may be precipitated) 

Centrifuge 

Tilt the tube to permit insertion of the 
tip of a transfer pipet past the globubn 
cake 

Without transferring any of the pre 
cipitate, remove 2 ml of the clear albumin 
solution to another test tube or cuvet 
Measure 2 ml of sulfite sulfate solution 
into a tube for blank 

To each tube add 4 ml of biuret reagent* 
and 2 to 3 ml of ether 

Stopper, shake vigorously (‘caution 
strong alkab), and centrifuge 

Set up standards also, using procedure 
for total protein only 

Set to zero absorbance with blank, using 
green No 54 filter, or (for better sensitiv 
ity) a No 56 or 59 filter or at 580 m/x

Quantitati\e Determination 
OF Protein in 
Cerebrospinal Fluid 
Precise Method Because of the low con 
centration of protein normally found in 
cerebrospinal fluid the biuret method used 
fot blood serum is not sufficiently scnsiti\e 
Folm and Ciocalteu in 1927 described the 
use of a phosphomolybdic phosphotungsUc 
acid reagent for the determination of sub 
stances which like protein contain tyro- 
sine and tryptophane In 1951 Lowry and 
his colleagues improied the sensitnity and 
usefulness of the reagent by pretreatmg 
the protein with an alkaline copper (biuret) 
reagent This has been applied to the de 
termination of protein in cerebrospinal 
fluid (Daughaday et al 1952) 

Heaqents 

1 Alkabne tartrate solution Dissolve 
20 gm of sodium carbonate and 0 5 gm 
of sodium or potassium tartrate m a liter 
of 0 IN NaOH 

2 Copper sulfate solution Dissolve 1 
gm of the pentahydrate m water and dilute 
to 1 liter 

3 Alkaline copper reagent Add 45 ml 
of the alkaline tartrate solution to 5 ml of 
the copper sulfate solution Mix Make 
fresh daily 

4 Stock phenol reagent This is one 
you may wish to purchase In a lU or 2 
bter round bottom ground joint flask dis 
solve 100 gm of sodium tungstate (dihy 
drate) and 25 gm of sodium molybdate 
(dihydrate) in 700 ml of water Add 50 
ml of 85 per cent phosphoric acid and 100 
ml of concentrated hjdrochlonc acid 
Insert a water cooled reflux condenser and 
boil gently for ten hours Turn off the heat 
and remove condenser Add 150 gm of 
lithium sulfate wash down with 50 ml 
of water When this has dissolved add 5 
to 10 drops of 30 per cent H O or of 
bromine Boil gently for 15 minutes without 
a condenser to remove the excess oxidizing 
agent (if bromine was used be sure to 
have a good fume hood) The solution 
should be clear golden yellow If it is 
greenish repeat the peroxide or bromine 
treatment Cool the reagent to room temper 
ature and dilute to 1 liter Filter if neces 
sary through glass wool or a sintered glass 
filter Store in a brown bottle (or lo the 


dark) with a glass or polyethylene stopper 

5 Dilute phenol reagent To 1 ml of 
the stock reagent add 50 ml of water and 
titrate with standard 0 1 N sodium hydroxide 
to a phcnolphthalein endpoint Now dilute 
the stock reagent with water so that 1 ml 
is equivalent to 9 ml of 0 1 N NaOH (e g 
if the titration required 22 ml of 0 1 N 
NaOH 9 volumes of the stock reagent 
should be diluted to 22 volumes or dilute 
90 ml of stock reagent to ten times the 
volume of the sodium hydroxide used in 
the titration) A dilution to about double 
volume will usually be required Each new 
batch of stock reagent should be titrated 

6 Protein standard Use the Armour 
Protein Standard Solution or some normal 
serum on which the protein concentration 
has been determined Dilute with 0 85 or 
0 9 per cent sodium chloride to give a 40 
mg per cent (0 04 per cent) protein solu 
tion (this would require just over 0 5 ml 
diluted to 100 ml ) This standard may be 
preserved with benzoic acid Or use a 13 
mg per cent tyrosme solution in 0 1 N 
hydrochloric acid (this is equivalent to 50 
mg per cent protein) 

Procedure To 5 ml of the alkaline 
copper reagent add 0 1 ml of spinal fluid 
(centrifuged if the cell count is elevated) 
or of standard 
Mix 

Let stand 15 minutes 
Add rapidly 0 5 ml of the dilute phenol

Diughada> et al (1952) found the 
blank \alue to range between 3 and 9 mg 
per cent and suggested using 6 mg per cent 
routinely as the blank instead of determining 
it each time Hovseier Siensmark (1958) 
finds the blank may be as high as 45 mg 
per cent and recommends determining it 
for each sample If the result of a detenrn 
nation usmg 6 mg per cent as the blank 
yields a protein talue in the normal range 
then It should be unnecessary to determine 
the blank if the apparent protein concen 
tration is ele\atcd then the blank should 
be measured 

Intebpretation Normal values are 
in the range of 20 to 45 mg per cent 
Aside from the obvious elevation caused 
by hemorrhage into the cerebrospinal fluid 
or during puncture the greatest increase in 
protem occurs in memngitis with values of 
500 to 2000 mg per cent Concentrations 
of 50 to 500 mg per cent may be seen in 
the nonpurulent mcningitides such as 
tuberculous and syphilitic meningitis and 
in aseptic meningeal reaction A moderate 
elevation may occur in various conditions 
Involving the neural tissue of the brain or

Compare after five minutes with stand 
ards made from 1 2 and 4 droos of 7 mg 
per cent tyrosine in 0 1 N HCl If the drops 
of standard are of the same size as of the 
spinal fluid these standards will be eqmv

of 1 M acetic acid and the tube is well 
stoppered 

Turbidometrtc method for cerebrosfnual 
fluid protein (Denis and Ayer 1920) A

Quantitative Determination of Fibrino 
GEN IN plasma (Parfentjcv et of, 1953) 

Fibrinogen is the soluble protein of cir 
culatmg blood and of plasma that is con 
verted in the clotting process to the insolu 
ble fibrin which forms the network of the 
blood clot When there is insufficient forma 
tion of fibrinogen by the Uver or excessive 
fibrin formation and deposition the blood 
will not clot and hemorrhage may result 
However it must be remembered that there 
are many other causes of defecUve clotting 
(Chapter 6) 

The simplest and most effective way of 
finding whether there is sufficient fibrino- 
gen in the blood to form a clot is to draw 
some blood without an anticoagulant place 
It In a test tube and let it stand five or ten 
minutes Then turn the tube over Jf the 
blood stavs in the tube the fibrinogen 
concentration is adequate if it docs not, 
clean up the mess If the blood docs not 
clot there may be a deficiency of fibrinogen 
or of one of the other clotting factors (or 
an excess of a clotting inhibitor) In this 
case, or if you do not want to wait ten 


mmutes m the first place add a smaD 
amount of some kind of thrombin prepara 
tion This will speed up clotting and will 
make up for any deficiency in clotting 
factors other than fibnnogen 

If the physician has need for a more 
precise estimate of fibrinogen concentra 
tion. the turbidimetnc precipitation method 
IS simple and satisfactory It is based on 
the fact that fibnnogen Is the most easily 
salted out of all the plasma proteins 
Reagents

Quantitative Determination of 

Mucopbotein (Seromucoid) in 
Serum (Menini et al 1958) 

Mucoprotein is a serum protein that 
contains about 20 per cent carbohydrate 
It makes up 1 to 2 per cent of the serum 
proteins Electrophoretically it travels with 
the oi globulins It remams in solution 
when proteins are precipitated by per 
chloric trichloroacetic or sulfosabcyllc 
acids but is precipitated by phosphotungstic 
acid Tlie latter precipitate can be redis 
solved and the mucoprotein determined by 
reagents for either carbohydrate or protein 
The separation b> use of a protein prccipi 
lant is not clearput about 30 per cent of 
the mucoprotein copredpitating with the 
other proteins The extent of this loss de 
pends on several factors the dilution of 


the serum at the precipitation step the 
method of mixing the serum with the 
perchlonc acid the tune and temperature 
of contact between supernatant and pre

Interpretation The normal range 
for this procedure for mucoproteins is gnen 
as 5 7 to 12 5 mg per cent as tyrosine 
Other methods give quite different normal 
ranges because of the differences in ana 
lytical procedure or in basis of reportmg 
Thus determination of the carbohvdrate 
moiety yields a normal of 12 mg per cent 
as hexose measurement of protein by the 
biuret reagent gives 61 mg per cent as 
protein and determination with the phenol 
reagent leads to 3 4 mg per cent as tyro- 
sine or 80 mg per cent as mucoprotein 
The method just described using the pro 
tem technique of Lowry et al ( 1951 ) gives 
values about three times those obtain^ by 
Wmzlei with the phenol reagent alone, since 
the LowTy procedure involves peptide link 
ages as well as phenol groups 
The serum mucoprotein concentration 
may fluctuate significant!) either above or 
below the normal range Increase is believed 
to be due to release of mucoprotein by tissue 
cells as an acute response to inflammatory 
or proliferative diseases However there 
would seem to be little reason to prefer the 
mucoprotem determination to such an easily 
performed procedure as the sedimentation 
rate for following the course of these dis 
orders 

Decreased values may occur in adreno- 
cortical or hepatic msufficJency It is usu 
all y low in medical jaundice and elevated 
in “surgical ” It has been reported to be 
one of the best tests in mal^g this dis

mg to 37“’ C Sometimes they appear at 
room temperature but refrigeration is usu

Procedure Collect fasUng blood and 
place tube at once in water at 37° C If no 
anticoagulant was added, let clot for one 
hour 

Separate serum or plasma (oxalate, 
citrate, or heparin) at 2000 rpm for ten 
minutes 

Transfer ahquots (about 2 ml ) to each 
of two serology test tubes 

Incubate one at 4° C and the other at 
37° C for four hours 

Cryoglobulins produce no change in 
serum or plasma at 37° C 

In the refngeraled test tube two signifi 
cant changes may be observed 

1 Plasma or serum may appear clotted 
in toto 

2 Plasma or serum may appear divided 
into two layers, the upper containmg 
the normal plasma or serum faintly 
stained with bilirubm, and the lower 
represented by cryoglobulin whitish 
in color, which has precipitated to 
the bottom of the tube

Place the four stnps on the glass plate 
which has been put in position Lea\e 
about between strips and at each edge 
Do not insert the ends of the strips in the 
electrode \essels yet 

Apply serum to the center Imes of the 
strips With a micropipet measure 5 mcl 
and spot it in the center of the Ime or 
measure 10 mcl transfer it to the wires 
of the sample striper (clean with cotton 
moistened with acetone if the serum will 
not spread out) and apply it uniformly 
across the strip pressing oiilj gently 
If you msh to nsualire the albumin to 
see bow far it migrates use a jaundiced 
serum or mix a little of the d>e solution 
with a portion of one of the serums 
E\en if fewer than four samples are being 
run use four stnps on the plates for um 
formity of current density 

^Vhen samples hate been apphed to the 
stnps lay the second plate on top treated 
side down 

Apply six clamps to the plates spacing 
uniformly 

Seal the edges of the plates with vaseline 
or other grease to prevent evaporauon from 
the sides of the outer stnps which would 
djstort the patterns 

Insert the ends of the stnps into buffer 
in the electrode vessels Turn on the power 
supply leaving it on Standby Wait about 
ten minutes for capiUanty to estabhsh 
equihbnum moistening of the paper and 
for the power supply to warm up 
Clamp off the siphon 
Connect the electrodes to the power sup- 
pl) with wires having spnng cbps on the

Turn power supply to On (Caution do 
not touch wires electrodes or stnps while 
power IS on danger of high voltagel) Ad 
just voltage to 300 

Let run until the albunun has migrated 
4 to 5 inches as indicated by the bihrubm 
or dje or four to five hours if no marker 
was used or for 16 to 18 hours at 100 
volts 

Turn off the power supply 
Tear off the portions of the stnps that 
extend bejond the plates 

Remove the clamps and carefully lift 
off the top plate 

Dry the strips m an oven at 100 to 110* 
C for 20 to 30 minutes 

Immerse the dry stnps in the dye solu 
tion for at least slx hours or overnight 


Wash for six minutes each time In two 
changes of wash soluuon 

Immerse in fixauve solution for slx 
minutes 

Blot between clean papers 
Dry in the oven for about 15 minutes 
The blue color may be further intensified 
by exposing the stnps to ammonia vapor 
this IS particularly desirable if a densitom 
eter is to be used but it is unnecessarv 
if elution is to be done 

The stnps may be evaluated by visual 
examination m companson with normal 
serum 

Or the results may he quantitated with 
a densitometer either by pulling the stnp 
through reading at regular intervals and 
plotting a curve or by reading the center 
of each spot or stnp and taking this density 
as proportional to dye and therefore ap- 
proximately proportional to protein 
Or the dye may be eluted and measured 
Cut the stnp at the points where the stain 
mg IS lightest thus obtaming a section 
for each of the five protein fractions Also 
cut a portion of the stnp where there is 
no apparent staining for use as a blank 
If the blank represents an appreciable por 
Qon of the color for any fraction the width 
of the blank section and of each fraction 
should be measured in millimeters and a 
proportional blank subtracted from each 
fraction since tbe fractions will varv in 
width To elute place each section in a 
lest tube or cuvet contaimng 5 ml of 
0 01 N NaOH Let stand 30 minutes with 
occasional mixing Remove the paper 
which should now be white Centnfuge if 
fibers are floating in the eluatc Read each 
tube with a No 54 filter or at 540 m/i 
against a water zero 

Even if the results are quantitated by 
photometry of some type the dved strip 
should be examined Some abnormalities 
show up better qualitatively than quanti 
tatively 

Calculatiov The density of each 
solution (corrected for the blank) divided 
by the sum of the densiues of all fracuons 
times the total protein concentration (de 
termined according to p 435) gives the 
concentration of each protein fraction in 
serum 

The percentage of the total protein that 
each fraction represents can be calculated 
without knowing the total protein How 
ever these values are not so useful as the 
concentrations of each fraction since these 
relative values are interdepcndenL Thus

wth a markedly ele\ated y globulm, if all 
the other fractions were normal, they ivould 
be low as percentages of the total protein 

vfNTERpaETATioN Paper electropho- 
resis of protein is subject to variations 
oHing to type of paper, rate of migration, 
nature and pll of buffer, dye used, and a 
number of other factors One of the most 
disturbing errors is due to the “taihng" 
of albumm Because the albumin, the fast- 
est fraction, moves across the paper, some 
of It IS adsorbed and held by the paper 
Thus, when pure albumin is subjected to 
electrophoresis, there is some protem found 
in the area between the point of applica- 
tion and the bulk of the albumin In elec- 
trophoresis of a mixture of proicms, such 
as serum, this means that results for al 
bumin will be low and those for globulins 
correspondingly high It is reported that 
this tailing does not occur on cellulose 
acetate or agar 

The y-globulin is usually slightly behind 
the pomt of application and will include 
any insoluble protein that has not moved 
The yglobulm has actually moved m the 
electnc field in tlie same direction as the 
albumin Its net backward movement 
demonstrates the electroendosmotic move- 
ment of water in the opposite direction 
because of the interaction of water and 
the paper m the electnc field This move- 
ment of water carries the proteins In the 
opposite direction from the electnc nugra 
tion 

Another variable is the dye binding 
power of the vanous protein fractions, 
which may not all be the same 

The rate of migration (voltage applied) 
and uniformity of pressure on the plates 
will affect the uniformity of migration and 
compactness of the fractions The higher 
voltages produce more heat If poor pat- 
terns are obtained, it may be desirable to 
try a different voltage 

Vanations m either pH, ionic strength 
(concentration), or nature of the buffer wiU 
affect the pattern Higher ionic strengths 
in general give sharper boundaries but in 
Crease the likelihood of denaturation of 
protein Quite different patterns may be 
obtained, for example, with borate EDTA 
buffer, which gives a larger number of 
fractions in both albumm and globuhn 
Variations m the temperature and lime of 
drying may affect the dye binding capacity 
of the -proteins and therefore should be 
kept constant 

The technique of dyeing will have con 
siderable influence on the v alues obtained 


concentration of dye, solvent, time of dye- 
ing, technique of washing the dyed strips, 
method of elution, and solvent. The results 
will also depend on how the quantitation 
is done, if by densitometry, on how the 
intensity of the spots is evaluated, on the 
Imearity of the densitometer response to 
chants in amount of dye. and on the 
decision as to where one fraction ends 
and another begins 

From all this it is seen that the results 
obtained for protein fractionation fay paper 
electrophoresis depend on the technique 
and equipment used Normal values will 
vary and should be established for each 
particular setup For example, four sets 
of normal values for four different tech 
niques are shown in the following table 
The first two columns are those published 
by Spinco (Ehrmantraut, 1938) for their 
A and B procedures respectively, the third 
column contains Sunderman’s v alues 
(1957) for his modification of the Grass

Albumm is rarely elevated It may be 
decreased by low protein intake (malnutri 
uod), by albumm loss from severe hemor- 
rhage or into the urme, or by hver damage 
when synthesis Is impeded It may also be 
decreased m response to an increase in 
globulins In nephrosis, in addition to the 
decreased albumm, there is a marked in 
crease m os-globulin with a decrease in 
the other globulins particularly tlie gam- 
ma In chrome liver disease the y-globulin 
is usually increased 

In multiple myeloma the most charac- 
teristic findmg IS the presence of a band 
of abnormal protein, which has been called 
the Ilf protein It occurs as a rather in- 
tense. fairly narrow band most often found 
with the yglobulins and less often between 
the and t fractions, with the (i or 
rarely between and ^ Sometimes it is 
obvious, sometimes it appears only as an 
mcrcase m one of the fractions It may 
sometimes be seen more clearly on the

Electrophoresis of Proteins of Urine 
AND Other Fluids 

The technique just descnbed for serum 
can also be used for separating the proteins 
of unne and other fluids It is almost 
always necessary to concentrate the unne 
before applying to the paper The protein 
content should be at least 1 5 per cent 

Place an appropnate tolume of urme 
(20 to 40 ml ) into a small cellophane 
bag (a piece of cellophane tubing knotted 
at the end after being netted) and con 
centrate to 2 ml or less according to the 
ongmal protein content by extracting the 
crystalloid solution with a 15 per cent 
solution of carboxymethylcellulose or a 25 
per cent solution of polyvinyl pyrrolldinone 
Place in the refrigerator while concentrat 
mg The technique is useful for studymg 
the unne proteins in some cases of mulaple 
myeloma and may occasionally reveal the 
presence of abnormal proteins when the 
study of serum does not do so 

y^on/)^otetn Nilrogenous Compounds 

In addition to the determination of indi 
vidual compounds of this group the dc 
termination of the total nonprotem nitro* 
gen (NPN ) is sometimes done as a 
measure of kidney function The specific 
deterroinafion of urea or of creatinine if 
urea is markedly elevated is now usually 
preferred 

For the detenmnation of NPN of the spe- 
cific constituents and of a number of non 
protein substances protein must first be 
removed from the blood serum or plasma 
The protems are removed by the addition 
of an anion or cation which combmes 
with the protem to form an insoluble 
product or by the addition of two solutions 
that will react to form a precipitate which 
carries the protein down with it by coprecip- 
nation For a few determmations such as 
calcium and phosphate an acid precipita 
tion is necessary and trichloroacetic aad 
IS commonly used For most however a 
more neutral filtrate is desirable These 
are usually obtained by precipitation with 
tungstic aad or zinc hydroxide Several 
modifications of each have been proposed 
Many other precipitants have been advo- 
cated but have not been generally used 
some are used for specific determinations

Reagents 

1 Sodium tvmgstate 10 per cent Dis 
solve 100 gm of reagent grade (preferably 
“according to Folm”) sodium tungstate di 
hydrate in water and dilute to 1 liter Mix 
Stable 

A satisfactory sodium tungstate gives a 
solution that is neutral or family alkabne to 
phenolphthalein The sample should be dis 
carded if it is so alkaline that more than 
0 4 ml of 0 1 N acid is required to neutral 
ize 30 ml of the 10 per cent solution with 
phenolphthalein as indicator Acid reacting 
tungstate may be used if the 10 per cent 
solution IS brought to neutrality or to very 
faint alkalinity with sodium hydroxide 

2 Sulfunc acid *3 normal (0 667 N) 
or 

3 Sulfunc acid normal (0 0833 
N) Dilute 2 0 or 2 5 ml of concentrated acid 
to 1 liter (always pour concentrated sul 
func acid into water never vice versa) 
Titrate with standardized 1 N or 0 1 N 
NaOH and adjust if necessary Stable

y/Add slowly with mixing (preferably by 
swirling in an Eilenmeyer flask or wide 
mouth bottle) 1 volume of % N H SO^ 

Insert a rubber stopper and give a few 
vigorous shakes A dark brown coagulum 
should form Should it fail to do so coagu 
lation IS incomplete ovvmg probably to use 
of too much oxalate In such cases add a 
few drops of 2 N (10 per cent) solution of 
sulfunc acid shake vigorously and allow 
the mixture to stand for five minutes for 
the coagulum to change from bnght red

B. Hadcn's Modification (1923) of Folin’s 
Metliod Iladcn simplified the previous 
method of making a protein free blood 
filtrate by combining the water and acid 
to make a twelfth normal solution of sul 
func acid The improved method consists 
of laking one volume of blood \\iih eight 
\olumes of twelfth normal solution of sul- 
func acid Add one xolume of 10 per cent 
solution of sodium tungstate, shake the 
mixture well and filter 

C. Van Slykc's Modification (1928) of 
Hadcn's Method Van Slyke further modi 
fied the Haden method for malting a pro 
tein free blood filtrate Mix one part of a 
10 per cent solution of sodium tungstate 
with eight parts of twelfth normal solution 
of sulfuric acid One part of oxalated blood 
IS added directly to nine parts of this mix 
ture This produces a clear, protein free 
filtrate without any laklng of the blood 
In this respect the method is similar to 
Folin’s modified method for protein pre- 
cipitation 

v/D Tolin's Modified Method (1930). Fohn 
published a modified method for rcmo img 
protein s from blood This method produces 
a watei-cleai solution with no laking of 
erythrocytes It is claimed for this extract 
that more accurate determinations can be 
made for blood sugar and uric acid and 
that urea determinations are identical with 
those obtained wth the older method It is 
of no advantage for serum or plasma

'^Deproteinization wtih^Zinc Hydroxide 

This method is used in the determination 
of blood glucose (p 418) In this modifica 
tion barium hydroxide is used in place of 
the alternative sodium hydroxide This has 
the advantage that the banum ion precipi 
tales the sulfate so that the precipitants 
are removed leaving no added ions in the 
filtrate

>/toMMENr It Is customary in many 
places to report urea in terms of Its nitro- 
gen content rather than in terms of urea 
itself This merely makes comparison with 
the total NPN easier Since ihe molecular 
weight of urea is CO of which the nitrogen 
In It Is 28 urea coneentntion is just over 
twice the urea nitrogen value 

After the heating penod and addition of 
persulfate there is competition Iwtwccn 
two reactions vvhJch cause Increase and 
decrease respectively In the color initnsitv 
Maximum intcnsitv for low concentrations 
of urea is reached sooner than for high 
ones and it would lie better to read those 
in the normal range at once anil only the 
high ones after 15 minutes For practical 
reasons it Is easier to read all samples 
standards as well as unknowns at 15 
minutes 

Dlacetvl monoximt is not stable even 
in tht solid form In unopened bottles A 
freshly made solution may therefore not 
be good Check each new batch with at

causes include increased protein catabolism 
of fever or cancer roentgen therapy of 
leukemia or Ijmphoma gastxointestmal 
hemorrhage or transfusions Urea nitrogen 
may nse as high as 400 mg per cent but 
usually does not exceed 200 mg per cent 
Determination of blood creatinine is fre 
quently helpful in deciding whether an 
increased BUN is renal in origin or not 
Urinary urea nitrogen is normallj about 
10 to 15 gm per 24 hours It reflects the 
dietary protein intake 

•/Orea Clearance (Moller et al, 1928) 
A small amount of kidney dysfunction 
may be present even with a normal BUN 
A more sensitive measure is obtained by 
relating the amount of urea excreted m 
the urine per mmute to the concentration 
in the blood This is done by the formula 
UV 

^ = where C is the clearance” in ml 

of blood per minute U and B are the urea 
(or urea mtrogen) concentrations in mg 
per cent in unne and blood respectively, 
V IS the volume of urme in milliliters and 
T the time m minutes of excretion that 
the unne represents The clearance is thus 
expressed as the volume of blood that will 
contam the amount of urea excreted in the 
unne m one minute 

It IS preferable to keep the urine flow 
above 2 ml per minute so that this formula 
for maximal clearance wall apply Van 
Slyke found that at smaller flows the test 
could be saliaged by using a modified 
formula for standard clearance 



The urea clearance test should be done 
only if the blood urea mtrogen concentra 
lion is below 20 mg per cent or if there 
is question as to whether a slightly in 
creased BUN is due to renal or prerenal 
causes 

Procedure The patient may have 
breakfast 

Have the patient dnnk a glassful of 
water 

Have the pauent void emptying the blad 
der completely and discarding tlie unne 
Note the time at the completion of voiding 
(The physician should be prepared to 
cathecerize if the patient cannot void or 
cannot empty the bladder completely ) 

Save all the unne voided during the test 
(the next two hours) 


An hour after the imual voidmg the pa 
tient should dnnk another glass of water 
and empty his bladder agam Save this urine 
with any voided dunng this first hour Note 
the time 

Now take a blood sample for urea de 
termination 

At the end of the second hour have the 
patient again empty his bladder com 
pletely Save this as a second specimen 
with any voided dunng the second hour 
Note the exact time 
blark each specimen with the time in 
terval in minutes that it represents This 
is important it is ummportant that the 
time be exactly an hour 

Analyze the blood and each unne sample 
tor urea Express all the results in the 
same terms (eg mg per cent) 

Calculate the urea clearance for each 
unne specimen using the maximal or 
standard clearance formula depending on 
the rate of urme flow If desired calculate 
the clearance as per cent of normal bj 
multiplying the clearance In ml of blood 
per minute by 100 and dividing by the 
normal value this latter is 75 for maximal 
and 54 for standard clearance 

The two urme samples are taken to 
check the accuracy of urme collection the

'Creatinine is usually determined by the 
red color produced by an alkaline picrate 
solution The reaction is not speciB** for 
creatinine The amount of other chromo 
gens in unne is small In normal whole 
blood perhaps half the color is due to 
creaunme but in serum or plasma it 
amounts to around 80 per cent (when the 
creatmine is elevated the percentage of 
other chromogens decreases) It is there 
fore preferable to do the determination on 
serum or plasma rather than on whole 
blood 

Reagents 

1 Sodium tungstate 10 per cent and 
sulfunc acid % N (See p 446 ) 

2 Picnc acid saturated Place 14 gm 
of picnc acid m a bottle and add 1 liter of 
water Let stand a day with occasional 
shaking before use Let settle and decant or 
siphon off with care to avoid getting any 
sohd particles 

Most reagent grade picnc acid (which 
contains 10 to 20 per cent of water to re 
duce the hazard of explosion) is satisfac 
tory The solution should be checked the 
first time a new batch is used the ab 
sorbance of the alkaline picrate should not 
be over twice that of the picric acid 

3 Sodium hydroxide 10 per cent Most 
comeniently prepared by diluuon of con 
centrated NaOH (p 399) (10 per cent = 

2 5 N) Keep in a borosillcate glass or pref

and add 0 8 ml of concentrated HCl When 
all the creatmine is dissolved dilute to 100

For urme calculate as for blood then 
multiply by 25 or 10 (since blood was 
diluted 4 or 10 fold and unne 100 fold) 
Now multiply by the number of hundreds

Intzbpretation Normal v alues for 
serum or plasma creatmine are in the range 
of 0 5 to 1 2 mg per cent Significance of 
changes is much the same as for urea ex 
cept that the prerenal factors have little 
effect Ordinarily urea values are of more 
importance when normal or slightly in 
creased creatinine values are more im 
portant when increases are more marked 

Creatinine Clearance Tests 
This can be done the same as for the 
urea clearance (p 449) except that water 
need not be forced to maintain a high unne 
flow Calculation is by the “maximal 
clearance formula and is expressed as ml 
per min per 1 73 sq m rather than as per 
cent of normal Normal values are 80 to 
110 ml per min per 1 73 sq m Creatimne 
clearance is a good measure of glomenilar 
filtration when serum creatimne concen 
tration is in the normal range At higher 
concentrations some creatimne is excreted 
by the tubules as well

Uric Acid (Cara wav 1055 
Henry ct of 1957) 

In alkaline solution unc acid reduces i 
complex phosphotungstate with the produc 
uon of a blue color 

Reagents 

1 Fhosphotungsuc aud Dissolve 30 
gm of sodium tungstate (reagent grade) in 
300 ml of distilled water in a flask with a 
ground glass joint Add 32 ml of 85 per 
cent o-phosphoric acid and several car 
borundum grains (No 12) Attach a re 
flux condenser and boil gently for two 
hours Cool to room temperature and add 
water to a total volume of 1 liter Add 16 gm 
of LiSOjHO and dissolve Tlic reagent 
IS stable in a refngcrator 

This reagent is merely a 2 5-fold dilu 
tion of the reagent described by Folin and 
Denis (1914) with lithium sulfate added 
The inclusion of lithium sulfate was sug 
gested by the early observation of Folin 
that the presence of lithium salts tends to 
suppress the formation of turbidity in the 
reaction 

2 Sodium carbonate 14 per cent Dis 
solve 14 gm of anhydrous sodium car 
bonate in water and dilute to 100 ml Store 
m a polyethylene bottle Stable 

3 Uric acid stock standard Add 100 
mg of uric acid and 60 mg of LI COj to 
approximately 50 ml of uaier Jn a 100 ml 
voUimctric flask Warm to approximately

cool to room temperature, and add water to 
100 ml The reagent is stable m a refng- 
erator 1 ml = 1 mg 

4 Unc acid working standard Dilute 
I ml of stock to 100 ml ivith water Mix 
well Prepare fresh daily 1 ml = 0 01 mg , 

1 mg per cent used as filtrate equivalent 
to 10 mg per cent 

Procedure For serum (oralated 
plasma or whole blood should not be used) 
prepare a protein free filtrate (see p 446) 

For unne if the specimen is cloudy, 
warm sample to 60° C for ten minutes to 
ensure dissolimg of an> urates and then 
centnfuge Dilute 1 \olume accurately to 
100 \olumes wth water 

Pipet 3 ml of filtrate or dilution into a 
test tube or cmet 

Pipet 3 ml of water into another tube 
for a blank 

Pipet 3 ml of working standard Into a 
third tube 

To each tube add 1 ml of 14 per cent 
sodium carbonate Mix 

Add 1 ml dilute phosphotungstic aad 
Mix at once 

Let stand 15 minutes at room ,tcm- 
perature 

Read within the next 30 minutes with 
red No 66 filter or at 710 m^i set to 
zero inth blank (which should be colorless) 
or set to zero mth water and subrracung 
blank from each unknown 

Calculation For serum calculate 
mg per cent unc acid from factor, graph 
or cur\e as established by Standardization 

For unne calculate as for serum and 
then multiply by 10 (since scrum was 
diluted 10-fold and unne 100 fold) Now 
muUiplv b) the number of hundreds of 
ml in the specimen to ohtam the mg of 
unc acid in the specimen If this numlwr is 
large It mav be dwided b> 1000 and re- 
ported as grams 

Standardization Make up a 2 mg

Plot readings against equnalent scrum 
concentration If a straight line is obtained 
a factor may be calculated and used In am 
case the curYe or a table made up from it 
can be used for calculation 
The standardizauon should be checked 
by runmng a 10 mg per cent equhalent 
standard along ivith unknowns as deenbed 
in Procedure 

Interpretation' Normal lalues for 
serum unc acid are 3 to 5 5 mg per cent 
Increases are found in gout in familial 
hyperuricemia in kidney disease, in toxe 
mia of pregnancy, and in leukemia and 
other diseases imolnng breakdown of 
nuclear matenal 

Normal unc acid excretion is around 
0 7 gm per day

8 Petrolatum white or Ucon lubn 
cant 75 11 90 000 Carbide and Carbon 
Chemicals Company 

Collection of Specimen Ammo- 
nium oxalate must of course not be used 
Prepare 50 ml Erlenmeyer flasks by adding 

2 drops of 20 per cent potassium oxalate 
and drying it a moderate temperature Just 
before use flush the flask out with pure CO.> 
(not 5 pet cent) and stopper (Histo- 
pathology or microbiology department may 
have a cylinder of CO ) Draw 5 ml of 
blood rapidly transfer to the flask and 
quickly restopper Mlx to dissolve the 
oxalate 

Pboceduhe The determmation should 
start 20 minutes after collection of the 
blood This usually means setting op the 
dishes before gomg for the blood 

Prepare the Conway dishes by lightly 
greasing the top of the inner ring and pjac 
ing a ring of petrolatum on the glass plat6 
where it will fit the outer nm It may help 
^also to place two lines of petrolatum across 
the bottom of the outer chamber (at 6 and 
12 o clock) to prevent the carbonate and 
blood from mixing prematurely Prepare 
four dishes for blanks and standards as well 
as two for each blood sample being 
analyzed 

Pipet approximately 1 ml of bone acid 
solution into the mner well Rinse by re- 
moving with a pipet medicine dropper or 
disposable Pasteur pipet and rubber bulb 
Pipet a fresh 1 ml into the well Add one 
drop of indicator solution holding the 
dropper vertical so that all drops will be 
the same size In all dishes the solution 
should now have the same color If not 


continue rinsing that dish until no color 
change occurs 

Pipet 1 ml of saturated potassium car 
bonate solution into one side of the outer 
well of each dish Cover two dishes and set 
aside as blanks 

Pipet I ml of blood or standard in dupli 
cate into the other side of the outer well 
of the remaining dishes (four dishes if one 
blood sample is being analyzed) (Blood 
should be pipetted 20 minutes after col 
lection ) 

Cover immediately with the greased 
glass 

After the cover Is securely in place care 
fully rotate the dish to mix alkah and blood 
without mixing the inner and outer wells 
Mark the time of mixing and the type of 
sample on the cover 

Let stand at room temperature for 20 
mmutes 

Before the time is up fill the micro 
buret with fresh 0 003 N HCl 

At the end of the 20 mmutes titrate each 
center well (Practice first until you can 
recognize the endpoint set up a few stand 
ards and run them before trying a blood ) 
Record the amount of HCl to titrate ?ach 
dish 

Calculation Subtract the average 
blank from each standard and unknown 
ml HCl X HCl factor x 4200 = meg per 
cent NHs N (ammonia nitrogen) (If the 
HCl is exactly 0 003 N factor = 1 ) The 
standard should come out 200 mg per cent 

Interpretation Normal ammonia 
nitrogen by this procedure is 20 to 120 meg 
of ammonia nitrogen per 100 ml of blood 
It may be elevated in severe liver disease 

Exercise Figure out why the multi 
pher in the calculation is 4200

Water and 


Electrolytes 


By HARRY P WOSBERG, M 1) 


Describing electrolyte concentrations in 
the blood and other bod> tissues In terms of 
milligrams per 100 ml is not adequate for 
the proper understanding of the balance of 
the posltuely charged and negatucly 
charged electrolytes present in the body 
Substances do not react ^aih each other 
gram for gram or milligram for milligram 
but do react in proportion to their equiva 
lent weights The chemical dciiniiion of an 
cqmiaknt tiefghl of a substance is that 
ttcight uhtch tsill displace or othcia^isc 
react with 1 008 gm (1 gram atomic 
weight) of hydrogen or combine with 8 00 
gm gram atomic weight) of oxygen 
Since the concentrations of the \anous 
electrolytes in the body arc extremely small, 
they arc expressed in terms of miUicquha 
Icnis a milliequlialcnt Is 1/1000 of an 
equivalent weight When the various elcc 
trolytcs arc expressed in terms of mllll 
equivalents per liter one can see a balance 
that cannot be seen when values arc cx 
pressed in milligrams per 100 ml Tills Is 
seen In Table 9-1 which compares repre 
seniativc concentrations of scrum or 
plasma electrolytes expressed as milligrams 
per 100 ml and as mlllicquivaicnts per 
liter 

Electrolytes arc usually determined In 
scrum or plasma rather than in whole 
blood since there Is an unequal distribu 
tlon of electrolytes between the serum com 
ponent of the blood and the red blood cells 
Any anemia or change in hematocrit read 
Ing vvlll cause an alteration when tlic 
electrolytes in whole blood arc determined 
whereas the dttermination of the electrolyte 
in serum or plasma will remain constant 

•156 


no matter what the actual red blootl cell 
count 

Table 0-2 lists the various electrolytes in 
normal scrum or plasma and the various 
data necessary to convert nilllignms per 
100 ml to millJcquivalents per liter. In ad 
ditjon the normal ranges aa expressed in 
botli forms in the tabic 

An anioii is .a negatively charged Ion that 
migrates to the positivciv charged dec 
trodc (anode) when an electric curn.nl Is

A cfllton IS a positively charged ion that 
migrates to the negatively charged electrode 
(cathode) when the electric current is 
passed through a solution of sodium chlo 
nde Sodium chloride in ivater will dis 
sociatc into sodium and chlonde ions, and 
these ions— anions and cations — ate inter* 
mingled in the solution 

The correct definition of an uetd, both for 
the chemistry laboratory and for biology 
and medicine, js that substance which is 
able to give a proton (the proton donor of 
Brpnsted) A base is a substance capable of 
accepting a proton (proton acceptor) to 
form an acid The proton is the hydrogen 
ion, H+, or the hydrated hydrogen ion, 
H 3 O+, called the hydronlum ion Thus, the 
cations, sodium, potassium calcium, and 
magnesium, have positive charges and are 
neither base nor acid However, the anions 
are 'bases” m the sense that they can com- 
bine ivith a hydrogen ion (proton) to form 
an acid according to the concept of Br 0 n 
sted In describing the positively and neg 
auvely charged ions of blood we can best 
speak of them as cations and anions How- 
ever, as will be seen later, when discussing 
acid base balance, the terms acid and base 
can be used, provided there is an under 
standing of the Bronsted system of proton 
donors and proton acceptors 


CATIONS 

Sodium 

Dietary sodium is usually obtained as 
sodium chlonde ihe amount ingested vary 
ing according to the taste of the individual 
Because of this the exact minimal daily 
requirement of sodium for man is not 
known In the adult approximately 40 to 
90 mEq of sodium are excreted per liter 
of urme or an average of approximately 
110 mCq per 24 hours In a young child 
the daily requirement for sodium is approxi 
mately 50 mEq per day, and in infants 
of about one year the requirement is ap 
proximately 17 mEq per day 

The daily exchange of sodium is about 
the same for infants and adults the daily 
exchange for the adult is about 3 to 6 per 
cent of the total sodium contained in the 
body and about 4 per cent for a child This 
exchange of sodium is brought about by 
the Ingestion via the gastrointestinal tract 
and the loss via urinary excretion Sodium 
is also lost via the sweat In a fasting indi 
vidual without any sodium intake the unn 
ary loss of sodium will occur for the first 
two days and then drop 10 minimal values, 
provad^ no abnormal losses of water occur 
When sodium is lost from the body, there 





458 CUMCAt DtACNOSIS 

is also a loss of extracellular water to main 
tain a normal osmotic equilibnum 

Various formulas ha\e been devased to 
compute the sodium concentration in serum 
from the chloride and bicarbonate concen 
trations Such formulas do not appl> if 
there is any abnormal alteration of bicar 
bonate they are worthless especially with 
the introduction of flame spectrophotome 
tr> by which sodium determinations can be 
done \er> easily 

Contrary to the former belief that sodium 
IS always extracellular and not found vnih 
m the cells it has been shown that sodium 
IS present within the cells the amount de 
pending upon conditions existing in the 
extracellular compartment Energy produc 
ing reactions are believed to be necessary 
for the transfer of the sodium ion across 
the Cell membrane The amount of mtra 
cellular sodium is 10 to 35 mEq per liter 
of cell water Normal intracellular sodium 
is reported to be equal to about one sixth 
to one nmth of the total extracellular 
sodium or to about one half to almost the 
entire amount of extracellular bicarbonate 
In the adult there is about 1 09 gm of 
sodium per kilogram (fat free) and in the 
newborn the sodium content is 1 78 gm 
per kilogram The average man contains 
about 65 gm of sodium in his body about 
38 gm arc extracellular 21 gm are in the 
bones and about 6 gm are found wnhm 
the cells The intracellular sodium acts as 
an additional buffer protecting the pH of 
the extracellular fluid 

Undoubtedly the quickest method of de 
termining sodium concentrations is with a 
flame photometer The sodium of the blood 
Is almost entirely In the plasma or servm 
fraction The normal range for serum 
sodium is 136 to 150 mEq per liter or 
approximatel) 310 to 345 mg per 100 ml 
The range of whole blood sodium is about 
75 to 100 mEq per liter or 170 to 225 mg 
per 100 ml

same way as the unknown When carry- 
ing out tests of unknowns, prepare a check 
standard solution using 0 1 ml of the 150 
mEq per liter standard sodium solution 

Method of Talsott and King (1952) 
This bedside screening procedure is in 
tended primarily for unne but can also 
be used for serum and other biologic fluids 
Principle The test is based upon the 
standard procedure of chemical analysis 
with uranyl acetate 

Reagents 

a In a weighed 1 L beaker place 40 
gm of reagent grade uranyl acetate, 
24 gm of 30 per cent acetic acid, 
and enough water to make a total 
weight of 260 gm contained in the 
beaker 

h A similar beaker is filled to the 
same weight of 260 gm by adding 
110 gm of zinc acetate, 12 gm of 
30 per cent acetic acid, and distilled 
water to make up the rest 
Both beakers are heated separately on a 
steam bath and are covered with watch 
glasses to prevent evaporation, the con 
tents are stirred frequently. Heating is 
continued for two to three hours until the 
solution Is nearly complete The hot liquids 
are then placed in a 1 L beaker, cooled, 
placed in a dark bottle, and Altered before 
use 

Technique 

1 In a small, clean test tube place 
1 drop of the sample to be tested Rinse 
dropper well with distilled water before 
reusing 

2 Using the same dropper, add 8 
drops of the reagent and mix gently 

3 Read in eight minutes 

4 Classify the test as negative 
through 5+, depending upon the rapidity 
of fall of the particles, the amount, size, 
and density of the particles, the amount 
of precipitate rimming the tube above the 
fluid line, and the heaviness of the pre 
cipitate or white-colored solution 

5 Standards should be made using 
sodium chlonde to correspond to the ranges 
of 1+ through 5+ A 1+ is a range of 0 
to 45 mEq , 2-*- equals 45 to 90, 3+ equals 
90 to 149, 4+ equals 149 to 267, and 5+ 
equals 267 to over 445 mEq 

Comments False readings may result 
when unne is tested for the sodium con- 
tent Solutions may become turbid after the 
reaction owing to a soft, cloudy filtrate 
apparently composed of acid urates The 


test should be repeated with a drop of unne 
that has been heated and the reagent added 
pnor to cooling 

If albuminuria prevents accurate inter- 
pretation of the test, the unne should be 
mixed with sulfosabcyhc acid and filtered 
before use in the test 

Complete reaction requires from six to 
ten minutes, and therefore the sodium con 
centrauon is read at eight minutes For a 
screenmg test, however, it may be suffi 
cienC to read at three or four minutes 
especially when comparing wth standard 
sodium chloride solutions as controls 

Potassium 

On a normal average diet there is no 
deficiency of potassium, since this element 
is found In practically all foodstuffs The 
adult takes m about 60 mEq of potassium 
per 24 hours, the exact mimmal daily re 
quircment of potassium for man is not 
known Normally about 80 to 90 per cent 
of the potassium is excreted in the unne, 
the remainder is excreted in the feces and 
to a small extent in the sweat In contrast 
to a fasting adult in whom sodium excre 
tion will soon decrease the excretion of 
potassium continues while the adult is 
fasting or on a diet adequate In calones 
but potassium free About 40 to 50 mEq 
of potassium are lost per day in the urine 
this daily loss is more important in chil 
dren The daily exchange of potassium in 
the adult is 1 to 2 per cent of the total 
body potassium content, whereas in a one 
year-old child the exchange is 14 per cent 
of the total body potassium 

Potassium is the major cation found in 
side cells The body content of potassium 
in ihe adult is 2 65 gm per kilogram (fat 
free) and 1 90 gm per kilogram in the 
neivbom 

The normal range of potassium concen 
tration in the serum or plasma is 4 0 to 
5 6 mEq per liter or about 16 to 22 mg 
per 100 ml Most of the potassium in the 
blood is contained in the red blood cells 
and since this can vary wth hematocrit it 
is preferable to determine serum or plasma 
potassium levels Whole blood potassium 
ranges from about 38 to 64 mEq per liter 
or 150 to 250 mg per 100 ml Since the 
red blood cells contain so much more potas 
Slum than does the serum, it is essential to 
avoid hemolysis in obtaining the specimen 
diffusion of potassium out of the red cells 
should te avoided by determining the po- 
tassium as soon as possible

H O After suitable %%ashing the amount 
of cobalt in the precipitate is determined 
colorimetncally using the green color pro- 
duced after the addition of cholme chloride 
by the action of sodium ferrocyanide A 
standard potassium solution may be treated 
similarly or a cobalt solution already

standardized the cobalt solution 
keeps well 

Technique 

1 Piper 1 ml of serum into a cen 
infuge tube graduated at 6 ml 

2 Add 3 ml of the cobaltmitnte 
reagent from a pipet by blowmg 
out rapidly to aid mixing Imme 
diately complete mixmg by rotat 
mg the tube between the palms 
of the hands (A sUrnng rod 
should not be used ) 

3 The mLxture is allovved to stand 
for two hours at a temperature 
of 15® C or above 

4 Centrifuge for ten minutes at a 
moderate speed 

5 Remove the supernatant fluid by 
invertmg the tube and allowing 
it to dram on a filter paper for 
a short time 

6 Wipe the mouth of the tube and 
add 5 ml of 35 per cent aqueous 
ethyl alcohol washing down the 
sides of the tube 

7 Mix the precipitate with a glass

Water and ELEcreoL'i'TEs 


13 Dilute to the 6 ml mark with dis 
tilled water and mix well 

14 A cobalt standard should be 
treated in the same way, diluting 
2 ml of the cobalt standard to 
6 ml as in step 13 

15 If necessary, centrifuge to remove 
the shght cloudiness caused by the 
small amount of protein present 

16 The color will fade slowly and 
so should be measured within 30 
minutes at a wave length of 600 
millirmcrons using a reagent 
blank set at 100 per cent trans 
mission 

17 Standard potassium solutions con 
taming 15 20 25 and 30 mg of 
potassium per 100 ml treated in 
the same way as serum will give 
a standard cune covering the 
values of serum potassium usually 
found 

Comments The modification of Barry 
and Rowland (1953) has eliminated many 
of the inaccuracies of the original Kramer 
and Tisdall (1921) method These were 
dilution of the serum with water insuffi 
cient time for the precipitation and solu 
tion of some of the precipitate during wash 
mg In addition the possibility of incom 
plete precipitation owing to the solubility 
of potassium sodium cobaJtinitnte in the 
precipitatmg reagent has been overcome 
by saturating the latter with this substance 
Rapid addition of the cobaltinitnte reagent 
is used instead of dropwise addition to in 
sure the same sodium potassium ratio be 
fore precipitation begins If the tempera 
ture of precipitation of serum is withm 
3® C of tlie temperature at whlcli the 
standard curve was prepared the curve 
may be used repeatedly However it js a 
wise precauUon to run a standard with 
each set of determinations 

The centrifuge tubes must be cleaned 
to be sure that all traces of potassium 
ferrocyanide are removed they should be 
left in cleaning solution made of chromate 
in sulfuric acid rinsed thoroughly in water 
heated for one half hour in boibng distilled 
water, and finally rinsed again in distilled 
water 

Ammonium salts interfere since am 
momum cobaltimtrlte is also very insoluble 
Therefore any contamination with am 
momum salts should be avoided and the 
estimation should be done on fresh serum 
and not on serum that may have stood for 
some time and become contaminated with 
bacteria

Technique 

Special equipment needed for this pro 
cedure is Sahli hemoglobin pjpets call 
brated at 0 01 and 0 02 ml micro

one of the culture slides 

2 Transfer 0 02 ml of each of the 
3 mEq per bter and 5 mEq per liter 
standard potassium solutions to the depres 
sions of the second slide 

3 Add 0 Dl m3 of the sodium cobahi 
nitrite reagent to each of the specimens in 
the following order (1) to an unknown 
(2) to the 3 mEq per hter standard (3) 
to the 5 mEq per hter standard and (4) 
to the duplicate unknown 

4 Each sample is then mixed thor 
oughly for five seconds with a rubber tip 
stirring rod using a rapid circular motion 
the rod being wiped dry between stirrings 
Note Rapid complete mixing of ihe solu 
tions IS essential to insure an even distd 
buiJon of the precipitate 

5 Place the test slide on a glossy black 
X ray film and compare the intensity of the 
precipltite formed by the standard solu 
tions with the unknowns The precipitate 
is best seen when light is directed across 
the slide 

Cnnimcnis The 5 mEq per liter standard 
potassium solution develops a diffuse whit 
ish yellow, cloudy precipitate vvuthin 10 
seconds, but the 3 mEq per liter standard 
solution remains clear for about 20 seconds 
and then slowly develops a faint white 
precipitate around the periphery At low 
temperatures the sodium potassium cobalt

imtnte precipitate forms sooner and is 
more pronounced than it is at higher tem 
peratures The temperatures of the stand 
ard and the unknowns must be the same 
The readings can often be completed within 
30 seconds and must be made within about 
five minutes Classification of the un 
knowns is made as follows (1) if the 
precipitate contains less than that found 
in the 3 mEq per hter standard, (2) if the 
precipitate is about the same as the 3 
mEq per liter standard, (3) if the precipi 
tate IS an amount intermediate between the 
3 mEq per liter and 5 mEq per hter stand 
ards (4) if the precipitate is about the 
same as the 5 mEq per hter standard, and 
(5) if the precipitate is greater than the 
5 mEq per hter standard 

Grossly hpemic serum cannot be used 
unless It is cleared by shaking 4 parts of 
ethyl ether with 1 part of serum for one 
minute and centnfugmg The supernatant 
ether and fatty plasma layer are removed, 
and the remaimng plasma is then used 
for the potassium deiermmation Both 
standard potassium solutions should be run 
each tune a test is done, if a distinct difier* 
ence is not present either a fresh lot of 
the cobaltinitnte reagent should be made 
or the standards checked Do not read the 
unknown if either it or the standards con 
tarn a localized preapitation of the cobalu 
nitnte salt The test slides should be kept 
scrupulous!) clean and free of abrasions so 
that the fine sodium potassium coballmi 
tnte precipitate is evenly distributed and 
can be clearly identified Contanunation 
of serum with red or white cells will give a 
falsely high value \Vhen doing a determin

should be diluted 1 20 

Calcium 

The requirement for calcium vanes from 
individual to individual and even in the 
same mdmdual at vanous tunes Factors 
that regulate the absorption and retention 
of calcium m normal individuals are nor 
mal gastnc aadity to allow for the absorp 
tion of soluble calcium salts adequate 
supply of vitamin D to aid m absorption 
of calcium normal fat digestion, a proper 
ratio of calcium and phosphorus in the 
diet, and a large enough intake to allow 
for precipitation of msoluble calaum salts 
in the mtestine 

The urinary excretion of calcium ac 
counts for 20 per cent of the calcium ex 
creted and is influenced by the calaam 


intake, skeletal size, kidney regulation of 
anions and cations, and vanous endocrine 
factors Approximately 80 per cent of the 
calcium excreted is via the feces as m 
soluble salts An adult will be m calcium 
equilibnum when the intake is 10 mg per 
kilogram of body weight An ample intake 
of calcium for an adult will be provided by 
two to three glasses of milk per day Cal 
cium is never absorbed completely from the 
gastrointestinal tract, calcium is also 
present in the gastrointestinal juices se- 
creted into the gut These juices contain 
5 to 10 mg of calcium per 100 ml and 
therefore serve as an important factor in 
the reabsorption of calcium and in the ad 
jusiment of cell permeability About 99 per 
cent of the body calcium is situated m the 
bones and teeth the remainder is presum 
ably present in the extracellular fluid and 
not within the cells It is very probable, 
however, that small amounts of calaum 
are present withm tissue cells outside the 
skeletal system The body content of cal* 
aum in the adult is 20 I gm per kilogram 
(fat free) and 9 2 gm per kilogram in the 
newborn 

Recently several methods have been 
described, utilizing flame photometry to 
determine the calcium concentration in the 
blood Some instruments require organic 
solvents to intensify the calcium emission 
hne, other mstruments, such as the Cole 
man flame photometer, have been utilized 
to determme calcium durecUy. using a 
rather low temperature flame All the cal 
aum in the blood is present in the plasma 
The normal range for total serum or plasma 
calcium IS between 9 and 11 mg per 100 
ml or 4 5 to 5 5 mEq per liter In infants 
especially prematures, with adequate m 
take of vitamin D the serum level of cal 
aum may be as high as 12 to 13 mg per 
100 ml The calcium present in serum is 
found in three major fractions a portion 
bound to protein, a portion that is lomzed 
and an un lomzed, diffusible complex of cal 
cium citrate This aspect of calcium me- 
tabolism IS discussed further under ionized 
calcium

Ionized Calcium 

It has been assumed that about one half 
the total calcium of the serum is bound to 
protein and is therefore physiologically m 
active The remaining half is composed 
primarily of ionized calcium and an un ion 
ized citrate complex Only the ionized 
calcium IS involved in the control of 
muscle irritability McLean and Hastings 
(1935) were able to determine the lomzed 
calcium utilizing a biologic assay tech 
nique They reported the range of normal 
lomzed calcium as 4 25 to 5 25 mg per 
100 ml or 2 1 to 2 6 mEq per liter They 
have constructed a nomogram from which 
the amount of ionized calcium present can 
be determined if the total calcium and the 
total protem are known Previously Green 
Wald (1931) had proposed a formula m 
which 0 87 mg of calcium was considered 
to be bound to each gram of protem present 
Thus the ionized calcium was equal to the 
total calcium minus (0 87 X total protem 
expressed as grams per 100 ml ) 

More recently Nordin and Fraser (1956) 
have reported that only about one third of 
the calcium is bound to protein rather than 
one half Their formula for the portion 
bound to protem is protem bound calcium 
equals (7 6 X albumin) plus (2 9 x globu 
lin) minus 3 1 Thus the protein bound 
calcium is expressed as per cent of total 
calcium and the albumin and globulin are 
expressed as grams per 100 ml of serum 
For example if a serum contains 10 8 mg 
of total c^cium per 100 ml 4 6 gm per 
cent of albumin and 2 1 gm per cent of 
globuLn then the protem bound calcium is 
equal to (76 X 4 6) + (2 9 X 2 1) - 3 1 
or 38 pet cent Therefore 10 8 times 0 38 
equals 4 1 mg of calcium as protein bound 
calcium per 100 ml of serum and 6 7 mg 
of diffusible calcium per 100 ml of serum 

Because of the difficulty in usmg the 
McLean and Hastings nomogram Zeisler 
(1954) devised a simple formula which 
in normal ranges of total calcium and total 
protein expresses very well the concentra 
non of ionized calcium The formula is 
6 Ca-^ 

Ca++ = -p i*' which the total ciki 

um is expressed as milligrams per 100 ml 
and total protein as grams per 100 ml

The ionized calcium ^^hlch is obtained 
from the formula is also expressed as miUi 
grams per 100 ml Rose (1957) has dc 
scribed the determination of ionized and 
uUrafiherable calcium of normal human 
serum utilizing a chemical method TTiis 
technique depends upon the ultrafiliration 
of plasma followed by the determination of 
ionized and total calcium in the ultrafil 
trate In order to obtain an ultrafiltrate of 
plasma the carbon dioxide tension of the 
plasma must be kept constant and at the 
same tension as in the body fluid from 
which it came It is necessary to assume 
that the act of ultrafiltration docs not in 
Itself alter the ionized calcium of the 
plasma The actual values obtained by Rose 
for the total calcium in the ultrafiltrate are 
6 05 to 6 35 mg per 100 ml These are 
higher than would be expected from the 
results of McLean and Hastings who found 
Ionized calcium of plasma to be 4 25 to 
5 25 mg per 100 ml The nontomzed ultra 
filterable calcium (possibly a citrate com 
plex) was 0 15 to 0 51 mg per 100 ml 
this agrees tery well tvith the value of 
McLean and Hastings who reported the 
nonionized ultrafiltcrablc calcium to be less 
than 0 6 mg per 100 ml 
Torlbara and cenworkers (1957) have 
described a simple uUrafUtratlon apparatus 
which can be obtained from the Will Cor 
poration Rochester New York The use of 
a large laboratory centrifuge Is required Jn 
order to obtain the proper pressure for 
uUrafUtratlon They report that at phjsio- 
logic pH and temperature 60 to 70 percent 
of the total scrum calcium is found to be 
ultrafiUcnble This correlates very well with 
the '‘bwlogicaHy active" caJcivm described 
b> Yendt ct al (1955) McLean and Hast 
ings utilizing the frog heart method re 
ported “ionic calcium” to be about 52 per 
cent of the total calcium Toribara ct nl 
have calculated the normal scrum con 
centration of the complexes of calcium as 
citrate phosphate and bicarbonate to be 
12 per cent of the total calcium When ibis 
is added to the 52 per cent of the ionized 
calcium of McLean and Hastings the value 
G4 per cent Is again very close to the ultra 
filterable calcium

Laboratory Mmtons

Approximately 60 per cent of the dietary 
magnesium is excreted \1a the feces and 
40 per cent via the unne It is probable that 
the same factors that control calcium ab-

in the adult is 0 36 gm per kilogram (fat 
free) and 0 27 gm per kilogram in the 
newborn Magnesium also governs neuro- 
muscular irritability and is important for 
the coenzymes in the metabolism of carbo- 
hydrates and proteins 

Magnesium has also been analyzed by 
flame photometry but requires much more 
specialized apparatus because of the low

Total Base (Total Cations) 

The determination of total “base" is not 
done routinely especially since the advent 
of the flame photometer, which allows for 
the direct determination of sodium and 
potassium and also for dctermiiung calcium 
and magnesium values of serum 

Sunderman (1945) has described an 
electrometnc method for determination of 
total base in which the serum conductivity 
is determined with a conductivity appa 
ratus and reqiures the chemical determma 
tion of the total serum protems If the total 
proteins are assumed to be 6 36 gm for 
a normal range of 6 0 to 6 9 gm per 100 
ml , an error of 1 per cent will result A 
nomogram has also been formulated to 
avoid calculations thus, the conductivity 
value with or without the protein concen 
tration is used to determine the total base 
The normal values reported by Sunderman 
for total base were 142 to 149 mEq per 
liter, which varied by 1 5 per cent from the 
chemical analyses for each of the cations, 
sodium potassium, calcium and mag 
nesium Since the sodium value was ap 
proximately 135 mEq per liter and the 
potassium calcium and magnesium ap- 
proximately 11, Sunderman reported a 
method for determimng serum sodium by 
assummg a factor of II for the other ca 
tions, thus sodium equals total base minus 
11 

Boesen and Loud (1956) have described 
a conductnmetnc screening test for the 
total electrolytes, both amons and cations

Clinical Diagnosis b> Laboratory Methods 


A bedside determination of total cations is 
described by Scnbner and Wiegert (1954), 
utilizing synthetic exchange resins Serum 
IS put through a column contaimng a ca 
tion exchange resin that almost completely 
remoies sodium potassium calcium and 
magnesium A chemically equiialent 
amount of hjdrogen is released part of 
the hvdrogen reacts with the bicarbonate 
in the serum to form carbonic acid which 
escapes The amount of hidrogcn ion that 
has reacted with the serum bicarbonate can 
be determined on a separate sample, and 
the remainder of the hjdrogen ion released 
from the exchange column is determined 
by titratmg to a pH of 7 4 with standard 
sodium hydroxide The amount of base or 
cation used m this titration and the \alue 
of the serum bicarbonate reflect the total 
amount of hydrogen ion released which in 
turn equals the concentration of total ca 
tions in the serum

The exact requirement of chloride for 
the adult is not knoivn The unnarj ex 
cretion of chloride suggests that most re 
ported chloride requirements are too high 
In the adult the daily exchange of chloride 
IS about 2 to 7 pec cent of the total body 
chloride and in the child the daily turn 
o\er of chlonde is about 4 per cent of the 
body content of chlonde Chlonde losses 
usually follow those of sodium howe\er. 
the proportions will differ since the loss of 
chlonde can be compensated for bj an in 
crease of the serum bicarbonate Such 
compensatory changes do not occur when 
sodium is lost and therefore requires the 
loss of body water Chlonde losses will 
produce the same effects in intracellular 
and extracellular compartments as are seen 
mth the loss of potassium A deficiency of 
either chlonde or potassium tviU lead to a 
defiat of the other 

Chlonde plays an integral role in the 
buffenng action when oxygen and carbon 
dioxide exchange m the erythrocytes the 
“chlonde shift " \Vhen blood is oxygenated, 
chloride traiels from the red blood cells to 
the plasma while bicarbonate leates the 
plasma and enters the red blood cells This 
shift in the ratio of cell chlonde to plasma 
chlonde also occurs when the blood be- 
comes more alkaline thus, \enous blood 
inll have a lower plasma chlonde concen 
tration in comparison to the oxygenated 
artenal blood Water traiels in the same 


direction as chlonde, the erythrocytes be 
come dehydrated when blood is oxygen 
ated Normal serum or plasma chlonde 
concentrauon is 98 to 106 mEq per hter 
B> contrast the amount of chlonde found 
wthm the cells may range up to about 25 
mEq per liter of cell water TTie body con 
tent of chlonde in the adult is 1 56 gm 
per kilogram (fat free) and 2 0 gm per 
kilogram in the newborn 

Method of Schales and Schales (1941) 
Principle Chlonde combines with mer 
cunc ions to form unionized mercunc 
chlonde Even though no precipitate is 
formed, the nondissoaated mercunc 
chlonde is just as effecme m removing the 
chlonde from the solution The end point 
IS recognized by the appearance of mercunc 
ions in solution this recognition of mer 
cunc ions is made possible by \anous indi 
cators such as urea and sodium mtro- 
prusside In the Schales and Schales method 
use is made of s-diphenylcarbazone which 
changes from colorless or light yellow to 
an intense blue when combined inth mer 
cunc ions It is essential that the pH at 
the end point be between 1 and 2 (Asper et 
at, 1947)

Technique 

1 To a 25 ml Erlenmeyer flask add 

2 ml of disulled i\ater 

2 Using a “to contain” pipet add 0 20 
ml of serum rinsing several times 

3 Add 0 06 ml (4 drops) of the 
diphenylcarbazone indicator The color is 
salmon red m a slightly turbid mixture 

4 Using a microburct calibrated m 
0 01 to 0 05 ml titrate with the mercuric 
nitrate solution The color chmges will be 
to a deep violet and then a light yellow 
and the end point will be a nolet color 
which can be seen quite readily 

Calculations Milliequivalents of chloride 
per liter in serum (or spinal fluid done the 
same way) is equal to the titration of the 
unknown limes factor F 

Comments Titration of plasma or serum 
involves a change of colors in the end point 
color at first is salmon red changing to 
deep violet when the titration has begun 
and then becoming pale yellow or colorless 
Tie end point is denoted by s sharp change 
to a pale violet color If the test is done on 
a protein free filtrate an intense violet 
blue color is seen when the first drop of 
excess mercuric nitrate solution is added 
The protein present in the serum does affect 
the titration and the results u’lJJ be 1 to 

3 mEq higher than when done on a filtrate 
of whole blood or of plasma or serum 

A method for unne or spmal fluid uses

by Aspet et at (1947) Kirman et al 
(1958) have modified the Schales and 
Schales technique to eliminate the personal 
error in reading the end pomt b) using the 
Beckman automatic titrator 

Scribner (1950) has described a bedside 
determination of chloride based upon the 
method of Schales and Schales Another 
method of calculating without using the 
filtration factor would be to consider T, as 
the millihters of mercuric nitrate required 
for the titration of 2 ml of the standard 
solution (which would be equal to 0 02 


Method of Van Slyke and Hiller (1947) 

Principle Phosphotungstic acid is added 
to serum or plasma to precipitate the pro- 
teins The mixture is then shaken with an 
excess of solid silver lodate and filtered The 
msoluble silver lodate reacts with the 
chlorides present to form insoluble silver 
chlonde and soluble lodate the latter pass 
ing into the filtrate Upon addition of iodide 
to the filtrate the lodate reacts to produce 
free lodme which is then titrated with 
standard thiosulfate solution with starch 
as an mdicator

until the color of the solution in the flask 
becomes a pale yellow. Add 4 drops of 1 
per cent starch solution and continue the 
titration a drop at a time until the blue 
solution suddenly becomes colorless. The 
titration should require 20 ml. of the thio- 
sulfate solution if it is e.xactly 0.02303 N. 
If the volume titrated deviates by more than 
O.I ml., either change the figures in the 
calculation or dilute the thiosulfate solu- 
tion to exactly the correct normality. 

Technique 

1. Measure 0.5 ml. of serum into a 
50 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. 

2. Add 12.5 ml. of phosphoric-tungstic 
acid solution. 

3. Add 0.3 gm. of silver iodate from a 
calibrated spoon, stopper, and shake flask 
for about 40 seconds. 

4. Filter through S & S No. 589 filter 
paper. The filtrate must be perfectly clear. 

5. Pipet 5 ml. of the clear filtrate into 
a 50 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. 

6. Just before titrating, add 1 gm. of 
sodium iodide, using the roughly calibrated 
spoon, and immediately start to titrate with 
0.02303 N sodium thiosulfate solution 
from a 25 ml. buret with gentle shaking of 
the flask. Deliver the thiosulfate in rapid 
drops but not a stream until the color of 
the solution in the flask is pale yellow. 

7. Add 2 drops of 1 per cent starch 
solution and continue the titration until 
the blue color suddenly becomes colorless. 
Note; \Vhen a series of analyses is being 
done, treat each portion of filtrate ^viIh 
sodium iodide just before it is titrated. 

Calculations. Millimoles of chloride per 
liter = ml. thiosulfate titrated K 10 x 2 

Mg. of NaCl per 100 ml. = ml. thio-

Comments. A microprocedurc can be fol- 
lowed, utilizing 0.02 ml. of serum, 0.5 ml. 
of phosphoric-tungstic acid, and approxi- 
mately 15 mg. of silver iodate. For the test, 
0.2 ml. of clear filtrate is used and 0.05 gm. 
of sodium iodide is added just before titra- 
tion. The titration is accomplished by using 
0.02303 N thiosulfate solution, which has 
been diluted 1:2. When the pale yellow 
color is reached, add 1 drop of the starch 
solution and titrate until colorless. For the

is not sensitive to temperature changes and 
that does not require the addition of any 
thiosulfate as previously required hy other 
modifications The method is claimed to be 
extremely reproducible and uses a wave 
length of 480 millimicrons 

Baginski e£ ol (1958) have described 
three mduect microprocedures utilizing a 
polarographic method a silser dithizone 
technique and a mercunc chloranilate 
techmque The polarographic method re 
quires an mtemal standard techmque and 
the two absorptiometric procedures involve 
an exchange of chlonde for the anion of 
silver dithizonate or mercuric chloranilate 
with the concomitant hberation of dithizone 
or cbloranibc acid 

Recently the electrometric titration of 
chloride has become popular because the 
Instruments are produced commercially it 
allows the direct titration of chlonde in 
various biologic fluids utilizing micro 
quantities of serum and requires only one 
to two minutes for the entire titration For 
procedural directions the brochures sup 
plied with the Cotlove apparatus (1958) 
should be reviewed 


Bicarboitate 

The classic diagram of Gamble (Fig 
9 1) showing the various cations and 
amons compnsing the electrolytes of the 
blood may be easily mismterpreted to mean 
that the vanous electrolytes are static and 
remain m one position on their respecuve 
positive or negative sides This is not true 
for the vanous cations are moving about 
and are in balance with the vanous amons 
which are also moving about Alkali 
reserve or alkaline reserve is a term apphed 
to the concentration of plasma bicarbonate 
total carbon dioxide content part of the 
sodium and total cations The term alkah 
reserve is deriv ed from that time in history 
when the bicarbonate of blood was re- 
garded as undissociated sodium bicarbonate 
sodium bicarbonate was one of the alkalies 
of the alchemist Bicarbonate ions serve as 
a reserve m the sense that they can be 
displaced partially by other anions How 
ever at the present time alkali reserve has 
more than one meaning depending upon 
the individual use made of it The con 
fusion regarding the termmology of alkali 
reserve is shown in Fig 9-2

of the word “base " ( 1 ) Base has been used 
to mean the pnncipal ingredient of a com 
pound thus sodium is the base of sodium 
oxide which is capable of forming the 
alkali so^um hydroxide Another example 
phosphorus is the acldihablc base of phos 
phoric acid (2) Base has also been de 
fined in many dictionaries as a substance 
that reacts with an acid to form a salt 

(3) According to the Arrhenius theory of 
ionization in aqueous solutions a base is a 
substance that contains a hydroxyl ion and 
causes the disappearance of the acid 
properties m the neutralization reaction 
Conierscly an acid is a substance that 
when dissolved in water dissociates to yield 
a hydrogen ion and some negative ion The 
interaction of an acid and a base there 
fore is considered to be the combmation 
of the hydrogen ion released from the acid 
and the hydroxyl ion released from the 
base to produce water A base therefore 
has come to be identified with a substance 
having a hydroxyl ion 

(4) According to the more recent 
Bronsted schema a base is a substance that 
can gain a proton thus forming an add 
conversely an acid is a substance that can 
lose a hydrogen ion (proton) thus forming 
a base The Bronsted schema is important 
in that it also considers reactions in non 
aqueous solvents In which no ions would 
be formed It is unlikely that extremely 
small protons could remain free and un 


captured by other molecules or Ions in the 
solution Water molecules can capture pro 
tons released from other substances to 
form the hydrated hydrogen ion or hy 
dronium ion According to the Bronsted 
schema therefore we are dealing with the 
exchange of protons and not with simple 
dissociation Such changes exist between 
the proton donor (acid) and its conjugate 
proton acceptor (base) Thus carbonic 
acid is an add and its conjugate base is 
bicarbonate anion bicarbonate is a base 
in the Br0nsted schema and not an acid 
as It was called in the old, schema (Fig 
5-2) 

(5) Another chemical meaning of base 
is that considered in the Lewis theory of 
acid and base which defines a base as a 
substance that has a lone pair of electrons 
which may be used to complete the stable 
group of another atom According to this 
theory the proton per sc is the acid 

Many a hospital laboratory lists the term 
CO-. to avoid the confusion of the terms 
seen In various books — carbon dioxide con 
tent carbon dioxide capacity carbon di 
oxide combining power and carbon dioxide 
combining capacity these terms do not 
have the same meaning For projxrr evalu 
ation of carbon dioxide gas in the blood 
"arterial plasma" should be used such 
arterial plasma or serum is obtained from 
an artery from a capillary by fingertip 
puncture or from "artenalizcd blood" from

a vem (the arm being kept m warm water 
for several minutes to artenalize the blood 
before venipuncture) True plasma is ob 
tamed by collecting blood anaerobically 
and if any equilibration or alteration m the 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide is neces 
sary the changes are made before the 
blood cells are separated from the plasma 
Such true plasma iviU represent the buffer 
ing action of the plasma or serum and also 
of the red blood cells By contrast sepa 
rated plasma is also obtained by anaerobic 
collection of the blood but the blood cdls 
are separated from the plasma before any 
equilibration or change m the partial pres 
sure of CO is made such separated plasma 
will represent only the buffering action of 
the plasma or serum A greater change In 
carbon dioxide content can be withstood 
by true plasma m comparison to separated 
plasma before any change in pH occurs 

The total carbon dioiade content 
measures the sum of bicarbonate carbonic 
acid and dissolved carbon dioxide present 
in the patients plasma or serum It is de 
termined on the true plasma at the partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide present in the 
patients body without any equihbration 
with carbon dioxide a correction is made 
to 37® C 

The carbon dioxide capacity measures 
the sum of bicarbonate catbomc acid and 
dissolved carbon dioxide present in the 
plasma after equilibration to a partial pres 
sure of carbon dioxide of 40 mm of mer 
cury It may be equal to or greater or less 
than the carbon dioxide content (which is 
done without equihbration) The carbon 
dioxide capacity is determined on true 
plasma equihbrated with carbon dioxide 
from the technologists aUeoli or by use of 
a gas mixture containing 5 5 per cent 
carbon dioxide to a partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide of 40 mm of mercury (the 
tension of carbon dioxide found in normal 
alveolar air) at room temperature The 
capacity will be equal to the content if the 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide in both 
determinations (by equilibration or as 
found in the patients blood) equals 40 
mm of mercury When the partial pressure 
of the carbon dioxide in the patient s blood 
is less than 40 mm of mercury the capacity 
iMll be greater than the content when the 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide is 
greater than 40 mm of mercury the 
capacity will be less than the content 

The carbon dioxide capacity is not the 
same as the carbon dioxide combining 
power These two terms have been mter 


473 

changed the term carbon dioxide combm 
mg capacity which is also used could 
refer to either of the other two terms 
The determination of carbon dioxide 
combming power is a procedure done m 
most climcal laboratories usually on blood 
plasma or serum collected aerobically 
The carbon dioxide combining power rep 
resents the concentration of bicarbonate ion 
in the patients plasma equihbrated to a 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 40 
mm of mercury The technique is the 
same as for the carbon dioxide capacity 
but It IS performed on separated plasma 
(which should be collected anaerobically) 
A correction is made for the dissolved car 
bon dioxide The plasma or serum concen 
tration of bicarbonate Ion can be calculated 
from the total carbon dioxide content and 
the pH of the blood from the Henderson 
Hasselbalch equation The bicarbonate 
content may be determmed directly by a 
modified titration method (Nadeau 1953) 
or the value of the carbon dioxide combm 
xng power will represent the concentrauon 
The average normal bicarbonate concen 
tration in the adult is 27 mEq per liter 
Table 9-3 gives the factors fu necessary 
to calculate the bicarbonate concentration 
if the total carbon dioxide content and the 
pH are known The factor for the de 
termined pH value is obtained from the 
table the factor multiplied by the total 
carbon dioxide content gives the value for 
the bicarbonate concentration 

Carbonic acid m the plasma represents 
the undissociated acid as well as the carbon 
dioxide dissolved in the plasma The ratio 
of the dissolved carbon dioxide to the un 
dissociated carbonic acid is about 700 to 
1000 2 Because of the common ion effect 
there is very hitle hydrogen ion or hydron 
lum Ion floating around in the blood The 
preponderant bicarbonate salts are almost 
completely ionized or dissociated and thus 
the hydrogen lOn is displaced to form water 
and carbon dioxide which Is dissoUed in 
the blood or very small amounts of car 
borne acid The carbonic acid concentration 
can be calculated from the total carbon 
dioxide content and the pH utilizing the 
Henderson Hasselbalch equation the aver 
age normal concentration in the adult is 
1 35 mM (or mEq ) per liter The partial 
pressure of carbon ^oxide (Pco ) is a 
measure of the undissociated carbonic acid 
which IS mainly dissolved carbon dioxide

of carbon dioxide is 36 mm of mercury 
Alveolar CO-, can now be determined by 
infrared analvsis (Collier et al 1955) 
Tables 9-4 and 9-5 list the factors ob 
talned from the pH value to calculate the 
carbomc acid concentration (including the 
dissolved carbon dioxide) and the partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide (Pro«) The 
respecuve factor fc or fp is multiplied by 
the total carbon dioxide content to obtain 
the proper parameter 

In most laboratories the expression vol 
umes per cent of carbon dioxide which 
means miUihters of carbon dioxide gas dis 
solved in 100 ml of blood or serum has 
been replaced by the term milhequivalents 
or milhmoles per lifer Under standard con 
ditions one mole (1 M ) or 1000 miUimotes 
(1000 mM ) of carbon dioxide gas occupy 
22 26 L or 22 260 ml Volumes per cent 
times 10 equals the milliliters of carbon 
dioxide per hter and therefore the follow 
mg equation can be used 


mM /L = 


Volumes per cent X 10 

22 26 


or 


mAf /L = - 


The mathematics of division can be simph 
iied to convert to milliequivalents per hter 
by multiplymg the miUibters of CO per 
100 ml (volumes per cent) by the factor 
0450 (see Tafale 9 2} 

Since carbon dioxide expressed as mlili 
moles represents the determination of 
bicarbonate and 1 mM of carbon dioxide 
will jield 1 mEq of bicarbonate the two 
terms can be mterchanged so that CO de 
terminations can be expressed as milh 
equivalents per liter or as millimoles per 
liter 


CO2 Content 

Determination of the CO content is the 
technique to be preferred since this repre 
sents the concentration of carbon dioxide 
in the blood at the partial pressure found 
in the patient s body This determination 
has been stated to require special care m 
the collection and handling of the plasma 
or serum to msure that the content of gis 
does not change until the analysis is com 
pleted the blood should be collected with 
out exposure to air and transferred an 
mediately to a tube containing mineral oil 
Centrifugation theoretically should be done 
with paraffin oil or mineral oil on top of 
the blood and a cork floating in the mineral 
oil to keep the gas pressure under standard 


ized conditions However the collection of 
blood in a “Vacutainer tube does not re 
quire the cork or mineral 01 ! since the 
small test tube (eg 5 ml capacity) can 
be filled completely and the centrifugation 
done m the same tube without removing the 
stopper When the test is to be done the 
stopper IS removed rapidly and the aliquot 
IS removed The tube is then restoppered 
immediately to preserve the sample if it 
IS desired for a second determination or 
a pH determination 

Manometnc Technique of Vin Slyke and 
Ncill (1924) The usual Van Slyke mano- 
metric apparatus consists of a manometer 
graduated in millimeters and usually read 
to 0 1 mm a reaction chamber or buret 
IS used in which the blood gases are ex 
tracted and which is calibrated at 0 5 and 
2 0 ml (volumes to which the gas can be 
compressed when taking manometer read 
mgs) and at 50 ml (volume used to ex 
tract gases) The reaction chamber is con 
tamed wuhm a water jacket with a ther 
mometer used to determme the tempera 
ture of the water An intricate piece of 
glass tubing connects the manometer and 
the buret and this is called the "W ” There 
are four stopcocks in the apparatus Stop 
cock A is a three way stopcock allowing 
the addition of material via the graduated 
cup or addition funnel to the buret cham 
ber and also permitting the removal of 
material via the side ejection tube Stop 
cock B 15 between the leveling bulb and 
the buret and allows for control of the 
mercury reservoir with the use of the level 
ing bulb Stopcofck V is at the top of the 
mercury manometer Stopcock W is above 
stopcock B at the top of the W” and 
allows for ejection of gas and water which 
may accumulate at the top of the mercury 
in this glass manifold 

Most types of manometric Van Slyke 
apparatus today are controlled by a motor 
and rheostat to allow shaking of the buret 
with its water jacket However there are 
two recent models of the apparatus that 
should be mentioned One has a manome 
ter connected to the “W" by means of a 
ground glass joint this joint usually re 
quires grease to prevent air from seeping 
into the system The advantage of such a 
joint is that it allows for easier cleaning 
of the glass parts Another mode] of the 
Van Slyke apparatus is equipped with a 
magnetic stirring device and timer In addi 
tion to the glass ball and socket joints Be 
cause magnetic stirring occurs within the 
buret chamber so that the entire apparatus

Clinical Diagnosis b\ Laboratory Methods 


does not have to be shaken the two joints 
one between the manometer and the “\V" 
and the second between the “W* and the 
buret, hold well and do not permit much 
leakage 

Prtnctple The carbon dioxide of the 
blood exists chiefly m the form of bicar 
bonate which is decomposed to carbon di 
oxide by the addition of lactic acid The 
amount of gas present in a definite volume 
IS determined by the pressure it exerts in 
a manometer The released gases are ad 
justed to a known volume (e g , water 
meniscus at 2 ml ) and the pressure (p,) 
of the gas volume is read on the manome 
ter The carbon dioxide is absorbed with 
alkali and the pressure (p^) is read with 
the volume of residual gas at the same vol 
ume as before (2 ml ) The pressure fall, 
Pj— p, millimeters of mercury, is the pres 
sure that the carbon dioxide gas exerted 
at 2 ml The volume that the carbon dioxide 
would occupy at 0® C and 760 mm of 
mercury is calculated by multiplying the 
pressure fall (P) by a factor that is a func 
tion of the observed temperature

ilfainteuancc of apparatus The most 
common source of error in the manometnc 
techmque is leakage around the stopcocks 
Therefore all stopcocks should be lubn 
cated frequently so that they turn smoothly 
without stickmg and have a complete film 
of lubricant between the plug and the 
barrel 

If moisture collects in the manometet. 


It can be removed by adding 1 ml of the 
trimethylene glycol through stopcock V and 
allowing It to flow down the manometer 
for about 10 cm It is then forced out by 
raising the mercury in the manometer up 
through stopcock V The small amount of 
tnmethylene glycol remaining on the walls 
of the manometer will not afl'ect the ac 
curacj of the manometer readmg 

When the apparatus is not m use stop- 
cocks A and B should be open However 
stopcocks V and W are always kept closed 
and sealed with mercury The levebng bulb 
should be at the lower position the buret 
chamber and the addition cup should be 
filled with distilled water, and the cup 
should be covered with parafilm or a 
beaker 

Testing the Dryness of the Manome 
TER With the buret empty of gases and 
fluid and stopcock A closed lower the 
mercury level to the 2 ml mark and then 
close stopcock B The mercury surface in 
the manometer should be above that in 
the buret chamber by a height nearly equal 
to the vapor pressure of the water depend 
mg on the room temperature 

If the value for the height of the met 
cury is not as given in Table &-6 the de 
hydrating fluid should be renewed as just 
desenbed The oft staled test for dryness 
of the Van Slyke buret raismg the mercurj 
to obtain a “chek should not be done It 
IS not accurate and usually results in break 
age of the apparatus

2 Close stopcock B 

3 Raise leieling bulb with mercury 
to the upper position 

4 Open stopcock B close when all 
the water is out of the buret (Do not allow 
too much mercury to escape via the ejec 
tion tube ) 

5 Place leielmg bulb in lower posi 
tion Close stopcock A and then open stop 
cock B 

6 Add 10 to 15 ml of approximately 
0 1 N lactic acid to the buret via the addi 
tion cup Allow the 0 1 N lactic acid to 
enter the chamber b> opening stopcock A 

7 Close stopcock A 

8 Lower the mercury in the chamber 
to the 50 ml mark by opening stopcock B 
and lowering the leveling bulb below table 
level Then close stopcock B and return 
leveling bulb to the lower position 

9 The buret is shaken by a motor 
or by the magnetic stirrer for one half 
minute 

10 The acid and extracted gases are 
then ejected via the ejection tube as in 
steps 1 to 4 Note Be sure that all air 
collected in the trap below stopcock W is 
remov ed 

Technique The apparatus should be 
absolutely clean and free of leaks The 
mercury should fill the buret chamber and 
both capillaries of stopcock A should be 
sealed and closed with mercury Stopcock 
B IS open and the levehng bulb is in the 
lower position 

1 Add 1 drop of caprylic alcohol to 
the capillary in the addmon funnel 

2 Add 1 ml of carbon dioxide free 
distilled water 

3 Using a Van Slyke pipet run in 1 
ml of serum under the water m the addi 
tion cup holding the pipet tip near the 
bottom of the cup 

4 With cautious manipulation of stop 
cock A draw the serum and water into the

reaction chamber Do not allow any air to 
enter 

5 Add 1 5 ml of the 1 N latUc acid 
through the cup and draw mto the cham 
her by opening stopcock A Do not allow 
air to enter 

6 Seal and close stopcock A with a 
drop of mercury 

7 Evacuate the buret chamber by low 
enng the levehng bulb below table level 
When the mercury reaches the 50 ml mark 
close stopcock B 

8 Shake the buret by means of its 
motor or magnetic control for two minutes 

9 Place levehng bulb in upper position 
By careful manipulation of stockcock B 
mercury is readmitted slowly and without 
swirling until the gas volume in the buret 
chamber is reduced to the 2 ml mark (The 
meniscus of the water solution is at the 
2 ml mark ) Then close stopcock B Note 
The adjustment of the gas volume should 
not take over one half to one minute If 
the fluid meniscus passes the 2 ml mark 
more CO-. will be reabsorbed than is ac 
counted for in the calculations Therefore 
readjustment must be made by again low 
enng the mercury level to the 50 ml mark 
and re-extracting for one mmute 

10 Tap manometer with finger and take 
reading Pi 

11 Lower the levehng bulb below table 
level and open stopcock B so that the 
mercury level of the chamber is about ^ 
to inch below the upper shoulders of the

bulb in lower nng support 

23 Place about 0 5 ml of the 5 N NaOH 
into the addition cup By manipulation of 
stopcock A slowly run 0 2 ml of the NaOH 
into the buret chamber for absorption of 
the carbon dioxide 

14 After the alkah has been added a 
few drops of mercury are admitted via the 
cup to Aslodge any alkah adhenng to the 
underside of the stopcock and to seal the 
stopcock 

15 After the CO-, is absorbed (m about 
30 seconds) mercury is readmitted from 
the leveling bulb by manipulating stopcock

pnate factor for the temperature of the 
water jacket around the buret chamber 
The temperature factors given in Table 9-7 
are for the stated conditions using J ml 
of serum and a total volume m the buret 
of 3 5 ml and reducing the gas volume to 
the 2 0 ml mark

Comments The capryhc alcohol is used 
to prevent foaming, which would obscure 
the meniscus Instead of capryhc alcohol 
a 10 per cent silicone antifoam reagent can 
also be utilized

IS a vacuum in the buret chamber, the 
mercury memscus in the manometer 


Daboratorv jMethops 

should not move more than a few milh 
meters If the mercury rises appreciably, 
It indicates a leak at the reaction chamber 
stopcock, if the mercury falls, it indicates 
a leak at the manometer stopcock 
Acetone is used to clean the apparatus 
if this IS not sufficient, alcoholic potassium 
hydroxide (13 2 gm of powdered KOH, 85 
per cent pure) is dissolved to make up 1 L 
in absolute alcohol, this is a N/5 solution 
and can be used to remove all the grease 
and dried protein) To clean a manometer, 
open the cock at the top, draw the mercury 
into the leveling bulb, and disconnect the 
rubber tube leading to the bulb Replace 
with tubing from a suction flask Apply 
strong suction and draw water and then 
alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution 
through the manometer from the top Dry 
with acetone and then draw air through 
the tube to remove all traces of the acetone 
If necessary, instead of the potassium hy 
droxide solution, chromic sulfuric aad 
cleaning solution may be used followed by 
water, acetone, and air When the manome 
ter is filled with clean mercury, evacuate 
the tube several tunes to detach the film 
of air adjacent to the glass The air bubble 
IS then expelled through the cock at the top 
of the manometer 

To clean the extraction chamber between 
analyses, eject the solution remaining from 
the previous analysis through the cup and 
remove with suction Lower the level of the 
mercury to the bottom of the chamber and 
admit 10 to 15 ml of water Shake the 
chamber for a few seconds The water is 
ejected through the cup, then add 1 ml 
of 1 N lactic aad, lower the mercury 
level, extract by shaking and then eject 
the gases and the solution through the cup 
Any solution adherent to the walls is so 
nearly gas free that it will cause no error in 
subsequent analyses Do not allow the air 
to enter the chamber, since it will form a 
thin film on the wall and must be removed 
by evacuating or by cleaning Silicone 
grease should not be used for the stopcocks 
because alkali is used in this method 

Volumetric Technique of Van Slykc 
and Cullen (1917) The usual Van Slykc 
volumetnc apparatus consists of a buret 
in which the blood gases are extracted and 
which IS calibrated with many subdivisions 
up (o 1 0 ml and at 1 25, 1 50, 2 00, 2 50 
and 50 0 ml It has two stopcocks The upper 
one is a three-way stopcock, allowing the ad

The three positions of the mercury bulb 
reservoir shown In Fig 9-3 should be 
known in order to perform the technique to 
be described next 

Principle Serum or blood contains 
carbon dioxide primarily in the form of 
bicarbonate ion In order to measure this 
potential carbon dioxide it must be freed 
from combmation utilizing lactic acid 
which IS a stronger acid than carbonic to 
convert the bicarbonate ion to carbonic 


acid The carbonic acid (carbon dioxide) 
IS extracted under vacuum Complete re 
moval of the gas is not possible uith one 
extraction but if the amount of solution 
and the ratio of the liquid phase to the 
gas phase are kept constant the residue of 
carbon dioxide remainmg in solution can 
be calculated from the solubility coefficient 
and the temperature and pressure At the 
same time correction is made for the dis 
solved oxygen and nitrogen that are also 
released by the extraction in vacuo The 
actual volume of carbon dioxide extracted 
can be determined bj absorbmg the carbon 
dioxide with an alkali such as sodium 
hydroxide 

Reagents 

Same as described under manometnc 
gas apparatus Note Tlus procedure is for 
the determination of carbon dioxide con 
tent utilizing the volumetric apparatus 
The apparatus should be absolutely clean 
and free of leaks The mercury should fill 
the buret chamber and both capiUanes of 
the upper and lower stopcocks should be 
sealed and closed with mercury 

Technique 

1 Add one drop of caprylic alcohol 
to the bottom of the cup 

2 Open the lower stopcock to con 
nect to the trap on the right side and by 
controlling the upper stopcock allow the 
caprylic alcohol to run down into the 
capillary tube above the upper stopcock 
Mercury bulb should be at position 2 

3 Add a few drops of mercury over 
the caprylic alcohol in the capillary tube 
and seal the stopcock with mercury allow 
Ing the caprylic alcohol fo enter the ap- 
paratus 

4 Place 2 ml of 0 1 N lactic acid In 
the cup (This can be an approximate 
measurement using the markings on the cup ) 

5 Pipet 1 ml of plasma or serum 
mto the cup and run it into the chamber 
underneath the acid layer This is accom 
pUshed by keeping the leveling bulb in 
position 2 opening the lower stopcock and 
controlhng the delivery of the scrum and 
the lactic acid by means of the upper stop- 
cock The lactic acid is run in until the 
mercury reaches the 2 5 ml mark on the 
pipet 

6 Close both stopcocks and remove 
the excess lactic acid from the cup Place 
a drop of mercury in the cup and open the 
upper stopcock to fill the capillary tube 
and the bore of the cock to act as a seal

attached for shaking 

9 Lower the levelmg bulb to posi 
tion 3 and open the lower stopcock to 
connect the chamber with the trap on the 
right underneath the lower cock Dram the 
fluid (except for one or two drops) from 
the chamber down into the lower trap be 
ing careful that no gas enters It is best to 
control the flow of the fluid by means of 
the lower stopcock rather than by using 
the levelmg bulb Close the lower stopcock 

10 Turn the lower stopcock to con 
nect to the sidearm which is the narrow 
tube below the lower stopcock and allow 
the mercury to nse slowly m the apparatus 
by raismg the mercury leveling bulb 

11 Raise the leveling bulb and place 
at such a height that the surface of the 
mercury is at exactly the same level as the 
mercury in the apparatus 'ITie small 
amount of aqueous fluid can usually be 
neglected Note If more than 2 or 3 cm 
of solution IS above the mercury the height 
of the mercury in the leveling bulb sho^d 
be raised one thirteenth of the height of 
the aqueous column above the inside mer 
cury column 

12 Close lower stopcock and place the 
leveling bulb back in position % Read the 
volume of gas (at the aqueous meniscus 
not at the mercury level) Read this vol 
ume and record the temperature of the 
environment and the barometric pressure 
at the time of the determmation 

Note When domg the deterramaUon 
using plasma or serum the reading of the 
total gas volume may be taken as the finish 
of the determination Since no alkali is 
used It IS not necessary to wash the ap 
paratus between such analyses However 
if whole blood is analyzed so much oxygen 
IS mixed with the carbon dioxide that it 
IS necessary to absorb the carbon dioxide 
ivith alkali and also to wash the apparatus 
between readings

Kopp Natclson Microgasomctcr (1931 
I957J This apparatus utiiires only 0 03 ml 
of serum or plasma to determine the 
amount of carbon dioxide present in the 
blood plasma of serum Pnmarily it wU

Iccicd anaerobicallj OMara and Faulkner 
( 1959) ha\ c mechanized the Kopp Natelson 
microgasometer so that it is under precise 
fingertip control and climmates ^ the 
handling of the apparatus 

Carbon Dioxide Capacity 

The carbon dioxide capacity is performed 
in the same fashion utilizing the mano 
metric or the xolumetric apparatus of Van 
Slyke or the Xopp*NafcIson microgasometer 
It is done on blood drawn anaerobically that 
is equilibrated to a partnl pressure of 40 
mm of mercury before the red blood cells 
arc separated The partial pressure of 40 
mm of mercury represents the pressure of 
carbon dioxide found normally in the 
ahcoli of the lung Equibbration may be 
done by proper exhalation of alveolar air 
by the technician (or utilization of an 
apparatus delivering 5 5 per cent carbon 
dioxide) 

Whole blood is placed in a separatory 
funnel and the technician bloivs alveolar 
air into the funnel and then rotates the 
funnel in order to equihbrate the blood 
sample with the alveolar atmosphere ivithin 
the separatory funnel (see Fig 9-4) 



Ffjure 9-4 Apparatus used for satiiraung blood plasma with carbon dioxide Air js blown from the 
lungs into the tube at the left the stopper Js insert^ abd the separatory funnel rotated The air passes 
among the glass beads in the bottle which remove its moisture (After Van Slyke ) 



482 Clinical Diagnosis b> Laboratory Mmions 


Alveolar air is that air expired at the end 
of a normal expiration after a normal in 
spiration Unfortunately, hoY\e\er, many 
technicians take a deep breath and then ex 
hale this is not a true sample of aheolar 
air Other factors contributing to abnormal 
alveolar air samples are smokmg and colds, 
which cause variations in the concentra 
tion of carbon dioxide in different indi 
viduals 

Carbon Dioxide Combining Power 

The method of determining the carbon 
dioxide combining power also utilires the 
volumetnc or manometnc Van Slyke appa 
ratus but the blood is equihbrated to a 
partial pressure of 40 mm of mercury by 
using serum or plasma obtained presumably 
under anaerobic conditions after the red 
blood cells have been separated Caraway 
and ranger (1955") have modified the 
Kopp Natelson microgasometer technique 
to be able to obtain the carbon dioxide 
combining power rather than the carbon 
dioxide content 

Rosenthal and Buscaglia (1958) have 
described a sunple apparatus for equilibra 
Uon of the specimen with carbon dioxide, 
utilizing a small tank of gas containing 5 5 
per cent carbon dioxide and 94 5 per cent 
nitrogen and a needle valve assembly for 
regulaung the fiow of the gas to saturate 
the sample in a test tube Use of such an 
apparatus will result in a saving of tune 
for the technician and will give a greater 
degree of precision in the analyses of the 
carbon dioxide combining power and of 
the carbon dioxide capacity 

Utilizing the volumetnc apparatus of 
Van Slyke which is present in most general 
laboratories the following calculation^ can 
be used to detenmne the carbon dioxide 
combimng power which will reflect the 
concentration of bicarbonate in the blood 
The observed volume of gas (step 12 m

nunus the correction hsted in Table 9-10 
will equal the number of millihters of 
carbon dioxide found as bicarbonate in 
100 ml of serum or plasma 

Protein 

Protem is also one of the electrolytes of 
the blood, and at the normal blood pH of 
7 4 the protein, which is a zwittenon exists 
as an anion having a negative charge The 
amount of protem present in the blood 
will determine the amount of protein amons 
present thus, the factor for conversion of 
protem to the electrolyte equivalent is 
grams of protein per 100 ml times 2 43, 
which equals miUiequivalents of proteinate 
per hter (see Table 9-2) 

The factor 2 43 is a good approximation 
of the equivalents of protem under normal 
conditions and normiU pH The isoelecinc 
point of protems vanes and will affect the 
combining capacity of the carboxyl groups 
in the protein The formulas that give a 
more accurate descnption of the imlhequiv 
alents of the various protems are shown at 
the bottom of the page 

Phosphorus 

Phosphorus is present m practically all 
foods and is absorbed from the gastroin 
tcstinal tract more efficiently than calcium 
or magnesium If the dietary intake of 
calcium from milk is sufiident to meet the 
minimum daily requirements phosphorus 
requirements will also be satisfied On an 
adult diet with less milk consumption the 
intake of phosphorus usually exceeds that 
of calcium The metabohsm of phosphorus 
follows that of calcium m many respects 
About 10 to 20 per cent of the phosphorus 
however, is found In body tissues other than 
bone, it is the major amon found within 
the cells Phosphorus of soft ussues seems 
to have priority over bone for necessar? 
metabolic processes Of the phosphorus that 
IS excreted from the body, about 40 per cent 
is excreted via the feces and 60 per cent 
via the unne An average total of about 
30 mEq of phosphate cdculated as phos 
phorus or 0 93 gm are excreted per day 
vna the unne Vitamin D has little effect 
on phosphorus absorption via the gastro- 
intestinal tract, however, it does increase 
the tale of reabsorpuon via the renal 
tubules Other factors affecting the unnary 


mEq albumin/L = 0 125 (gm alb/L ) (pH — 5 16)

The normal plasma phosphorus Je%el is 
1 7 to 2 3 mEq per liter or 3 to 4 mg per 
100 ml In children the level is higher, 
being 2 3 to 3 5 roEq per liter or 4 to 6 
mg per 100 ml The serum or plasma 
phosphorus Is mainly in the form of m 
orga^c phosphate The serum phosphorus 
15 high in 'hypoparathyroidism and low in 
myperparathyroiism In patients on pro- 
longed milk and alkali intake the scrum 
phosphorus may he normal or elevated, 
whereas the serum calcium is high'^urmg 
penods of active growth serum phosphorus 
IS elevated, presumably owing to the effect 
of growth hormone, this is reflected in the 
higher levels seen in children The plios 
phorus present within the cells is essentially 
present as organic combinations It is the 
largest anion component found within the 
cells, about 80 mEq per hter of cell water 
The phosphorus content in the adult is 
about 11 6 gm per kilogram (fat free) and 
5 4 gm per kilogram in the newborn 

Dryer and his co workers (19S7) have 
described a method for determmmg in 
organic phosphorus using microquantities 
of plasma or serum Reducuon of the 
molybdenum is accomplished by the use of 
p-semldine hydrochlonde solution contain 
mg sodium bisulfite This reagent gives 
reproducible colors and a low color blank 

Method of Fiske and Subbarovv (1925) 

Pruiciple The inorganic phosphorus 
present in a trichloroacetic acid protem free 
filtrate of serum in the form of the ortho- 
phosphate reacts with molybdate in acid 
solution The blue color is formed from 
the resultant phosphomolybdate after the 
addition of a reducing agent to form a 
colloidal solution of molybdenum blue 
Various methods have different reducing 
agents used In the method of Fiske and 
Subbarovv aminonaphthosulfomc acid re-

Sulfate 

Sulfate of the blood has been determined 
by various methods eg by precipitation 
as banum sulfate and estimation gravi 
mecncalfy colorimefncally or tarbidimeen 
cally or by exchange with lodate giving a 
gasometne techmquc The precipiiauon of 
sulfate as benzidine sulfate will allow 
titration of the benzidine sulfate as an acid 
usmg an alkah or the benzidme may be 
estimated colorunetncally Various reagents 
giving color with the benzidine have been 
used The method of choice to be de 
senbed is that of Letonoff and Beinbold 
(1936) usmg sodium beta naphthoqumone 
4 sulfonate as the color reagent 

If the sulfate is expressed as sulfur the 
norma! blood serum contams 0 3 to 2 0 
mg per 100 ml or 0 2 to 1 3 mEq per 
liter If the sulfate is expressed as inorganic 
sulfate (S 04 “) the concentration in the 
serum will be 0 9 to 6 mg per 100 ml or 
0 2 to I 3 mEq per liter Since red cdls 
contain sulfur-contammg ammo acids and 
proteins the blood used should be separated 


as soon as possible to avoid hemolysis The 
amount of sulfate m the whole blood is 
about twice that found in serum it is best 
to do the determination on serum The m 
organic sulfate of the serum is increased 
early m renal insufficiency even before 
other tests reveal any change in renal func 
tion Increases have been noted in nephntis 
up to 6 to 8 mg of sulfur (S) or 18 to 24 
mg of sulfate (SO<=) per 100 ml of 
serum Any case of nitrogen retention m

blood exert very htUc effect as part of the 
total 5 mEq of organic acid ai^ns How 
ever in '^abeiic acidosis 'Starvation 
vdcidosts and other conditions the greatly 
increased amounts of ketone bodies will 
depress the concentration of bicarbonate in 
the blood 

In diabetes elevations up to 300 to 400 
mg per 100 ml may be seen In normal 
unnes up to 50 mg per day are seen 
while in diabetes 1 to 5 gm per 100 ml 
may be found most of this is in the form 
of betahydroxybutyric acid which does not 
react in the test to be desenbed The test 
is valuable m distmguishmg between true 
diabetic acidosis in which the serum ketone 
bodies will exceed 50 mg per 100 ml and 
surgical conditions in the diabetic in which 
the blood level rarely exceeds 20 mg pet

Method of Dumm and Shipley (1946) 

Principle Sodium nitroprusside in the 
presence of a weak alkali will give a purple

VOD BASE B VLANCE 

The concentrauon of the hydrogen ion 
in the blood is extremely small namely 
0 00000004 mole (M) per hter or 4 x 
10 * moles per liter Since the molecular 
weight of hydrogen is about I the concen 
traiion can also be expressed as 4 x 1(H 
gm per liter Because of difficulty in handl 
ing such numbers Sdrensen introduced the 
concept of pH which is defined as the 
negative logarithm of the concentration of 
hydrogen ion 

pH = - log [H-1 

The square brackets ( I represent the molar 
concentrauon of the substance Thus the 
cumbersome number 0 00000004 M per 
liter becomes 7 4 in the pH scale The blood 
pH (concentration of hydrogen ion) is pro- 
tected and controlled by the buffers — bi 
carbonate carbonic acid system hemo 
globin protein and phosphate — present m 
the blood The normal range of pH of the 
blood is 7 35 to 7 45 the pH range com 
patible vnth hfe is 6 8 to 7 8 Acid base 
balance can be described by the Henderson 
Hasselbalch equation 


pH 


- , 1 base 

+ ’‘’5 55d 


The major buffer system of the blood is 
the bicarbonate caibonic acid system Re 
ferral to the Bronsted schema of aads and 
bases will show that carbonic acid is the 
proton donor of this system and that bi 
carbonate anion is the conjugate proton 
acceptor or conjugate base Thus none of 
the cations sodium potassium magnesium 
and calcium are base nor are they acid 
They are cations The anions of the blood 
are all potential proton acceptors meamng 
that they can react with a hydrogen ion 
The anions therefore are “bases” in the 


BWnsted schema This is completely dif 
ferent from the old terminology in which 
the cations were called bases and the 
anions were called acids 

Thus the Henderson Hasselbalch cqua 
tion can be rewTitten to be expressed as 

„ ^ , HCO3- 

pH = pK + log 

The bicarbonate carbomc acid system is 
the true acid base relationship which re 
fleets the pH or the concentration of free 
hydrogen 10 ns in the blood The concentra 
tion of carbomc acid in the blood is de- 
termined by the functional capacity of the 
respiratory system and the concentration 
of the bicarbonate ion is determined by the 
functional capacity of the Ldneys The 
other blood buffers (hemoglobm protein 
and phosphate) play their role and via the 
kidneys determine the ultimate concentra 
tion of bicarbonate 10 ns of the blood The 
negative logatithm of the dissociation con 
Siam of carbomc acid is represented by 
pK and at body temperature is equal to 6 1 

pH = 6 1 + log ^ 

= 61 + log li 
S= 6 1 +13 
= 74 

Much confusion has resulted concern 
ing the terms aadosis and alkalosis Pren 
ously these terms had been reserved for 
the decrease or increase respectively cf 
the alkaline reserve They have also been 
used to represent a fall in pH (increased 
acidity) or a nse in pH (decreased acidity) 
of the blood Other mvestigators prefer to 
use the terms acidemia and alkalemia to 
represent the changes m blood pH How 
ever the term acidosis should mean a fall 
in pH below the level of 7 35 and alkalosis 
should mean a nse in pH above the level of 
7 45 without the use of the term alkahne 
reserve which should be discarded 


liicarbonnle Deficit 

Other names for this condition are 
bolic acidosis primary alkali defiat and 
imcompensated alkali deficit This condi 
tion may be caused by an excessive prodiic 
tion of organic acid anions excessive loss 
of cauons retention of anions therapy 
with mineral acids or salts and other mis 
cellaneous conditions Thus a falling cot

per liter will change the bicarbonate

carbonic acid ratio to 10 1 instead of the 
normal 20 1 ivith the decrease of the ratio 
there Is a decrease of the pH which is 
equal to 7 1 

Sicorbonnle Excess 

Sjnonyms for this condition are meta 
bolic alkalosis primary alkali excess and 
uncompensated alkali excess This condi 
tion may be caused by excessive loss of 
anions body deficit of potassium therapy 
mfh alkaline salts and Array ultraviolet 
or radium therapy An mcrease in the bi 
carbonate ion concentration for instance 
to 40 mEq per liter would increase the 
ratio to 30 1 instead of the normal 20 1 
the increased ratio would result in an in 
creased pH which would he equal to 7 5S 

Carliontc letd Excess 

This condition has also been called 
respiratory acidosis primary carbon dioxide 
excess uncompensated carbon dioxide 
excess gaseous aadosis and hypoventila 
tlon Some major causes are depression of 
the respiratory center excessive inhalation 
of carbon dioxide cardiac disease me 
chanical asphyxia respiratory muscle pa 
ralysis and pulmonary disease The pn 
mary pathologic alteration is impaired 
respiratory function so that tbere is an 
increase in the concentration of carbonic 
aad for example to 2 mEq per liter re 
suiting in a decrease of the normal ratio 
to 13 1 instead of 20 1 This decreased 
ratio results in a decreased pH which is 
equal to 7 21 

Carbomc And Defictt 

Synonyms for this condition are respua 
tory alkalosis primary carbon dioxide defi 
cit uncompensated carbon dioxide deficit 
gaseous alkalosis and hyperventilation 
Conditions that may result In such im 
balance are stimulation of the respiratory 
center fever or external high temperature 
anoxic anoxemia owing to high ^titudes 
hyperventilation syndrome and hystena 
and anxietj The pnmary pathologic change 
IS the result of a blov\ang*off of carbomc 
acid which causes an increase of the ratio 
for example if the carbomc acid is 0 67 
then (he ratio would be 40 1 instead at 
20 1 The increased ratio means an in 
creased pH which is equal to 7 7 in this 
case

Most pH determinations today are done

pH of plasma and of unne Singer et al

of the plasma pH utilizing a modification 
of the Shock and Hastings pipet

the glass electrode pH meter The individual 
commercial setups are accompanied by 
brochures which should be consulted It 
should be pointed out that the pH of the

formula that states that for every degree

^VATER ISALA^CE 

The normal adult vvho indulges in 
routine activities will have an intake and 
an output of water balanced in the range 
of 1500 to 3000 ml per day The mythical 
70 kg adult male may be in water balance 
with an intake of 2500 ml This amounts 
to about 24 per cent of his extracellular 
fluid which is contamed in the interstitial 
and intravascular compartments A normal 
intake will be maintained for the adult if 
be is suppbed with 30 ml of water per 
kilogram of body weight This will supply

Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods 


approximately 1 L. for loss oaring to in- 
sensible perspiration and 1 L. for urine 
excretion. A minimum total water output 
for the average adult is about 1500 mL 
day; about 900 ml. are required for in- 
sensible perspiration and 600 ml. for mini- 
mum urine excretion. 

The total body water consists of about 
70 per cent of the total body weight. This 
is divided into the intracellular fluid, about 
50 per cent of the total body weight, and 
the extracellular fluid, making up the other 
20 per cent- The extracellular fluid is di- 
vided into ie interstitial fluid, comprising 
about 15 per cent of the total body weight, 
and the intravascular fluid or plasma vol- 
ume. which makes up about 5 per cent of 
the total body weight. The concentrations 
of the electrolytes within the plasma are 
summarized in Table 9-2. 

In order to compare the concentrations 
of electrolytes within the plasma to those 
of the interstitial and intracellular fluid, 
the usual method of describing concentra- 
tion of electrolytes in blood expressed as 
nuiliequivalents per liter of plasma or mil- 
liequhalents pec liter of serum has to be 
changed to milliequivalents per liter of 
plasma or serum water. In this way similar 
units are used to express the electrolyte 
concentrations per liter of water in the 
intracellular compartment and the mter- 
stitial compartment. Since plasma contains 
approximately 92 per cent water, the vari- 
ous electrolytes will be about 8 per cent 
higher in concentrauon when expressed on 
the basis of per liter of plasma water Thus, 
instead of 154 mEq being the total cation 
concentration, it wdl now be approximately 
167 mEq. per liter of plasma water, and the 
anions sundarly ivill be increased to 167 
mEq. per liter of plasma water. In con- 
trast the total electrolyte concentration in 
the interstitial fluid is approximately 155 
mEq per liter of water because of the 
Donnan-Gibbs eqmhbrium. The protein 
concentrauon iviihin the intersuual fluid is 
much less, amounting to approximately 1 
mEq. per liter of mtersuual compartroeni 
water, on the other hand the cblonde con- 
centration is elevated to make up for this 
difference, being about 115 mEq. per liter 
of water. 

Though the relaiiie concentrations, ex- 
cept for the conditions of proteins and 
chloride just described, are similar in the 
intravascular or plasma volume compart- 
ment and the interstitial compartment, 
there is a decided difference in the pre- 


sumed concentration of electrolytes within 
the intracellular compartment. The sodium 
is much less evident, and potassium is the 
major cation present within the cells. In 
adihtion magnesium plays a major role as 
one of the Intracellular cations. In describ- 
ing the anions, the major anion is phos- 
phate, which is found in organic form 
within the cells; proteins make up the 
second largest anion component within the 
cells. Bicarbonate is reduced to approxi- 
mately 10 mEq. per liter of ivater, and 
practically no organic acids are present for 
analysis within the cells. 

Under ordinary circumstances approxi- 
mately 1 500 ml. of urine are excreted 
daily via the urinary tract. This is a xeiy 
small percentage of the total volume of 
water passing through the kidneys. The 
total glomerular filtrate, 120 ml. per min- 
ute. will amount to appro-xiinately 180 L 
per day Of this, approximately 85 per 
cent is reabsorbed in the proximal convo- 
luted tubules owing to the “obligatory" 
reabsorption of water and solutes. The 
remaining 15 per cent of the water pre- 
sented to the kidney tubules Is reabsorbed 
passh’ely: continued active reabsoiption of 
sodium creates an osmotic force that causes 
the reabsorption of water. The amount of 
water reabsorbed in the distal tubules (and 
collecting ducts) is under the influence of 
the antidiuretic hormone of the posteriCFr 
pituitary; antidiuretic hormone supposedly 
opens the hypothetical pores in the epi- 
thelial lining, an action analogous to the 
action of the antidiuretic hormone on the 
skin of amphibians. In the presence of 
normal amounts of antidiuretic hormone 
practically all the water presented to the 
distal convoluted tubules be reabsorbed 
so that only approximately 1000 ml. of 
water are excreted as the daily unne. fa 
the complete absence of the antidiuretic 
hormone diabetes insipidus will result, and 
volumes up to 20 or 25 L. of urine output 
per day have been reported. In such condi- 
tions the specific gravity of the urine wiIJ 
be very low, since there is no abnormal 
amount of electrolytes bemg excreted. 

The total solute output per day has a 
very definite relationsliip to the urine solute 
concentration and to the total urine volume. 
The usual adult intake of food results in an 
output of 1200 milliosmoles (mosM.) of 
solutes. At normal concentrations of ap- 
proximately 0.8 osM. per hter as exempu- 
fied by urine with a specific gravity of 
these solutes can be excreted In a dailj 



^VArLR AND E^.EC^ROL^ rES 


491 


urinary output of approximately 1500 ml 
of fluid Under fastmg conditions the total 
output of solutes per day is 800 mosM , at 
a concentration seen in a specific gra^ty 
of 1 020 the amount of unne per day 
needed for such excretion will be 1000 ml 
of fluid The administration of 100 gm of 
carbohydrate in the form of glucose to such 
fasting individuals %vill cut the solute load 
to 400 mosM per day and, under similar 
concentrations, will be excreted m a total 
volume of 500 ml per day The protein 
free glomerular filtrate issuing from the 
proximal renal tubules has a solute concen 
tration of approximately 0 3 osM per liter 
This unne will have a specific gravity of 
about 1 008 to 1 010 The average maximal 
solute concentration in unne is 1 4 osM 
per liter with a specific gravity of 1 035 
Under these conditions a person with 
normal kidneys excreting 1200 rnosM per 
day can under average maximum urme 
concentration, excrete these solutes m ap 
proximaiely 750 ml of fluid The fasting 
patient with an excretion of 800 mosM 
per liter who can concentrate maximally 
will accomplish this in a v olume of SOO ml 
of fluid The fastmg patient who is given 
100 gm of carbohydrate can excrete h»s 
400 mosM load in a total volume of 250 ml 
of fluid 

The daily unnary excretion of various 
electrolytes will vary with the mtake If a 
reduction occurs in the dietary intake of 
sodium there will be a concomitant dc 
crease of the sodium in the urinary output 
However, even on a potassium free diet 
some potassium will always be lost in the 
unne as a result of negative mtrogen bal 
ance owmg to tissue protein breakdo^vn In 
the adult the average excretion per liter of 
unne is 40 to 90 mEq of sodium. 20 to 
60 mEq of potassium and 40 to 100 mEq 
of chloride provided renal function is 
normal 

One of the major sources of fluid loss 
to the body is via the gastromtestmal tract 
Under normal circumstances only 50 to 
200 ml of water are lost in the semisohd 
feces However, during the course of a day 
approximately 8 L of fluid are secreted 
into the gastromtestmal tract via the juices 
from the salivary glands, bile pancreatic 
juice and Intesiiml juice Thus approxi 
malely 8 1- must be reabsorbed a volume 
approximately two to three times that of 
the normal plasma volume The concenlra 
tion of electrolytes will vary m the various 
secretions of the gastrointestinal tract The 
gastric secretions are high in chloride and 


low in sodium content, the potassium con 
centration is about three times that found 
in plasma Fluid obtained from the pancre 
atic or ileal regions of the intestinal tract 
has a high sodium and a relatively low 
chloride content, but the potassium con 
centration is again higher than that found 
in plasma The bile secretion has a com 
position approximating that of the extra 
cellular fluid, whereas juices from the 
jejuna! region of the gastrointestinal tract 
have almost equal concentrations of sodium 
and chloride 


Plasttin Volume 

The plasma is the only compartment of 
the body water that is easily accessible for 
various defemunations For routine pur 
poses the volume of the intracellular fluid 
is not determined the extracellular fluid 
which consists of the interstitial fluid and 
the intravascular fluid (plasma volume) 
are the other compartments The plasma 
volume bears a direct relationship to the 
weight of the individual For the adult male 
the average plasma volume is 4 5 per cent 
of the body weight this can be expressed 
as 45 ml of plasma per kilogram of body 
vveight with a range of plus or minus 5 ml 
per kilogram In the adult female the aver 
age plasma volume is 4 per cent of the 
body weight or 40 ml per kilogram with 
a range of 35 to 45 ml per kilogram In the 
newborn infant the plasma volume is 
higher, having an average of 5 5 per cent 
of the body weight or 55 ml per kilogram, 
with a range of 50 to 60 ml per kilogram 

Plasma volume may be determined in 
directly by use of the following formula 


pv. = PV, 


..Hb, (l-Hctj) 
(l-Hct,) 


in which PVi is the initial (assumed) 
plasma volume, PVa is the new (calculated) 
plasma volume, Hcti and Heto are the in 
jual (previous) and new hematocrit dc 
terminations respectively (expressed as 
fractions of unity), and Ilbi and Hb-i arc 
the initial (previous) and new hemoglobin 
determinations respectively In (he use of 
this formula it is assumed that the hema 
tocrit and hemoglobin determinations arc 
accurate and represent lil parts of the vas 
cular bed The initnl plasma Js also as 
sumed, the assumed plasma volume can be 
calculate from the percentage of the body 
weight as just discussed Thus, PV 2 — PVj 
will be equal to the positive or negative

Another formula involving only the de 
termination of the total serum proteins has 
also been used for the serial observations 
of a pauent

where PV^ and PV» are the initial (as

formula certain precautions must be re 
membered no large amounts of protein

Method of Gregerson (1938 1944) 

Principle Evans Blue or Tolidene 1824 
IS a blue dye that bmds totally to serum 
albumin and is therefore retamed mthin 
the plasma space Since the dye escapes 
from the blood very slo^vly a knowledge of 
the exact quantity of dye injected mto the 
blood and the detennination of the conceit 
tration in the plasma will alloiv the calcu 
lation of the entire space in which the dye 
has been diluted 

It IS extremely important that the synnge 
used for the injection of the dye be accu 
rately calibrated so that the exact volume 
injected is known all the injected solution 
must enter the blood Lipemia and hemoly 
SIS should be absent Evans Blue has an 
absorption maximum at 610 millimicrons 
however in the presence of plasma protein 
the absorption maximum shifts to 620 milh 
microns 

Reagents 

a Evans Blue dye which is available 
commercially m ampules contain 
ing 5 ml of a 0 5 per cent aqueous 
solution 

b Vials of sterile saline suitable for 
intravenous injection 50 ml size 
c An accurately calibrated 10 ml 
syringe calibrated so that the exact 
quantity is knoivn eg 9 995 ml 
for the injection 

Tcdintqtie The patient should be fast 
ing to avoid hpemia and should be at rest 


before the test is performed Glassware and 
instruments should be thoroughly cleaned 
and dry The syringes and needles should 
be coated with silicone to reduce hemoly 
SIS samples should be discarded if there 
IS much visible hemolysis The test tubes 
to receive the samples should contain a 
small amount of dry heparin or sodium 
potassium ammomum oxalate anticoagu 
lant The blood specimens should be drawn 
after the tourniquet is released to avoid 
stasis which will distort the hematoent 
reading a difference of hematoent readmgs 
between the blank plasma sample and the 
dye plasma sample indicates stasis in draw 
mg of the blood A macrohematocrit should 
be done spinnmg the tubes at 3000 r p m 
for at least 30 minutes 

1 Empty a 50 ml vial of sterile saline 
except for 7 or 8 ml vvhich will remam 
inside Transfer the contents of one vial 
(5 ml of a 0 5 per cent aqueous solution) 
of T 1824 Evans Blue dye to the saline bot 
tie and mix thoroughly 

2 Fill the accurately calibrated 10 ml 
synnge with the diluted dye The calibra 
tion factor must be known for this syringe 

3 Withdraw a 10 ml sample from the 
patient who is in the postabsorptive state 
and resting and whose tourniquet has been 
released before the blood sample is taken 
Place the blood in a test tube containing 
a minute amount of dry heparin Mix 
gently 

4 Leave the needle m place and inject 
the dye from the cahbrated synnge making 
certain that all the dye enters the vein 
This can be done by nnsmg the synnge 
three times with blood and reinjecting 
Note the time 

5 Without stasis (tourniquet released) 
withdraw 10 ml of blood from the opposite 
arm of the patient 15 mmuies after the 
original injection of the dje Place the 
blood in a dry test tube containing dry 
hepann 

6 Aliquots of the control blood and of 
the dye contaimng blood should be taken 
to do the macrohematoent

Comments Various dyes, such as Evans 
Blue, Congo Red or Brilliant Vital Red, 
may be used to measure the plasma and 
blood volumes However, Evans Blue is the 
dye of choice, since its blue color allows 
the use of red filters or wavelengths m the 
red part of the spectrum to minimize the 
effects of hemolysis Shapiro (1951) has 
descnbed a simphfication, which requires 
only one determination without a control 
plasma m cases of emergency He feels that 
the plasma blank, although theoretically 
correct, is of questionable value in view 
of problems arising from differences in 
turbidity and hemolysis between the blank 
and the dyed specimen Caster et al 
(1953) have descnbed a direct method ns 
ing Zephiran as the solvent rather than 
saline to avoid the errors caused by the ab 
sorption of the dye on the glass surface 
and on the plasma proteins themselves 
Salt concentrations and pH effects will also 
cause variations m the amount of absorp 
tion of the dye These authors have adapted 
the method for use with only 0 02 ml of 
plasma in the experimental animal 

Method with 

Storaasli and his associates (1950) em> 
ployed human albumin tagged with to 
determine the plasma volume of humans 
Erickson et al (1953) have descnbed an 
improved method for the determination of 
the blood volume, using a scintillation 
counter Levey et al (1953) have descnbed 
the vanous laboratory factors influencing 
the use of radioactive iodine to determine 


plasma volume The values obtained by 
such techniques are total blood volume, 
60 to 85 ml per kilogram, plasma volume 
35 to 60 ml per kilogram, and red cell 
volume, 25 to 40 ml per kilogram These 
results are quite reproducible by vanous 
techniques Blood cell mass and blood vol 
ume and plasma volume are also being 
mvestigated with the use of radioactive 
isotopes of phosphorus, potassium iron, 
and chromium 

Water Content of Tissues 

The water content of tissues has always 
been determined in the past by oven dr> 
mg usually for 72 hours, and then obtain 
ing the difference in weights before and 
after drying MacDonald and assoaates 
(1959) have described a rapid method for 
the determmation of water in serum utihz 
mg a desiccation technique with an infra 
red lamp for a period of three hours The 
most rapid method for determining water 
content, especially of blood or serum and 
plasma is by the use of the Karl Fisher 
reagent, which can determine blood and 
tissue water in vwo and trt vitro Davis and 
his co-workers (3953) have described a 
method using an electrometric endpomt for 
this titration Mitchell and Smith (1948) 
have written a book on the subject of 
aquametry

Because the fat content of the bodv vanes

“A fact In itself is nothing It is valuable 
onlv for the idea attached to it or for pxoof 
which It furnishes ” — Claude Bernard 


Up to now the words m this chapter have 
described how to accumulate “facts" o” 
figures The data so gathered will b“ of no 
use to the phvsiaan unless thev help answer 
a question Are the data consistent with ih* 
suspected cluucal condition’ ^\’hal progress

mg The total bodv water content of a per

mpoTtani a smaller reserve to combat de- 
fa jdianon without the development of un

As mentioned previously total bodv wa

fat the greater water content m males is 
correlated to the sm^er fat content in this 
sex. In addition the water content changes 
with age so that the average water contert 
in a genatnc male is 51 per cent and in 
the genatnc female 45 per cent of the total 
body weight 

The only bodv compartment easily ac- 
cessible for evaluation of the concentrauon 
of electrolvtes is the intTava«iCular compart 
menl — the blood The plasma volume is

only about 5 per cent of the body weight 
so that the mythical normal 70 kg adult 
male has a plasma \olume of about 3500 
ml Even if the plasma volume is deter 
mmed (by injection of Evans Blue T 1824 
or by using radioactn e-labeled substances) 
in addition to determining the concentra 
tion of electrolytes in the plasma the re 
suiting product will yield the total amount 
of the particular substance in the vascular 
tree and no information is garnered con 
ceming the total amount present in the 
body For instance a patient with con 
gestxve heart failure and edema will have 
an excess of total body water and total body 
sodium The blood concentration of sodium 
may be normal or even more likely de 
creased On the other hand a patient with 
a total body potassium deficit owing to 
severe malnutrition may have an elevated 
normal or decreased potassium concentra 
tion m his serum 

Although plasma volumes can be deter 
mined under routine conditions many 
laboratones do not perform this procedure 
or only carry it out on pauents prior to 
or after major surgery The combination of 
plasma volume and servim concentration 
of the substance can be of great use m 
medical problems e g early congestive 
heart failure to differentiate dilution hypo 
natremia from hyponatremia owmg to se 
vere salt restriction The same low value 
for serum sodium may be seen in both 
conditions but the plasma volume will 
probably be increased (or “normal ) in 
the former and normal (or “decreased”) 
tn the latter condition 

The average total body water of the 
young adult male has been given as 60 per 
cent of the body weight the usual average 
for the intracellular and extracellular com 
partments are 45 and 15 per cent lespec 
tively of the body weight The mtracellular 
water is computed as the difference between 
the total body water and the water held in 
the extracellular spaces Recent advances 
in radioactive tracer work have shown that 
the value for the intracellular compartment 
IS too large because the extracellular com 
partment now includes mote than the intra 
vascular fluid and interstitial fluid included 
previously in this category The plasma vol 
ume water is 4 5 per cent of the body weight 
The interstitial fluid compartment (12 per 
cent of the body weight) also Includes the 
lymph and a rapidly equilibrating phase of 
the connective tissue The major portion 
of the connective tissue and cartilaginous 
tissue contains water equal to 4 5 per cent 


of the body weight Extracellular water 
found m bone also equals 4 5 per cent of 
the body weight The smallest amount of 
water (1 5 per cent of the body weight) is 
found in the transcellular compartment 
which IS fanned by the transport actultj 
of certain cells certain cells of the gastro 
intestinal tract (e g sabvary glands pan 
creas bver and biliary tract mucous mem 
branes and the intraluminal fluid) epi 
derma] cells (e g slon and mucous mem 
branes of the respiratory tract) kidneys 
cerebrospinal fluid humors of the eye and 
endocrine secretions (e g thyroid and 
gonads) Thus the body water comprises 
60 per cent of the bod) weight (adult 
male) but the new values for the intra 
cellular and extracellular compartments are 
33 and 27 per cent respectively of the 
body weight 

The osmotic pressures of the serum and 
urine are usually expressed in terms of mil 
Uosmoles per hter There is a semantic dif 
ference depending upon the technique of 
measurement between osmolarity and os 
molabty for our purposes the two terms 
may be considered synonymous Most work 
has been reported in terms of milbosmoles 
per liter e g the milbosmolar concentra 
(ion of normal plasma is about 2Q0 mosM 
per liter of plasma and on the basis of per 
liter of plasma vvater the concentration is 
about 310 mosM Talbot et al ( 1959 ) use 
the reciprocal or milbhters per milbosmole 
their normal range is 270 to 285 mosM 
per liter which is equivalent to 3 7 to 3 5 
ml per milbosmole 

A decreased blood volume will be marked 
by circulatory dysfunction as evident by 
hypotension weak thready pulse cold 
clammy extremities and cyanotic mottling 
of the skin such circulatory insufficiency is 
best treated by proper replacement of the 
blood volume constituents If the circula 
tory embarrassment is the result of cardne 
or vascular failure rather than hypovolemia 
the better treatment would be vasopressor 
agents rather than volume replacement 
Table 9-1 1 shows various examples of re 
duced blood volume and some determina 
tions that allow for a proper differential 
diagnosis A pure” body water deficit (c g 
owing to diabetes insipidus) of 120 ml per 
kilogram would produce a 20 per cent re- 
duction of the blood volume the concen 
tnitions of sodium total protein and hemo-

following a patient after a parathyroidec 
tomy to be sure that the dietary intake of 
calcium IS sufficient or to determine 
whether hypocalcemia is the cause of the 
convulsions in the patient mentioned pre- 
viously A negatne SuUtmvitch reaction de 
notes that the renal threshold for calcium 
excretion has not been exceeded, this im- 
plies that the serum total calcium level 
must be below 7 5 mg per 100 ml 

If intravenous calcium therapy is to be 
given to such a patient, a blood specimen 
should be taken prior to therapy for subse 
quent determination of the levels of cal- 
cium, phosphorus, alkalme phosphatase, 
and total proteins for proper evaluation of 
the status of the parathyroids and bone 
metabolism At leisure the urinary excretion 
of calcium and phosphorus should be deter- 
mmed on a known low calcium intake (Aub 
diet), or the determination of tubular re 
absorption of phosphate (TRP) should be 
done for a more complete evaluation of the 
status of the parathyToid glands It must 
be remembered that chronic renal insuffi 
ciency may result in secondary mvolvemem 
of the parathyroid glands 

Phosphorus is involved with calcium me- 
tabolism, but It IS also related to the pitui 
tary growth hormone The serum level of 
phosphorus is elevated m children (Table 
&-2) This Is presumably due to ^owth 
hormone activity The serum phosphorus 
(in the absence of parathyroid or renal 
disease) is elevated in periods of active 
growth as in children or in patients with 
excessive growth hormone activity (e g , 
the active phases of gigantism or acro- 
megaly) Conversely the phosphorus level 
IS decreased dunng active transfer of 
sugars from the blood to the ceils Glucose 
enters the cells as glucose 6 phosphoric 
acid, presumably m the form of the potas 
Slum salt of this strong acid 

This transfer of phosphorus with glucose 
has been shown to occur in the course of a 
glucose tolerance test The phosphorus and 
potassium levels in the blood are virtual 
mirror images of the changing levels of 
glucose dunng the course of the tolerance 
test in a normal individual In severe dia- 
betes there Is no drop of the phosphorus 
(and potassium) level correlatmg to the 
Impaired passage of glucose into the cells 
Minor impairment of the phosphorus 
change Is seen in patients with relatively 
mild diabetes This finding is of great ad- 
vantage in the temporary therapy of acute 
hyperkalemia if no \i\odialysis apparatus 
IS available Thus m a 2 month-old child

nriEq per liter the potassium level was 
brought down to 5 mEq per hter bj the 
intravenous administration over a 24 hour 
penod of 300 ml of 10 per cent glucose 
in water to which 10 units of regular in 
sidin had been added 

So far mention has been made primarily 
of the cations Phosphorus was discussed 
m relation to calcium metabolism and to 
carbohydrate metabobsm It should be em 
phasized that phosphorus ^vlU be ele\ated 
in the presence of renal msufficiency wth 
retention of nitrogenous products (azo 
temia) In addition sulfate is elevated early 
in the course of renal insufficiency — even 
prior to the elevation of the mtrogenous 
components Unfortunately sulfate is not 
determined in most laboratories but when 
it can be done it is of great help m evalu 
ating early cases of renal insufficiency 
Another group of anions not usually de 
termmed in the course of electrolyte studies 
is the organic acids Normally lactic aad 
and pyruvic acid, for example, are found 
in small quantities, the total concentration 
being equal to 5 mEq per liter In the 
course of congestive heart failure liver 
dysfunction, or severe exertion the lactate 
level can and does nse very quickly to high 
levels In the presence of tabetic acidosis, 
starvation acidosis, or relative lack of car 
bohydrate in the diet there is a great in- 
crease m the concentration of ketone bodies 
in the blood Usually an accumulation of 
phosphate, sulfate, lactate, or ketones will 
result in a decreased bicarbonate (carbon 
dioxide content, for example) 

Plasma proteins are usually considered 
as part of hver function, but it should not 
be forgotten that this large amount (by 
weight) of material m the blood does act 
as anions, since at the pH of the blood the 
protem molecules (zwjttenons) have a 
negative charge The variations in plasma 
proteins do not have so great an effect on 
the concentration of bicarbonate as do the 
other anions (which are excreted by the 
kidneys) 

Chlonde ion usually follows the same 
pattern of metabolism as sodium, but when 
the bicarbonate level is altered the chloride 
is usually changed in a reciprocal fashion 
Noteworthy to remember, however. Is the 
correlation of chloride with potassium in 
cases of metabolic alkalosis as seen in 
primary hyperaldosteronism, there is a 
hypokalemic, hypochloremic, metabolic 
alkalosis Somewhat forgotten today is the 
major retention of chloride Ion In cases of

lobar pneumonia the lack of knowledge Is 
correlated to the lack of exposure to full 
blown cases of lobar pneumonia In this 
respiratory disorder there is a great reten 
uon of chlonde in the tissues (and blood) 
until the “crisis” at which time the practi 
cally nonexistent urinar> chlonde excretion 
increases irernendousl) wih the consequent 
loss of the retained chloride from the tissues 
and blood 

The a>erage physician does not take ad 
vantage of the use of a battery of electrolyte 
determinations for the best e\a!uation of 
his patient A routine electrolyte study 
should be performed on all patients who 
are to undergo gastrointestinal surgery or 
a laparotomy and on all patients no matter 
how mmor their ailments who are past 
50 years of age The basic electrolyte battery 
consists of sodium potassium chlonde 
bicarbonate (eg carbon dioxide content) 
and pH determinations — all done at the 
same lime One can quickly check on the 
electroneutrahty by adding the cations 
sodium and potassium and the anions 
chloride and bicarbonate the respective 
values (Table 9 1) are 142 + 5 = 147 and 
27 + 103 ^ 130 The average patient who 
does not exhibit any tetany can be assumed 
to have a normal level of calaum and mag 
nesium so that the total cations would ^ 
147 + 7 ^ 154 mEq per liter The dif 
fcrcnce between the 154 cation value and 
the 130 anion value is 24 showing that 
the sulfate phosphate organic acids and 
proteinate are norma! (Table 0-1 and Fig 
»-l) 

An example of pathologic changes is 
seen in a young adult diabetic male whose 
four major electrolytes are found to be 
sodium 122 potassium 4 chloride 79 and 
carbon dioxide content 5 Adding 122 + 
4 + 7 (for calcium and magnesium) equals 
133 mEq per liter Adding 79 + 5 + 24 
(for “normal” residual anions) equals 108 
mEq per liter leaving a deficit of 25 mEq 
of anions which consist of ketone bodies 
and perhaps a small nse of the sulfate and 
phosphate depending upon the status of 
the Udneys 

The total clectrolvte osmolanty of this 
diabetic patient Is 222 mosM per liter 
instead of the normal 289 mosM per liter 
However the osmolar defclt is not 67 
mosM per liter because the increased sugar 
present In the blood of this diabetic patient 
is exerting an osmotic effect greater than 
that owing to a normal blood sugar level 
A sugar concentration of 100 mg per 100 
ml exerts an osmotic pressure of 5 5 


mosM per liter If the patient has a blood 
sugar of 650 mg per 100 ml the “excess" 
550 mg of sugar per 100 ml will exert 
an "extra” osmotic effect of 30 mosM per 
liter Thus the mllliosmolar deficit is not 
67 but 37 mosM per liter If any azotemia 
is present the elevated urea will exert an 
“extra osmotic eflect A normal urea nitro- 
gen of 20 mg per 100 ml exerts an osmotic 
pressure of about 7 mosM per liter If the 
patients urea nitrogen were 7o mg per 
100 ml the “excess” 55 mg of urea nitro- 
gen per 100 ml would exert an “extra" 
osmotic effect of 19 mosM per liter Thus 
the fmal net milhosmolar deficit would be 
only 18 mosM per liter Our diabetic pa 
uent exhibits hyponatremia bypochloremia 
and a decreased bicarbonate but the 
“tonicity" of his plasma is closer to his 
norma! because of the elevated blood sugar 
and elevated urea nitrogen Tlius the ratios 
of solutes to water (mdliosmolcs per hier) 
and of water to solutes (rmUditers per 
milhosmole) are fairly close to normal and 
the blood volume is close to normal 
The last value of the "electrolyte batten ” 
die pH denotes the ratio of bicarbonate to 
carbonic acid In this case the pH was 7 06 
The various factors for pH 7 06 can be 
obtained from Tables 9-3 9-4 and 9-5 to 
calculate the actual bicarbonate as 4 5 
mEq per liter the carbonic acid as 0 5 
mM per liter and the Pto as 15 5 mm 
Hg That there has been some compensation 
of the metabohe acidosis owing to diabetes 
Is shown by the reduced carbonic acid (and 
reduced P^o ) panial compensation is 
achieved by processes leading to respira 
lory alkalosis Such changes are portrayed 
in Fig 9-5 which pinpoints the status of 
the patient (carbon dioxide content 5 and 
pH 7 06) at a point at which the ratio of 
bicarbonate to carbonic acid is about 9 to 
1 this Is actually so with the calculated 
values (4 5 and 0 5) 

A patient with duodenal obstruction has 
the following electrolyte data sodium 13B 
potassium 5 chloride 49 carbon dioxide 
content 42 and pH 7 55 The towl cations 
138 + 5 + “T equal 150 and the t^al 
anions 49 + 42 + “24” equal 115 The 
anion defclt of 35 mEq is actually ^^dc 
up by the presence of 5 mEq of ^ , 'in 
anions (phosphate and sulfate) and 30 
mEq of ketone bodies Despite tl e greatly

9-5 shows the ratio of bicarbonate to car

9-5 the actual bicarbonate is found to be

A two year-old child is admitted to the

equal 147 and the total anions 105 + 13

or perhaps a negative imbalance of 5 mEq 
of amons In addition the unne is found 
to contam some ketone bodies and a trace 
of reducing substances The findings of 
hyperventilation low carbon dioxide gly 
cosuna and ketonuria can easily lead the 
physician down the path to a diagnosis of 
diabetic acidosis In this case therapy with 
insulin is contraindicated until a more 
definitive diagnosis can be made In ah 
youngsters presenting such findmgs the 
possibility of salicylate mtoxication must be 
considered 

A blood pH will confirm the accurate 
history at this stage (during the early

bicarbonate of 12 64 mEq per liter a 
carbonic acid of 0 36 mM per liter and 
a Pco« of 12 mm Hg Thus there has 
been some attempt at compensation of the 
respiratory alkalosis (low Pco ) by renal 
changes leading to metabolic acidosis 
(further lowering of the bicarbonate) 
Figure 9-5 shows the ratio of bicarbonate 
to carbomc acid at pH 7 65 to be about 
37 to 1 the calculated lalue for the re 
spectne concentrations 12 64 and 0 36 is 
35 to 1 

At a later stage of salicylate intoxication 
there may be a shift of the blood pH to 
the acid side which tvould comphcate the 
differential diagnosis betiveen diabetes and 
sahcyhsm Eten in the face of a low pH 
the physician must consider and rule out 
salicylate mtoxicanon before msatuung 
insulin therapy If facilities are available 
for determmmg the blood salicylate level 
the problem can be easily solved However 
even in the absence of such laboratory 
facilities the diagnosis can be made m the 
emergency room by the utilization of Ger 
hardts test for diacetic acid Gerhardts 
feme chlonde test for diacetic acid is a 
poor test m comparison to the nuroprvisside 
tests to determine acetoacctic acid It will 
be recalled that salicylates mterfere with 
Gerhardts test Therefore Gerhardts test 
should be performed on two portions of 
unne one of which has been acidified with 
concentrated nunc acid and boiled for at 
least one minute and then cooled pnor to 
performing the test The vanous reactions 
and their connotations are shovm in Table 
9-12 It should be emphasized that both 
diacetic acid and salicylate may be present 
in the same unne specimen this is espe- 
cially so m the case of an adult diabetic 
v\ho has been taking aspinn 

Another simple test to help the thinking 
physiaan is the determmanon of ketone

In diabetic acidosis the plasma ketones are 
usually greater than 50 mg per 100 ml

in cases of sahcylate mtoxicauon Again it 
must be remembered that both conditions 
may coexist m the same patient and that it

Microbiocliemical TecKniques 
in Pediatrics 


By DONOUGH O’BRIEN, M D , M R C P , and 
TRANK A IBBOTT, F I.M L T 


In recent years pediatricians have come to 
make steadily increasing demands on the 
clinical biochemical laboratory Such a de* 
\elopment was, In particular, the logical 
consequence of realizing the Importance of 
correcUng distortions in volume and in 
quality of the body fluids in the mctabobc 
diseases It became desirable to develop 
methods that required onl> small quantities 
of blood and serum — in the hrst place be 
cause observations were likely to be re 
quired repeatedly, especially in small in 
fants, and in the second place because the 
practice of taking larger blood samples 
from the femoral, jugular, or even scalp 
veins is notoriously disturbing to the very 
sick infant In children’s hospitals and to 
a lesser extent in general hospitals with 
large pediatric departments this progress 
has been expanded to Include the whole 
range of clinical chemistry, and some par- 
ticularly elegant techniques have recently 
been developed for the detection of con- 
genital enzymatic defects in the homozy- 
gous and heterozygous states, as for ex- 
ample. that of the red cell phosphogal 
actotransferase in galactosemia 

The practice of mlcromcthods in the 
large general clinical laboratory lends fre 
qucntly to be avoided owing to the widely 
held belief that it is not possible to obtain 
sufiicJently reliable results unless there Is 
available a chemist who has been especially 
instructed in these methods and who has 


had long experience with them As with 
any skill, of course, frequent practice is 
essential to achieve perfection, but an 
appreciation of the fundamentals of micro- 
techniques wiU eliminate much unsatis- 
factory work In practice it his been found 
unnecessary to resort to ultra micropro- 
cedurcs, which do not always ht into the 
routine of busy clinical laboratones or of 
changing staffs although the automatic 
polyethylene delivery pipets of Sanz, which 
are being marketed with an appropriate 
spectrophotometer by Beckman. Inc . as an 
ultra mJcroanaiysis system may well re 
store confidence in these techniques (Fig 
10-1) In the methods described later. 0 1 
ml Js the most general measurement of 
serum or plasma and it requires no more 
than 0 23 ml of plasma to gii'e consistently 
trustworthy results for sodium, potassium, 
chloride, and COj estimations Tlie purpose 
then of this chapter Is not to promote 
micromethods exclusively but, first to cm 
phasize that the competent mastery of a 
relatively small number of techniques can 
satisfy the principal demands of a pediatric 
department and, second to point out that 
a significant number of these techniques 
can be incorporated with profit into the 
routine of any chemical laboratory on 
account of their economy in time and ma 
tcnals. reproducibility, and robustness The

COLLECTION OF BLOOD 

An adroitly performed heel pnck is less 
txamnauc for a small infant than any one 
of the contentional i empunctures and it 
has the addiuonal advantage that It is 
more simple to repeat frequently In general 
It has b«n found that ether is the most 
satisfactory agent tvith which to clean the 
skin for the blood will then remain in 
discrete drops whereas alcohol will cause 
the blood to spread moteo'er should any 
alcohol come in contact ivitfa the blood 
hemolysis iviU occur It is inadvisable to 
use ether on patients in incubators and in 
these cases Wescodyne has proved satis 
factory the skin having been wiped dry 
with stenie cotton before the puncture is 
made The apparatus taken to the bedside 
is illustrated in Fig 10-2 and contains the 
following equipment ether Wescodyne

each patient (Hemolets have not been found 
satisfactory ) and nmless 1 *4 inch x ^

Band Aids In order to avoid hemolysis and 
contamination vnth tissue fluid after a 
needle puncture it is essential to obtain a 
free flow of blood and this may require a 
little gentle “milking" squeezing must not 
be resorted to at any time The small vein 
running posteriorly to the internal malle^ 
lus and onto the sole of the foot is likely 
to yield very freely and this should be 
pierced at the pomt where it passes onto 
the sole whenever possible A careful and 
dehberate puncture should be made in con 
trast to the rapid “stab " which may ^ 
used on the fingertip The blood should 
dnp freely into the coUectmg tube and 
should fall at once through the mmend oU 
It is permissible to touch the top of the 
tube onto the drop but the skin surface 
should at no time come in contact 'vltn

or a child s foot in a bowl of water at about 
37° C for some tuo minutes After the 
extrcmitj has been dried it is usuallj pos 
sible to obtain a free flow of blood 

Directlj after the collection a cotton ball 
IS placed on the puncture site and pressure 
applied for a short time Wicn the blood 
flow has ceased a Band Aid is placed o\er 
the puncture site The tube of blood is 
coNcred with the rubber cap and the speci

the laboraior> a llagcdom needle is passed 
aery gently between the blood and the wall 
of the tube to release an> clot In the un 
heparinized tubes the cap is then replaced 
and the sample spun dowm for about five 
minutes at 3000 rpm in a clinical centn

PIPLTS FOR MICROMCTHODS 
A^D TIIEIR USE 

The pipets used are those normall> found 
in a biochemical laboratory with certain 
additions A pipet calibrated to contam" 
Is capable of greater accuracy than one 
calibrated “to dell\er’* and the former 
should be used for the measurement of 
samples and standard solutions whenc\er 
possible Examples of the first typo are 0 1 
ml and 0 2 ml Folm pipets 'to contain'' 
and Kirk transfer pipets (Microchemical 
Specialties) a\allable in a wde range of 
capacities One of the cheapest and most 
satisfactory means of pipetting off scrum or 
plasma \vith these pipets is a tubercubn 
syringe with about inch of flexible 
rubber or plastic tubing attached to the 
nozzle The plunger of the syringe is lubri 
cated with a thin film of rubber grease or 
silicone grease and mineral oil A special 
syringe control is available for Kirk pipets 
'These pipets must be used as illustrated in 
Fig 10-3 The pipet should be held \erti 
cally allowing the tip to enter the sample 
If there is a layer of mineral oil a few 
moments must be allowed until the oil 
has retreated from the tip and then the 
plunger of the syringe is gently wthdrawn 
until the sample has been drawn up exactly 
to the mark 'The walls above the mark 
should not be wetted because this will 
introduce an error The outside of the pipet 
is then wiped with a tissue and all adhering 
liquid removed the sample now being 
slowly expelled into a diluent Usually the 
sample will sink in a steady stream to the 



Figure 10-3 Technique for pipeitms off plasma 

bottom m which case diluent from near 
tlie top IS taken up to the mark and very 
slowly expelled care being taken that the 
pipet tip remains quite still so that the 
descent of the dilute sample will not be 
disturbed This washing process is repeated 
once It IS possible in this manner to make 
accurate transfers of plasma and of aqueous 
and organic solutions When the diluent is 
a protein precipitant it is much more satis 
factory to wash the scrum or plasma into 
distilled water and subsequently to add 
the protein precipitant in double strength 
rather than to wash the serum directly into 
the more dilute precipitant 

An example of a pipet calibrated to 
deliver” is the Lang Levy pipet which de 
fives its precision from the fact that the 
zero point is self setting The sample is 
drawn a short distance above the constnc 
tion and then the memscus is allowed to 
adjust Itself within the constriction In 
emptying the tip is placed in contact with 
the side of the receiving vessel and a shght 
positive pressure is applied via a mouth 
piece and tubing to start the dehvery The 
pipet IS allowed to empty by gravity and 
when the memscus stops moving the re 
mainder of the fluid is carefully blown out 
This type of pipet should be used only when 
ft IS not possible to use a 'Svashouf pipet 

CLEAMNG or GLASSWARE 

When estimations are earned out on 
small quantiues it is of the utmost impor 
tance to set high standards m the cleanmg 
of ^assware An overnight soak in Haemo- 
sol solution (1 oz to 1 gallon of water) 
and a nnse m tap water followed by a

should be of reagent grade 

Plasma CO* Conlenl 

The Kopp-Natelson microgasometer is 
a robust piece of apparatus capable of 
measuring plasma CO content on 0 03 ml 
of plasma In practice the only diRiculties 
with this apparatus are small leaks around 
the jomts and stopcocks These can be 
preiented by careful greasing with a high 
\acuum nonsilicone preparation but it is 
also desirable to ha\e aiailable a spare 
manometer and gas chamber which can be 
qmckly substituted while the other set is 
bemg cleaned Teflon stopcocks are adns 
able

When usmg micromethods it is un 
practical to measure CO combinmg power 
and for this reason there arises the rather 
minor disadvantage of having to tale 
samples for CO* content under mineral ofl

Plasma and Sn-eat Clilortde 

The measurement of plasma chloride, 
particularly in association witj COj con 
tent, offers in children a good index of ad 
dosis and alkalosis and of the overall osmo- 
lality of the extracellular water, provided 
there is no excessive lipeiraa Normal val 
ues he between 97 and 104 miUlequiva 
lents per liter, much lower values being 
found in such conditions as pylonc stenosis, 
m other instances of persistent vomitmg 
m overhydration and in rarer states in 
which intracellular tonicity has changed 
with a resultant migration of sodium and 
chlonde into the cell Somewhat high val 
ues normally occur in the thirsted small 
infant at around the fourth day of life High 


chlonde values will also be found in hyper- 
chloremic acidosis and in hypertonic de- 
hydration 

Siveat chloride is probably the smgle 
most significant test in the diagnosis of 
fibrocystic disease of the pancreas The 
range of values from the literature for 
nonnals of 24 8 mEq per L (2 0 to 1 II 8 ) 
and 121 mEq per L (49 6 to 220) for 
fibrocystic patients, suggests a rather 
greater degree of overlap, in spue of the 
wide difference m the means than is gen 
erally experienced in any one laboratory 
This IS probably because the figures are 
compiled from a number of sources using 
different methods (Barbero, 1959) As a 
general rule It is rare for a normal person 
to have more than SO mEq per L of chlo 
nde in his sweat and for a fibrocystic pa 
tient to have less Some patients with chron 
1C bronchitis or asthma as well as presumed 
heterozygotes for fibrocystic disease may 
have intermediate values 
Cerebrospinal fluid chloride can also be 
estimated, using a procedure identical to 
that for scrum Normal values range from 
no to 128 m£q per L , being slightly low 
(103 to 116 mEq /L ) in acute purulent 
bacterial meningitis and lower still (94 to 
100 m£q /L ) m the htcr stages of tubercu 
lous meningitis 

Undoubtedly the simplest and best 
method for the estimalion of chloride in 
serum, sweat, or cerebrospinal fluid is the 
amperometne one of Cotlove et al (1958) 
However, for laboratories not equipped with 
a chlondometer the followmg adaptation 
from Van Slyke and Hiller (2947) of 
Sendroy’s lodometric procedure is given

The range of normal values for total 
serum calcium depends to some extent on 
the method employed In the following 
method which is that of Diehl and EUing 
boe (1956) the range lies between 9 4 and 
112 mg per 100 ml These values are 
slightly lower than those for the oxalate 
precipitation method and on average 0 6 
mg per 100 ml below tliose obtained by 
flame photometry Much higher values be 
tween 12 and 18 0 mg per 100 mi are 
found in idiopathic hypercalcemia vitamin 
D intoxication and hyperparathyroidism 
By contrast low serum calcium levels are 
encountered in hypoparathyroidism in 
pseudohypoparathyroidism in chrome renal 


failure secondary to hyperphosphatemia 
m all forms of rickets in postacidotic 
hypocalcemia in hypoalbuminemia and in 
infantile tetany 

In this method calcium m highly alkaline 
solution forms a bright yellow green fluores 
cent complex with calcein a condensate of 
unmoacetic acid and fluorescein In the 
presence of disodium dihydrogen ethylene 
diamme tetra acetate the calcium is 
chelated and the calcein reverts to an 
orange*red nonfluorescent form This tech 
nique is quite reproducible and accurate 
and IS unaffected by magnesium The end 
point is not entirely satisfactory in day 
light or m yellow artificial hght and should 
never be read in direct sunlight It can be 
improved by usmg white fluorescent light 
mg and by observing from above against 
a black background By far the best result 
however is obtained by using polaroid sun 
glasses and viewing the reaction under a 
long wave ultraviolet lamp The endpoint is 
indicated by an abrupt disappearance of the 
bright yellow green fluorescence 

This method has an additional advantage 
m that it can be simply adapted for the 
assay of calcium m urine with the use of 
inorpholme Mix thoroughly 2 ml of unne 

1 ml of 66 per cent sodium tungstate and 

2 ml of morpholine allow to stand for one 
hour Centnfuge and titrate a 20 aliquot 
of supernatant as for serum (Homer 
1955) 

The technical details here relate to the 
use of the Beckman Spmeo microtitrator 
(Fig 10 6) but the procedure can be 
simply adapted to other microburets by the 
use of a magnetic stirrer If necessary the 
quantities can be scaled up

Higher levels between 4 2 to 9 5 mg per

are found m chrome renal disease in 
hypoparathjToidism and pseudohypopara

The present method depends on the for 
mation of phosphomolybdate when serum 
is added to ammonium molybdate and the 
subsequent extraction of the phosphomolyb- 
date into an organic solvent An intense 
blue color is formed when the extracted 
phosphomolybdate is reduced by stannous 
chloride The most important sources of 
error come with any delays either m re- 
moving the serum from the red cells when 
phosphorus may be split from esters in the 
cells or in precipitating the serum proteins 
which may lead to the release of inorganic 
phosphorus from phospholipid and hence 
an incorrectly high result The supernatant 
after protem precipitation will keep for at 
least 48 hours The method to be given in 
detail is that of McDonald and Hall (19o7)

Neonatal jaundice may be caused by Rh 
ABO or other blood group incompatibihiles 
by sepsis and in the small premature infant 
simply by hepatic immaturity in the con 
jugation of bilirubin Although a le\el of 


20 mg per 100 ml is generally accepted 
as an indication for exchange transfusion 
this procedure is not without nsk in the 
smaller babies and for that reason rather 
higher levels may be tolerated when they 
occur on or after the third day of life 
The following method adapted from 
Lathe and Ruthven (1958) is a quick and 
rebable diazotization procedure It is im 
portaat however when a single tube or 
cuvet is used for aU readings to make sure 
that there is no contammation of the blanks 
by diazo reagent

6 Standard The problem of produc 
JDg an entirely satisfactory standard solu 
lion has not yet been completely solved 
because of a number of difficulties For ex 
ample commercially available bilirubin is 
often impure making it necessary for each 
batch to be assayed carefully A solution of 
bilirubin dissolved in chloroform gives a 
^azo pigment of higher intensity than a 
solution of bilirubm dissolved in a protein 
medium Even when a pure sample has 
been successfully dissolved in a protem solu 
tion (he resulting standard starts to detcri 
orate significantly after three hours A 
suitable cntenon of bihrubin purity is that 
It should have a molar extinction coefficient 
in chloroform of 60 000 assuming a molecu 
lar weight of 584 Dissolve 10 mg bilirubin 
in 1 ml 0 05 N NaOH Dilute to 50 ml with 
5 per cent human serum albumin solution 
This standard should be used as soon as 
possible and is treated exactly as a serum 
sample Dilutions may be made in 5 per cent 
human serum albumin to calibrate the 
photometer which should give a linear rela 
Uon with optical density

Alkaline phosphatase activity is increased 
m two groups of diseases those affecting 
liver function and those affecting osteo- 
blastic activity in the bones In hepatic 
disease an increased alkabne phosphatase 
Is gcncrall) accepted as an indication of 
bihar) obstruction In the second group the 
scrum phosphatase activity is increased in 
primary liYTcrparathyTOidlsm in secondary 
hyperparathyroidism due to chronic ren^ 
disease and also in the various forms of 
rickets whether these arc due to vitamin D 
deficiency malabsorption or renal tubular 
dystrophies Levels may also be Increased 
in von Recklinghausen s disease with bone 
involvement and a variety of malignant 
infiltrations of bone Low values for the 
alkaline phosphatase are found In hyper 
ihyroidism and in the rare condition of 
idiopathic hypophosphaiasia in which low 


values are associated with nckets and the 
excretion of phosphoethanolamine in the 
urme Normal values in childhood vary 
considerably (Child Research Council 
1960) Between one and three months they 
range from 4 4 to 13 6 Bessey Lowry units 
(BX U ) thereafter there is a steady fall 
to between 3 4 and 91 BLU for the 3 
year to 10 year age group At puberty 
values nse again averaging 7 BLU for 
the range between 3 4 and 15 5 This rive 
occurs at a slightly younger age in girls 
than in boys After the pubertal rise there 
is a steady fall until the adult range of 
08to23BLU is reached at about 16 
years Boys have shghtly higher levels than 
girls during this penod 

The most suitable method for the estima 
tion of alkaline phosphatase in serum in 
children is probably that of Bessey LowTy 
and Brock (1946) In this procedure serum 
is added to a solution of pnltrophenjl 
phosphate m an alkaline buffer The 
amount of phosphatase is reflected in the 
production of p mtrophenol which has a 
pronounced yellow color The addition of 
base inactivates the phosphatase and di 
lutes the color to a convenient concentra 
tion for measurement The blank Is 
measured after making the solution acid 
when the yellow color of the pnltropheiiol 
disappears

■y^Iilood Urea Nitrogen 

The estimation of various nitrogenous 
metabolites in serum is at best a rather 
crude gauge of renal decompensation 
Nonetheless these estimations are of sub 
stantial chmeal value and in our opinion 
the blood urea nitrogen is the most useful 
entenon and one of the easiest to adapt to 
small amounts of blood 


In the present method blood is exposed 
to urease after which the proteins are pre 
cipitated The ammoma formed is esti 
mated colonmetricaJly by use of Nesslers 
solution The normal values at all ages 
range up to 20 mg per 100 ml although 
It should be remembered that in small in 
fants on a very high nitrogen intake the 
value may nse over 30 mg per 100 ml 
without evidence of renal disease

! CiUmaUon of Serttm Proteins by the 
hjeldaht Vet/iod 

In the estimation of scrum proteins there 
are some attractive shortcuts Total pro- 
teins for example can be measured by re- 
fraction methods and total proteins and the 
albumin fraction separately by the biuret 
method In our experience however the 
present Kjcldahl method Is not only quick 
but exceedlngl) reliable and reproducible 
However for clinical purposes the esuma 
tion ol the albumin globulin ratio gives in 
formation that is of signlficanllv less value 
than that offered by the separation of the 
albumin and the various globulin fracuons 
by electrophoresis The optimum way of 


Laboratorv Methods 

estimating serum proteins in a clinical lab- 
oratory is therefore to estimate total pro- 
tein by the Kjeldahl method and the sev 
eral fractions by electrophoresis whenever 
this Is possible Although this entails some 
delay in obtaining a final answer the actual 
technician time consumed in applying dc 
veloping and calculating an electrophoretic 
stnp IS rather less than that involved in 
separating out albumin as a fraction and 
estimating its nitrogen content separately 
^Details of electrophoretic procedures and of 
scanning and elution methods are described 
in Chapter 8 but for the benefit of those 
laboratories not equipped for electrophor 
esis the method for the separate estimation 
of albumin is given here The normal values 
for serum protein fractions in the plasma 
are given in the following table It is im 
portant to emphasize that during the first 
four months of life there is a substantial 
fall in the levels of gamma globulin which 
rise only slowly thereafter to a normal adult 
level at around four years of age Smaller 
nscs but without the dip at three months 
occur in ^Ipha 2 and beta globulins 
The techmque of the Kjeldahl procedure 
IS simple and involves first the conversion 
of protein nitrogen to ammonium sulfate by 
digestion with concentrated sulfuric acid/ 
and a selenium catalyst After the digest Is 
alkalimzed the ammonia is steam distilled 
into a bone acid indicator solution (Con 
way 1938) which Is then back titrated 
with acid The method to be set out has 
been derived from a number of sources 
(Hiller el al 1948 Fawcett 1954) and 
spcaal attention is called to the apparatus 
which IS illustrated in Fig 10-7 it is not 
only simple but avoids a transfer of the 
digest

Serttm Albumin 

A simple albumin globulin ratio is not 
of great value and whenever possible quan 
titated 'electrophoretic fractions should be 
reported However the following method 
(Majoor 1947 Kingsley 1942 Jackson 
1959) for serum albumin is pro\ed and 
reliable The most important practical point 
IS to ensure that all glassware and solutions 
are kept as near to 37® C as possible dur 
ing the procedure 

Technique Wash 0 2 ml of serum mto 
3 0 ml of 27 73 per cent sodium sulfate in 
a glass stopper tube mix and mcubate 
at 37° C for three hours Add 1 5 ml of 
ether and mix the contents by inversion 20 
times allowmg the ether vapor to escape at 
mterials The mixture is then centrifuged 
at 2000 rp m for ten minutes ivith warm 
water in the centrifuge bucket The tube is 
then gently slanted to dislodge the button 
of precipitated globulin and a Pasteur 
pipet IS gently inserted to remove the sub 
natant fluid into another tube

Serum and Cerebrospinal riuid Glucose 

Differences in the glucose content of red 
cells and plasma as well as the effect of 
cell enzymes in vitro make the assay of 
glucose more reliable m serum (separated 
withm 30 minutes from the cells) than in 
whole blood The estimatian is important in 
diabetes and in detecUng the low values 
in premature infants m the first few days 
of life The measurement of serum glu 
cose is also necessary in various toler 
ance tests including those after doses of 
leucme glucagon msulm and glucose it 
self and m the mvestigation of idiopathic 
hypoglycemia of infancy and of vanous 
pituitary and adrenal disorders In the nor 
mal newborn fasting levels range between 
20 and 80 mg per 100 ml but occasion 
ally values of 10 mg per 100 ml or even 
less are encountered in infants who appear 
to be m perfect health Thereafter the nor 
mal fastmg level ranges between 60 and 
about 105 mg per 100 ml 

Cerebrospinal fluid glucose is normally 
between 40 and 80 mg per 100 ml It is 


low or absent in acute purulent bacterial 
meningitis and between 10 and 20 mg per 
100 ml in the early stages of tuberculous 
meningitis 

Of the vanous methods available for 
measunng serum glucose those involving 
glucose oxidase have the advantage of be 
mg specific but some of the procedures do 
involve a delay of neatly an hour before 
a result can be obtained The following 
method adapted from that of Marks (1959) 
IS both specific and quick and provided a 
rather stnct timing schedule is adhered to 
the results are reproducible and the stand 
ards linear

All the tubes are placed in a rack in a 
20° C. water bath together ■with the bottle 
of mixed enzyme reagent. When all are at 
20° C. (that is, after about five minutes), 
3.0 ml. of reagent is added to each tube at 
half-minute intervals, mixing after each ad- 
dition. The color is read at exactly nine 
minutes in the absorptiometer at 625 m/*, 
Using water as the reference. 

The calibration is linear up to at least 
300 mg. per 100 ml. blood. If the color is 
too high, however, less supernatant fluid 
should be used and the volume made up 
tvith water. The color is maximal at nine 
minutes, but the calibration is linear for at 
least 20 minutes, provided the time of read- 
ing remains constant for both tests and 
standards. 

iUXylose Absorptiou Test 

Malabsorption states may occur in small 
children as a sequel to any severe illness 
and in particular to gastroenteritis. Never- 
theless the most common diagnostic prob- 
lems for which absorption tests are required 
are in the diagnosis and differentiation of 
the celiac syndrome and fibrocystic disease 
of the pancreas. In the latter condition the 
diagnosis is now most effectively made by 
measuring the sweat chloride, and absorp- 
tion tests only play a supportive part in the 
diagnosis, although it may clearly be im- 
portant to know whether malabsorption is 
occurring as a gauge of the need for, or 
efliciency of, pancreatm therapy. In the 
malabsorption of fibrocystic disease a vita- 
min A-alcohol tolerance test is probably the 
quickest and most convenient for a reason- 
able degree of reliability. Xylose absorption, 
however, may be normal in states of pan- 
creatic insufficiency so (hat this test is the 
test of choice both in diagnosing and as- 
sessing treatment in the celiac syndrome. 

The procedure is carried out as follo^vs 
(Benson et al, 1957; Roe and Rice, 1948): 


■The fasting child is given 10 ml. per kg. of 
a 5 per cent solution of d-xylose and is sub- 
sequently fasted and thirsted for five hours. 
The urine is collected over this period, and 
after recording the total volume, an aliquot 
Is preserv’ed in the deep freeze. Blood sam- 
ples are taken before the test starts and at 
60 and 120 minutes after the xylose Is 
given. In a normal person the serum xylose 
should reach a level between 25 and 40 
mg. per 100 ml. at one hour, a level that 
should be maintained for another 60 min- 
utes, In malabsorption states, the highest 
level obtained is around 10 mg. per 100 
ml. In the urine of a normal person an 
average of 26 per cent of ingested xylose 
is excreted ^vith a range from 16 to 33 per 
cent. In malabsorption states, the mean is 
5.2 per cent and the range, 3.2 to 10.4 per 
cent. 

Reagents 

1. P'Bromoaniline reagent. Thiourea 
is added to glacial acetic acid in excess of 
the amount that will dissolve. Approxi- 
mately 4 gm. of (biourea per 100 ml. of 
acetic acid is used. Decant 100 ml. of 
acetic acid saturated with thiourea and dis- 
solve 2 gm. of pure p-bromoaclline (East- 
man Kodak Company) in it. Keep the 
p-bromoaniline reagent in a dark glass bot- 
tle and prepare once weekly. 

2. 0.3 N NaOH. 

3. 5 per cent ZnSOi-THjO. Reagents 
2 and 3 should be equivalent (see blood 
glucose). 

4. Slock standard. 1 per cent d(+) 
xylose in saturated benzoic acid. Working 
standard (5 mg./lOO ml.). Dilute stock 
solution 1:200 ivith saturated benzoic acid. 

Technique 

1. Into a tube containing 1.0 ml. of 
distilled water wash 0.2 ml. of whole blood 
followed by 0.4 ml. of 0.3 N NaOH. After 
mixing, 0.4 ml. 5 per cent 2 inS 04 is added 
and the mixing repeated. The tube is then 
centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. 

2. To separate 10 ml. test tubes, add

Serum Mucoprotetn Tyrostne 

The present practice of ambulatory treat 
ment of rheumatic fe\er with relauvely 
large doses of steroids has entailed some re 
evaluation of the laboratory tests for diag 
nosis and assessment of this disease At 
the present time the most valuable pro- 
cedure both m the imual stages of the dis 
ease and in determining progress with or 
without steroids is the serum mucoprotem 
tyrosine The normal mean by the method 
to be given (Weimer and ^^oshln 1953 
^\lnzle^ et al 1948 O'Brien and fbbott 
1959) IS 3 3 mg per 100 ml with a stand 
ard deviation of 1 mg per 100 ml The 
assay depends first on the separation of 
the mucoprotems from other serum pro 
teins using perchloric acid in which the 
former are by definition soluble The mu 
coprotems are themselves then precipitated 
b) phosphotungsuc acid redissolved in 
sodium carbonate and quantitatively as 
sayed on the basis of the color produced by 
the reaction between their exposed ly 
rosme residues and Folm and Ciocalteu s

low the direcuons for this method me 
ticulously in order to ensure reproducibtl 
ity Great cate must be taken not to lose 
any of the very small precipitate of mu 
coprotein especially when aspirating the 
supernatant liquid Phenol should be ex 
eluded from the room while the tests are 
being conducted

'^Serum Cholesterol 

Serum cholesterol in the normal child 
vanes wthm such wide limits that its es 
timation has only a very limited applica 
tion indeed On the first day of life the 
normal mean is 74 mg per 100 ml (48 
to 98 mg per 100 ml ) and this value 
nses to 132 mg per 100 ml (69 to 173 
mg per 100 ml ) between the third day 
and the end of the first year Thereafter 
normal levels are only a little lower than 
in the adult, ranging from 138 to 242 mg 
per 100 ml with a mean of 1^ mg per 
100 ml 

Cholesterol levels are characteristically 
elevated in diabetes nephrosis hypothy 
roidism and biliary obstruction and in 
those rare cases of idiopathic hyperchoJes 
terclernia and hyperlipemia, they are de 
pressed in hyperthyroidism and hepatitis 
and sometimes in cases of severe anemia 
or infection In none of these instances 
does the measurement of serum cholesterol 
rank as more than a subsidiary test In 
nephrosis for example serum protein elec 
trophoresis provides a substantially more 
sensime Index of diagnosis and progress 
The differential measurement of free and 
estenfied cholesterol has been adsocated as 
a test of diffuse Iner disease Here there is 
a decrease in the ester fraction as there is 
also in Infants during the first month of 
life The estimation of these fractions Is a 
time consuming operation and certainly in 
pediatric practice is not warranted 

The cholesterol method to be given was 
adapted from that of Carr and Drcktcr 
(1956) and was developed at the Hospital 
for Sick Children in London (see O’Brien 


and Ibbott 1959 p 49) It is certainlj the 
method of choice on the basis of repro- 
ducibility, accuracy and ease of perform 
ance In this instance cholesterol is meas 
ured by the Liebermann Burchard color 
reaction after the serum proteins have been 
removed by precipitation — but without the 
necessity for any preliminary extraction 
saponification or precipitation of the 
cholesterol itself The only drawback to this 
technique is that with raised bilirubin levels 
an interfering red color is produced In 
these instances one must resort to a more 
elaborate digitonin precipitation method

Tests of Hepatic Function 

By HYMAN J ZIMMERMAN, M D. 


The Liv£Ji is a complex organ, which per- 
forms many metabolic functions More than 
lOQ tests of hepatic functions have been 
based on the hundreds of reactions that 
have been shown to occur in the liver 
Many of these have been abandoned after 
earlj study A few have been found to be 
cUmcaily useful In Table ll-l is shown a 
classification of the types of functions per 
formed by the liver and of the types of 


tests that have been based on these func 
tions 

Classic experiments in hepatic phjsi 
ology have shown that removal of large 
portions of the liver of normal animals 
may leave some types of hepatic function 
unimpaired This has Jed many authors to 
emphasize the great reserve power of the

patic function The relevance of such e\ 
perlments to clinical problems however, 
may be questioned Diffuse though mild 
disease, such as viral hepatitis or early 
cirrhosis of tlie liver produces impairment 
of many tests of hepatic function with the 
seierity of disease reflected in the degree 
of hepatic dysfunction Disturbed hepatic 
function does not necessarily mean hepatic 
disease, since some nonhepatic diseases 
also may produce impairment of liver func 
Uon Nevertheless the occurrence of abnor 
mal hepatic function can usually be found 
to have a rational basis when considered tn 
the light of the clinical problem 
No one test of liver function is sulBaent 


for clinical analysis of most problems From 
the many tests that have been devised, a 
group of procedures that are most appli 
cable to the particular clinical problem 
should be selected In the following pages 
the physiologic basis for hepatic function 
testing is discussed a number of mdividual 
tests of liver function are analysed, the 
batteries of tests that are considered useful 
are presented and the results in various

hepatic disease Bilirubin is a product of 
hemoglobin from which it is formed in the 
cells of the reticuloendothelial system Here 
the protoporphyrin is separated from the 
Iron and globin portions of the molecule 
and the ring is opened to form bilirubin 
(Fig H-l) The bilirubin is transported 
through the blood (loosely attached to al 
bumin) to the liver In the liver bilirubin 
is conjugated wth glucuronic acid* to form 
the diglucutonide (Fig 11-2), which is 
excreted by the liver into the duodenum 
In the intestines bacterial enzyme action 
converts bilirubin, through a group of m 
termediate compounds, to several related 
compounds collectively referred to as ’uro 
bilinogen” (Fig 11-1) A portion (esU 
mated to be as high as 50 per cent) of 
the "urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the 
blood and re excreted by the liver Nor- 
mally small amounts (1 to 4 mg per 24 
hr ) are excreted in the urine When the 
Watson ‘two hour method’ (see appendix 
to this chapter) is used, normal individuals 
haie less than 1 Ehrlich unit per two hour 
specimen Fecal urobilinogen leiels in nor- 
mals range from 50 to 250 m e per day or 
300 Ehrlich units per 100 gm The metab- 
olism of bilirubin is summarized in Fig 

n-1.

Determination of the le\cl of serum bili- 
rubin was first performed b> \an den Bcrgh 
and Muller, who found that blhrubin m 
normal serum reacted inlh ihe Ehrlich 
v^iazo reagent (dJazotized sulfanibc acid) 
only ivhen alcohol was added Their ob 
scrvation that bile pigment in human bile 
reacted with the diazo reagent ivithout the 
addition of alcohol led to the recognition 
that some change in bilirubin had been 
effected by the liver Van den Bcrgh called 
the form of bilirubin that reacted with the 
diazo reagent without the addition of al 
cohol "direct" and the variety that reacted 
only in the presence of alcohol "indirect ’ 
Serum from patients with jaundice owing 
to excessive hemolysis gave the IndlRct 
reaction, while in the serum of puicnts 
with jaundice owing to obstruction of tlic 
biliary tree the increased serum •bilirubin 
levels gave the "direct reaction ‘The re 
sponse of the serum to the van den Bcrgli 
test has been the basis for several cHssi 
fications of jaundice The physiochcmical 
reasons for the di/Terent types of response 
have been clarified only during tlic past 
several years 

The properties of indirect and of direct 
bilirubin and several of the theories to 
explain these differences arc summarized

passage through the hepatic parenchymal 
cell but had been “regurgitated" into the 
blood Hepatocellular jaundice has been 
considered to ha\e an important element 
of retention as well as of regurgitation 

The classification of Ducci retains the 
categories of JlcNee and the principles of 
the Rich classification It is based on the 
presumed site of the physiologic or ana 
tomic abnormality The categories are pre- 
hepatic hepatic and posthepatic jaundice

similar to the “toxic and infectious cate

tocanalicular jaundice is the vanety of

according to the type of van den Bergh 
reaction as “indirect" or “direct" has been 
replaced by quantitative determination of 
the amount of “direct" and of total bill 
rubin the difference being presumed to 
represent “indirect" bilirubin A commonly 
used method that of Malloy and Evelyn 
(1937), has been replaced in many lab- 
oratories by the modification of Ducci and 
Watson (1945) In this method the amount 
of biUtubtn that has reacted with the diazo 
reagent at the end of one minute is deter 
mined This “one minute" bilirubin pre 
suinablv represents the “prompt direct 
reacting" bihrubin of van den Bergh The 
total bilirubin is measured 15 romutes after 
the addition of methyl alcohol The differ 
ence between the total and one*mmute biU 
rubin values is the "indirect” bihrubin 
The level of bilirubin jn the serum of 
normals in our laboratory is less than 1 
mg per 300 ml This is almost entirely 
uncDDjugated bihrubin In some labora 
tones the normal upper hmn is reported to 
be as high as 1 5 mg The upper limit of 
noimal for conjugated bilirubin vanes 
from 0 2 to 0 4 mg in dilTerent labora

ease This type of iaundice Is seen most 
commonly with certain drug reactions 
(chlorpromazine, organic arsenlcals, methyl-

sionally as a result of \iral hepatitis or it 
may be “idiopathic" 

Tests 

Determination of the total serum bib- 
nibm le%el is useful in measuring the depth 
and progress of jaundice Determination of 
the direct and indirect fraction has been 
of some value in the differential diagnosis 
of jaundice_,\Vhen the direct fraction is 
less than 15 per cent of the total biltrubm 
value, the jaundice is very likely to be 
retention (prehepatlc jaundice type — 
either owng to hemolysis or to constitu 
tional hepatic dysfunction (Table 11-4) 
Little specific aid m the distinction of 
hepatic from posthepatic jaimdice can be 
obtamed from the relative levels of direct 
and indirect biltrubm The direct fraction 
may constitute more than 50 per cent of 
the total bihrubin in either hepatic or 
posthepatic jaundice Levels of the direct 
fraction that constitute between 15 and 50 


per cent of the total bilirubin are infrequent 
m posthepatic jaundice and are more char 
acteristic of hepatic jaundice Attempts to 
define the level of monoglucuronide and of 
diglucuronide. while of interest, have not 
proved of specific differential diagnostic 
value 

Testing for urine bihrubin (unne ‘bile’) 
is useful in the differential diagnosis of 
jaundice The presence of bilirubm in the 
unne shows that the jaundice is of the 
regurgitation type, j e , hepatic or post 
hepatic Bihrubin may also be present in 
the urme of patients without jaundice as 
in early or amctenc hepatitis in metastatic 
carcinoma or in early obstruction of the 
bihary tree 

Decreased 'fecal uTohiUnogen is charac 
tenstic of obstructive (posthepatic) jaun 
dice but may also be found m patients with 
hcpatoceiluiar jaundice An extremely low 
level (l^low 5 mg or 5 Ehrlich units per 
day) of stool urobilinogen is strong evidence 
that the jaundice is posthepauc An m 
creased level of fecal urobihnogen (above 
250 mg or 300 Ehrhch units per day) is 
evidence of hemoljsis When fecal uro- 
bilinogen levels are being determined as

measures of hemolysis they should be corre 
laied wth the degree of anemia (see chap 
ter on hematology) 

JUnne urobilinogen levels are decreased 
in posthepauc jaundice and in some phases 
of hepatic jaundice Increased levels are 
observed usually in hemolytic jaundice and 
with subsiding hepatitis Increased let els 
also may be a sensitite measure of hepatic 
damage even in the absence of jaundice 
as in some patients with cirrhosis of the 
liver metastatic carcinoma or congestive 
heart failure 

Studies of unne and stool pigments are 
extremely useful to the clinician but there 
are several pitfalls in the application of 
bile pigment study to the analysis of jaun 
dice Very low levels of urobilinogen in the 
stool are characteristic of obstructive jaun 
dice but may also occur in patients wHo 
have received “broad spectrum” antibiotics 
These agents suppress the intestinal bac 
teria which convert bilirubin to urobibn 
ogen On the other hand normal levels of 


stool urobilinogen and even increased levels 
of urine urobilinogen may be found in pa 
tients with incomplete obstructive jaun 
dice Dunng the course of viral hepatitis 
(Fig 11-4) urobilinogen and bilirubin 
content of the unne may be characteristic 
of hepatocellular jaundice (phases a and 
c) and of obstructive jaundice (phase b) 
and may even simulate hemolytic icterus 
(phase d) Hemolytic icterus may be com 
pheated by hepatic necrosis (as in sickle 
cell anemia) and thus by hepatocellular 
jaundice or by pigment stones obstnictmg 
the common duct and producing post 
hepatic jaundice 

Other tests based on bilirubin metabolism 
have been devised The bilinibm tolerance 
test consists of administering a known 
amount of bilirubin and observing the rate 
of disappearance from the hloo^This test 
IS a sensitive measure of hepatic function 
but has not been adopted widely because it 
is laborious and expensive The urobiU 
nogen tolerance test consists of the 
measurement of unne urobilinogen excre 
tion after the intravenous admimstration 
of stercobibn This test is also too com 
plicated for general use 

METAhOLIC TESTS 

A number of hepatic function tests have 
been based on the role of the liver in car 
bohydrate protein and fat metabolism 
Those tests related to carbohydrate metabo 
hsm have been least useful and those ro- 
lated to protein metabolism most useful 
Only one commonly used test of hepatic 
funcuon relates to hpid metabolism 

Carbohydrate Metabolism 

Patients with hepatic disease may have 
hypoglycemia dimimshed tolerance for ad 
ministered glucose galactose fructose or 
lactate and decreased hepatic glycogen 
stores the last being measured by the 
blood sugar response to adraimstered epi 
nephxme or glucagon 

Hgpoglycerma occurs regularly in hepa 
tectomized animals occasionally in patients 
with acute hepatic necrosis but rarely in 
patients with chronic liver disease It has 
been desenbed in biliary cirrhosis In pn 
mary or metastatic carcinoma of the liver 
and m the hepatic congesuon of heart fail 
ure The incidence of hypoglycemia in 
hepatic disease however is low 

Glucose tolerance is characteristically 
abnormal in patients with cirrhosis of the 



Tests of Hepatic Function 529 


hver There is a rapid nse of the blood 
sugar %alue to abnormal levels and a slow 
return to normal This pattern in patients 
with bver disease can be distinguished from 
that of diabetes mellitus by the normal or 
low fastmg blood sugar in liver disease and 
the occurrence of subnormal values by the 
fifth hour after the glucose has been ^\en 
Although the oral or intratenous glucose 
tolerance test is of interest in the study 
of patients ivitb hepatic disease, it is of 
little specific value in diagnosis in these 
patients 

.'The galactose tolerance test has been 
applied to the study of liver disease for 
many years The normal liver is able to 
convert galactose to glucose, which is 
stored as glycogen In patients with hepatic 
disease this ability is defective Administra- 
tion of galactose results in persistence of 
abnormal blood levels for several hours and 
in urinary excretion of abnormal amounts 
of galactose This test yields abnormal 
results in patients with hepatocellular jaun- 
dice but normal results in patients with 
obstructive jaundice of brief duration (less 
than three weeks) Accordingly it has been 
advocated by some workers for the dif- 
ferential diagnosis of jaundice, but it is 
not widely used 

The fructose tolerance test, based on a 
pnndple similar to that of galactose toler 
ance, has found no clinical appbcation 
Elevated blood levels of lacuc acid have 
been described in patients with severe hvet 
disease This observation and a lactic actd 
tolerance test have been described as tests 
of hepatic function but also have not been 
applied extensively to cUmcal problems 
/•The epinephrine tolerance test is used to 
estimate hepatic glycogen stores by ob- 
serving the blood sugar response to a 
standard dose of epmephruie Normal tndi 
viduals show a blood sugar rise of 40 to 60 
mg per 100 ml within one hour after the 
epinephrine has been given Patients -mth 
hepatic disease (cirrhosis hepatitis) and 
patients with genetic deficiency in gly 
cogenolytic enzymes (glycogen storage dis 
ease) show a subnormal response The test 
has not been apphed vvndely to the diag 
nosis of bver disease but has been useful 
in clinical research and for the diagnosis 
of gl> cogen storage disease The glucagon 
tolerance test, a recent modification of this 
test, has involved the use of glucagon, 
instead of or combined with epineph^e, 
to produce glycogenolysis In either epin- 
ephrine or glucagon tolerance tests the sub- 


ject should receive a high-carbohydrate diet 
for three days before the test 

Lipid Metabolism 

The bver is importantly involved in manv 
phases of bpid metabobsm, including the 
synthesis, esterification and excreuon of 
cholesterol Only the determination of the 
free and estenfied'd/iofesteroi levels of the 
serum has been appbed intensivelj to the 
study of hepatic disease In normal indi 
viduals (in the Umted States) the serum 
cholesterol level ranges between 150 and 
250 mg per 100 ml with approximate!) 
TtTper cent (100 to 170 mg per 100 ml ) 
estenfied In general the cholesterol level 
IS normal or depressed m hepatocellular 
jaundice and rfevated m obstructive jaun 
dice In patients with hepatitis the total 
cbolesteroi level may be mildly depressed 
or normal, but the level of esterified 
cholesterol is usuaUy moderately decreased 
In severe hepatitis or cirrhosis the serum 
cholesterol (total and estenfied) levels may 
be markedly depressed In patients with 
obstructive jaundice“me blood cholesterol 
level IS usually elevated to levels of 250 to 
500 mg per 100 ml Greater elevations 
ocoif occasionally but are more character 
istic of so-called "intrahepatic obstruction” 
("cbolangiohlic hepatitis” and “primary 
bibary cirrhosis’ ) In T’nmarj biliary ar- 
rhosis” levels up to 1800 mg per 100 ml 
may be observed It is generally stated that 
patients with obstructive jaundice usual!) 
have a normal ( 2 ^) cholesterol-ester/total 
cholesterol ratio Strictly speaking, this is 
not true Although the degree of depression 
of the ratio is characteristically less than 
that seen in hepatic disease, moderate de- 
grees are regularly seen Determination of 
the cholesterol level is widely used in thc' 
diagnosis of hepatic disease Tcchnicall) 
the procedure is somewhat difficult and 
involves meuculous care and technique 
Hypocholesterolemia occurs not only In 
hepatic disease but also in hypcrthjroidisni. 
in the malabsorption s>ndrome, and in 
other states of hyponutriuon 

Bile acids are formed from cholesterol 
in the bver NormaUy they include dlh>- 
droxy and iribydrox) "chohe acids” and 
are excreted as conjugates of gljclne 
(glfcocholic acid) and taurine (taurocholic 
aad) The simple and quabtatlvc methods

tests) have shown Increased blood and

obstrucme jaundice The lack of satis 
factory quantitation and the demonstration 
that bile acids may also be found in the 
unne of patients ivith hepatocellular jaun 
dice prevented the climcal application of 
these procedures Quanfitative methods 
have been applied recently to the study of 
patients with hepatobiliary disease and 
characteristic patterns have been found 
They may prove to have climcal apphca 
tion 

The cinnamic acid tolerance test is an 
interesting test of hepatic function that 
couples two reactions knowm to occur m 
the liver These are fatty acid oxidation 
and conjugauon The normal liver oxidizes 
(beta oxidation) cinnamic acid to benzoic 
acid winch m turn is conjugated with 
glycme to form hippunc acid Abnormal 
hepatic function is reflected in the de- 
creased excretion of hippunc aad This 
test has found Uttle chnical application 

Proletn Metabolism 

Ammo acid metabobsm urea synthesis 
and protein metabolism occur m tbe liver 
Evidence of defects in each of these areas 
ma> be observed in patients with hepatic 
disease These include abnormal plasma 
levels of ammo acids protems urea and 
ammoma and abnormal unne levels of 
ammo acids Several measures of hepauc 
function have been based on these 
phenomena 

y Serum Protein Levels A number of 
plasma protems are formed m tbe liver 
These mclude albumin fibrmogen and 
some of the alpha and beta globulins Ac 
coidmgly changes m the plasma (or scrum) 
protems form the basis for important 
laboratory aids to the diagnosis of hepatic 
disease Depression of serum albumin is 
characteristic of chronic hepatic disease 
For reasons that ^re not clear the serum 
/globulin level is often elevated m patients 
with chrome hepatic disease (cirrhosis) 
The procedures used to evaluate serum 
protein changes in patients with liver dis 
ease include determination of serum al 
bumm and globulin levels serum electro- 
phoresis and several tuibidometric (“floe 
culauon”) tests The turbidomelnc tests 
reflect largely changes of the gamma 
globuUn and albumm levels 

-The serum albumm level is considered 
a rehable index of seventy and prognosis 
in patients with chrome hepatic diwase 
In patients with cirrhosis there is a positive 
correlation between the degree of hypoal 


faununemia and the seventy of the ascites 
Patients who show a nse of the albumin 
level have a more favorable prognosis than 
those whose levels remam low In patients 
with acute hepatic disease ( viral or toxic 
^epajitis) serum albumin levels are usually 
normal or only mildly depressed Those 
who develop subacute hepatic necrosis 
(“subacute yellow atrophy") frequently 
have moderate to marked hypoalbuminemia 
The total serum globulin level is often 
elevated in patients with cirrhosis The 
degree of elevation is usually moderate in 
Laennec s and in biliary cirrhosis with 
levels of 3 to 5 gm per 100 ml In post 
necrotic cirrhosis elevations also may be 
moderate but at times are marked with 
values m the range of 6 to 9 gm per 100 
ml occasionally observed Levels in pa 
tients with acute hepatitis are usu^ly 
normal or only mildly elevated but in 
occasional patients may exceed levels of 
4 gm per 100 ml In patients with ob- 
structive jaundice the globulin level is 
usually normal 

v^erum electrophoresis (see sccnon on 
cbmcal chemistry) is useful to demonstrate 
the globulin fraction elev ated In La enn«s 
and postnecrobc ci rrhosi s It reveals that 
the hy^rgl obulin emi a represents largely 
gamma globulin elevauon In biliary cir 
rbosis the alpha 2 beta and gamma frac

usually normal but the alpha 2 and beta 
fracoons are increased The serum protein

•'^occulation Tests A large number of 
tests have been developed which reflect 
abnormabty of plasma proteins. These 
reactions which have been called the

or tests of tbe “serum colloidal stability” 
have been very useful to the clinician In

These tests have in common the tendency 
to be abnormal in patients with intrinsic 
hepatic disease (hepatitis cirrhosis) and 
to bo normal In patients with obstrucuve 
jaundice Indeed scrum from patients with 
obstructhe jaundice has the property of 
inhibiting the flocculation or turbidity tests 
when mixed with serum that gives a posi 
tive reaction The responsible factor for 
this inhibition may be a phospholipid In 
patients with \ arious systemic tUscases 
charactcnzcd by hyperglobulinemia (T'lble 
11-7), the flocculation tests also may yield 
abnormal results The vanous tests differ 
in the relative incidence of abnormahiy in 
various diseases Of greatest application 
and interest (in the United States) are the 
ccphalm-cholestcrol flocculation and thymol 
turbidity tests In the European literature 
there arc more references to the use of 
other flocculation tests 

The cepfiaiin-cholesterol flocculation test 
Is based on the observation that diluted 
hypergiobuUncmic sc y.i ^ dded to an emul 
Sion of ccphalm-cbolesterol leads to the 
flocculation and precipitation of the 
ccphalin-cholcstcrol with globulin The test 
is positive in approximately 90 per cent of 
patients with hepatitis and In approximately 
60 per cent of patients with cirrhosis (Fig

tion of the serum mucoprotein level has 
been introduced recently into the study of

observed that patients with intrinsic hepatic

or elevated serum mucoprotein levels, tins

Ammo aetduna It has been knowm for 
a long time that patients with acute hepatic 
necrosis (“acute yellow atrophy**) have 
leucine and tyrosine crystals in the urine 
These ammo acids represent, at least m 
part, products of autolyzed hepatic ussue 
Other ammo acids are found in the urine 
of patients with severe cirrhosis or hepatitis 
(toxic or viral) This amino aciduria re 
fleets the elevated levels of blood amino 
acids that result from impaired ammo acid 
metabolism by the liver as well as from the 
release from necrotic tissue already dc 
senbed 

These observations may be applied to

Figure 11 ~ 7 . Pictorial representation of intestinal formation of ammonia in normal and cirrhoDc in- 
dividuals and of the role of the normal liver in removine ammonia brought to It by the portal blood. Fig- 
ure also shows the production of elevated plasma ammonia levels by "shunting" of blood through the col- 
lateral cUculation or by impaired hepatic parenchymal function 


ammonia and liver disease has been recog- 
nized for the past 30 years and suspected 
for the past 60 years. It is uncertain whether 
ammonia, as measured In the blood, rep- 
resents this substance as such or ammonia 
released from some bound state by chemical 
manipulation. At any rate the amount of 
ammonia released from blood or plasma 
by treatment with alkali has been shown 
to be relatable to the severity of the liver 
disease. 

The two chief methods that are available 
for ammonia determination are the micro- 
diffusion method of Conway (1950), in 
which plasma or blood is used, and the sim- 
pler method of Seligson (1951), using whole 
blood. By the method of Conway normal 
indivlduds have plasma ammonia levels 
under 100 mlcrograms per 100 ml. (in our 
laboratory). By the method of Seligson, as 
modified by Bessman (1959), the levels 
are under 100 micrograms per 100 ml. of 
whole blood. 

Studies have shown conclusively that 
the major source of blood ammonia is the 
gastrointestinal tract, although a minor con- 
tribution is made by the kidney. Bacteria, 
particularly those in the area of the cecum, 
release ammonia from nitrogen-containing 
foods. This ammonia, as well as ammonia 
ingested as ammonium salts or released 
from urea by urea-splitting organisms, is 
absorbed into the portal vein. The liver 
normally removes most of the ammonia 
from the portal vein blood, converting ft to 


urea. Little ammonia escapes from the liver 
into the hepatic vein to be carried to the 
systemic circulation. 

Elevated blood ammonia levels in patients 
with hepatic disease appear to depend on 
two mechanisms, “shunting" of portal 
blood past the liver and impaired par- 
enchymal function (Fig. 11-7). In patients 
with cirrhosis and extensive collateral 
portal circulation elevation of the ammonia 
levels has been ascribed largely to the 
shunting of portal blood past Ae liver. 
Hepatic vein catheterization studies have 
shown that patients with severe hepatitis or 
cirrhosis remove less than normal amounts 
of ammonia from the portal blood, perhaps 
as a manifestation of defective urea synthe- 
sis. 

•/Elevated ammonia levels are seen m 
impending or fully developed hepatic 
coma owing to cirrhosis or severe hepatitis 
and occasionally in severe heart failure, 
azotemia, cor pulmonale, and erythroblas- 
tosis fetalis. Also they have been desenbed 
in animals and in one human with an Eck 
fistula and in animals in shock. 

The use of the blood ammonia determina- 
tion has been of assistance in the recogni- 
tion of impending or established hepatic 
coma. As much or more, hoivever, can be 
learned by proper clinical appraisal of the 
patient or by use of electroencephalography. 
Blood ammonia determination may be use- 
ful for monitoring the efficacy of treatment 
of hepatic coma. An additional application 



Tests of Hepatic Function 


has been suggested recently. In patients 
with cirrhosis and hemorrhage from esoph- 
ageal varices blood ammonia levels are 
elevated, tvhereas in noncirrhotic patients 
^viih gastrointestinal bleeding owing lo 
duodenal ulcer the ammonia levels are 
usually normal. Combining the ammonia 
level with the determination of brom- 
sulphthalein excretion is of assistance in 
recognizing gastrointestinal bleeding in 
cirrhotic patients. Measuring the plasma 
ammonia level after a standard 'dose of an 
ammonium salt has been recommended as 
an aid in estimating the patency of a 
portocaval “shunt.” 

/rOREIGN SXmSTANCE EXCRETION 

It has been knotvn for many years that 
certain dyes are removed from the circula- 
tion and excreted almost entirely by the 
liver. The dyes that have been studied in- 
clude azorubin S, rose bengal, phenol- 
tetrachlorphthalein. phenoltetraiodophtha- 
lein, and sodium phenoltetrabromphthaleln 
sulfonate (bromsulfalein, sulfobromphtha* 
lein). Several tests of liver function have 
been based on this principle. Of these the 
two most popular have been the rose bengal 
and sulfobromphthaleln (BSP) excretion 
tests. 

'^Rose Bengal Excretion 

Rose bengal excretion is the first test of 
liver function, based on the elimination of 
dyes by the liver, that received significant 
clinical application. In this test the dye is 
administered parenterally, and either ex- 
cretion of the dye into the duodenum or 
retention in the blood is measured. For tech- 
nical reasons this procedure has been con- 
sidered inferior to the bromsulfalein test 
and abandoned. Rose bengal excretion has 
been recently revived with the introduction 
of rose bengal "tagged” with 1*’*. When 
this substance is given, the rate of pref- 
erential accumulation of the radioactivity 
over the liver and its rate of disappearance 
from the liver have been used to help de- 
tect hepatic disease. This test has been 
Introduced too recently to adequately 
appraise its clinical usefulness, although it 
has been suggested as a means of distin- 
guishing posthepatic from hepatic jaundice. 

-/'SulfobroinpfitltaMn (BSP) J!r.vcrc//<7« 

The BSP excretion test is one of the most 
^vid^y used measures of hepatic function. It 


535 

is also the most sensitive test of liver func- 
tion. Normal results with this procedure 
can, for practical purposes, be considered 
to exclude active parencbj-mal hepatic dis- 
ease. 

Dye Is administered intravenously and 
the completeness of disappearance from the 
blood is determined. The BSP is almost 
completely cleared from the blood by the 
normal liver. (In hepatectomized animals 
less than 20 per cent of the dye may be 
removed by e.xtrahepatic tissue.) It appears 
to be transferred from the blood to the 
parenchymal cell, temporarily stored, and 
e.xcreied as a metabolite or conjugate into 
the bile. The two factors involved in BSP 
excretion by the liver are normal paren- 
chymal cell function and an adequate 
hepatic circulation. 

Several standardized tests have been 
based on the ability of the liver to remoie 
BSP from the blood. In the most widely 
used procedure a dose of 5 mg. per kg. of 
body weight is administered intravenously. 
and*a blood specimen is obtained 45 mil. 
utes later. (In the original method, the 
dose of BSP was 2 mg. per kg., and the 
specimen was drawn at 30 minutes.) The 
dye level at 45 minutes is expressed as the 
per cent of dye "retained ” i.c., not excreted. 
A level of 10 mg. per 100 ml. is considered 
to represent 100 per cent retention (see 
appendix to this chapter for details). 

Normal individuals have less than 5 
per cent retention at 45 minutes. Abnormal 
degrees of reiention occur in patients with 
obstructive or hepatocellular jaundice. It 
is therefore of little diagnostic value to 
perform the BSP excretion test in patients 
wltli jaundice that may be cither hepato- 
cellular or obstructive. It is our practice to 
perform BSP excretion in such patients only 
when the bilirubin level is below 4 mg, per 
100 ml. Although there is evidence that 
in hepatocellular jaundice the BSP reten- 
tion at any particular degree of hyperbili- 
rubinemia is greater than in obstructive 
jaundice, this is of no value in the dif- 
ferential diagnosis of jaundice. The estima- 
tion of the amount of BSP retained in the 
blood may be interfered with by the pres- 
ence of bilirubin in excessive amounts if 
the estimation is done by visual colorimetry 
or with a photoelectric colorimeter in which 
specific filters arc used. On the other hand. 

If a spectrophotometer that can establish a 
precise wavelength is used. BSP levels can 
be estimated quite satisfactorily In the 
presence of hyperbilirubinemia. As indi- 
cate previously, this is of little diagnostic

A number of conjugating reactions occur

with glucuronide to convert the indirect

One conjugating mechanism that has 
been applied as a measure of liver function 
IS the synthesis of hippuric acid in the liver 
by the conjugation of benzoic acid with 
giycinc The test consists of administering 
1 standard amount of benzoic acid orally or 
sodium benzoate intravenously and deter 
mlnbig the amount of hippuric acid cx 
creted in a specific period of time The 
ability to synthesize hippuric acid depends 
not only on the conjugating enzyme sys 
terns of the liver but also on the avallabiHij 
of glycine stores in the liver Furthermore 
the hippuric acid formed is measured by its 
concentration in the urine Tills depends 
therefore on renal function which must be 
intact to use hippuric acul excretion as a 
refiectlon of hepatic function The Jiippuric 
acid excretion test devised by Quick (1910) 
which involved an oral dose of benzole 
acid has been applied widely and in some 
centers has been considered a good measure 
of hepatic function Elxcretion of hippuric 
acid after a standard dose of licnzoic add 
has been found to be decreased in patients 


with intrinsic hepatic disease such as cir 
rhosis or severe hepatitis It has been advo

It has been known for a long time that 
patients with severe hepatic disease as well 
as those with obstructive jaundice may have 
coagulation defects It was observed in 
1940 that vitamin K deficiency results in 
hj poprothrombinemia and that vitanmi K 
which is fat soluble requires bile salts, for 
absorption This led to the recognition that 
bleeding tendencies in obstructive jaundict 
could be improved by the parenteral admin 
istration of vitamin K Tlic hypoproUirom 
bincmia of obstructive jaundice then was 
considered to be due to vitamin K defi 
ciency resulting from lack of absorption 
The hypoprothrombinemia of tht patient 
with parenchymatous hepatic disease was 
not restored to normal by parenteral admin 
IsiraUon of vitamin K 

On this basis a test of hepatic function was 
devised Administration of a standard dose 
of vitamin K to a patient with obstructive 
jaundice usually restores prolonged pro- 
thrombin time to normal whereas it fails to 
do so in patients with the hypoprothrombi 
nemia of intrinsic hepatic diseases Tliis 
test has been considered to be of some v aluc 
for the dilTcrcntlal diagnosis of jaundice 
In a patient with deep jaundice the resfora 
tion of an abnormal prothrombin time to 
normal by vitamin K administration may 
be considered good evidence that jaundice 
IS obstructive Lack of improvement of the 
marked prolongation of the prothrombin 
time may be considered good evidence that 
the jaundice Is hepatocellular There arc

Levels below 25 units however may be ob- 
served in patients with obstructive jaundice 
especially when of brief duration or when 
the obstrucuon is Incomplete Biliary ob 
struction resulting from carcinoma produces 
higher values than those observed in pa 
tients With benign lesions producing ob- 
struction One variety of obstructive jaun 
dice with normal alkaline phosphatase lev 
els In the serum is that seen in infants with 
congenital atresia of the cxtrahcpatlc biliary 
tree In these patients the scrum alkaline 
phosphatase level is not elevated unless 
bony lesions of hepatic rickets develop In 
contrast infants with intnhcpatic biliary 
atresia show striking elevations of scrum 
alkaline phosphatase values 

Elevated levels of scrum alkaline phos 
phatase also occur in hepatocellular jaun 
dice Approximately 00 per cent of patients 
with viral hepatitis of vwth toxic hepato- 
cellular jaundice have elevated serum alka 
line phosphatase values Almost all of these 
have values below 15 Bodansky units 
(B U ) Approximately 5 per cent of pa 
tients with hepatocellular jaundice may 
have levels of 15 to 25 units In otherwise 
characteristic viral hepatitis it is nrc to 
have alkaline phosphatase levels above 25 
units In jaundiced patients with higher 
levels posthcpatic jaundice should be con 
sidcred 

Occasional patients with hepatic disease 
may present a laboratory and clinical pic 
tore simulating obstructive jaundice This 
has been called “cholanglolitic hepatitis" 
or “intrahepatic cholestasis" and In some 
instances has been considered to be a vari 
am of hepatitis A similar entity has been 
noted to follow adverse reactions to certain 
agents Such as chlorpromazinc mcthyltes 
lostcione and organic arscnicals Patients 
with cholangioHiic hepatitis have values of

The serum aU-aline phosphatase lexel iv 
of \alue in the differentiation of hepato* 
cellular from obstructue jaundice with set- 
eral qualifications As stated previously, 
IcNcIs m the “obstructive’ jaundice ranye 
may occur in intrinsic hepatic disease, and 
levels in the “hepatocellular” range may be 
seen in patients tvith incomplete bihary ob- 
struction \Vhen taken with other measures 
of ivvet disease and clinical features, u is a 
useful diagnostic aid 

Serum alkaline phosphatase elevation 
may also occur m nonjaundiced paDenis 
with hepatobiliary disease In patients with 
“space-occupying” lesions of the hver, such 
as granulomatous disease, metastatic or pri- 
mary carcinoma of the Iner, Ihet abscess, 
and amyloidosis, the degree of alkaline 
phosphatase elevation may at times be 
striking (50 to 100 BU ) with little or no 
nse m the serum biUrubln values This pat- 
tern of hepatic dysfunction is useful m the 
recognition of these “space-occuppng" le- 
sions. panicularly in the recognition of me- 
tastasis to the liver in patients vvith carci- 
nomatosis 

There is another type of disease associ- 
ated with normal or only sbghtly elevated 


serum bilirubin levels but with distinctly 
increas^ alkahne phosphatase levels This 
IS occlusion of one hepatic duct or incom 
plete occlusion of the common bile or he 
pa«c duct This condition shouid he Xepi in 
mind, particular!) in dealing with patients 
with cholelithiasis who develop this “dis 
sociated” pattern of hepatic dysfunction 
I,evels of alkaline phosphatase in Laen- 
nec’s cirrhosis are usually normal or only 
mildly elevated In postnecrotic cirrhosis 
the levels ate generally somewhat higher 
In biliary cirrhosis elevated levels of alka- 
bne phosphatase are regularly seen In ob- 
structive biliary cirrhosis the elevations are 
modest, usually under 15 B U , except dur- 
ing bouts of ascending cholangitis In pa- 
tients with primary biliary cirrhosis, con 
sidered by many to be a sequel to cholanglo- 
hde hepatitis, alkahne phosphatase levels 
in the range already described for cholangio- 
litic hepatius may be seen 

The basis lot elevated serum levels of 
alkaline phosphatase in patients with he- 
patobiliary disease is obscure Impaired he- 
patic excretion of eniymc formed in bone 
or hver or both has been suggested In- 
creased formation of alkaline phosphatase

Glutamic oxaloacetic transammase (GOT) 
Is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible

all animals studied In man it is found m 
cardiac hepatic skeletal muscle renal and 
cerebral tissue in decreasmg concentrations 
The recognition of the high myocardial con 
tent of this enzyme led to the observation 
in 1953 that patients with acute myocardial 
infarction had elevated levels in the serum 
for a few days after the infarction Shortly 
thereafter studies in several laboratones 
showed high serum levels of this enzyme 
in patients and animals with acute hepatic

Tests of Hepatic ruNcriON 


The activity of this serum enzyme was 
first demonstrated by a chromatographic 
technique which was too iabonous for 
routine use The methods that have been 
used for routine determination hate in 
eluded the spectrophotometnc procedure of 
Karmen (1955) and several simplified color 
imetric procedures (Fig 11 9 and Chapter 
12) Most laboratories express the value in 
“Karmen units " The normal range is 6 to 
40 units per ml of serum 

The range of values of GOT in patients 
with various types of hepatic disease and 
m myocardial infarction is shoivn in Fig 
11—10 Striking elevations (400 to 4000 
umts/ml ) are observed in the serum of 
almost all patients with acute hepatic ne 
crosis (viral hepatitis carbon tetrachloride 
poisoning) Patients with posthepaiic jaun 
dice and cholangiohtic hepatitis have more 
modest elevations (usually less than 300 
umts/ml ) In patients WTth cirrhosis of the 
hver there is a 60 to 70 per cent incidence 
of elevated GOT levels (also below 300 
umts/ml ) 

Approximately half the patients wth 
metastatic carcinoma haie elevated serum 
GOT levels in the same range as patients 
with cirrhosis and posthepatic Jaundice 
Less frequently such moderately elevated 
GOT levels are observed In patients with 
lymphoma and leukemia In 80 per cent of 
patients wth infectious mononucleosis 
moderate (100 to 600 umts) GOT eleta 
lions are observed Patients with myocar 
di^ infarction usually show GOT levels of 
less than 400 umts The inadence and sig 
nificance of GOT elevations in patients with 
this and ocher nonhepatic conditions are 
discussed in Chapter 12 


Pjtumc Transaminase This 
enzyme cataly'zes the reversible transfer of 
an ammo group from glutamic to pyruvic 
acid (Fig 1 1-1 1 ) It also has been found to 
be widely distributed in humans The high 
hepatic content compared to the relatively 
low concentration in myocardial and other 
tissues has led to the application of GPT 
determmation to the study of hepatic dis 
ease 

The methods used for determination of 
this enzyme in the serum are similar to 
those used for GOT assay Both spectro- 
photometric and colonmetric methods have 
been employed The normal range for this 
enzyme in Karmen umts is almost the same 
as ^at for the GOT (6 to 36 uniis/ml ) 

Patients with viral hepatitis and other 
forms of hepatic necrosis show striking cle 
vations of the serum GPT level (1000 to 
4000 units) The incidence of GPT abnor 
mahty m patients with posthepatic jaun 
dice cholangiohtic hepatitis and meta 
static caremoma is approximately the same 
as that of the GOT in these conditions In 
patients with Laennecs cirrhosis of the 
hver the mcidence and degree of GPT eleva 
tion is less than that of GOT increase It has 
been our experience that GPT elevation is 
greater than GOT increase in 75 per cent 
of pauents with viral hepatitis a lower fig 
ure than that reported by De Hitis and his 
associates (1956) The relative elevations of 
GOT and GPT in other diseases are shown in 
Table 11-11 Levels of GPT are normal 
or only minimally elevated in patients with 
myocardial infarction

patients with hepatic disease for more than 
20 years Methods used for its determina

cirrhosis metastatic caranoma and the he 
patic congestion of heart failure and in 
those with amebic hepatitis or abscess In 
patients with acute hepatitis levels of the 
enzyme are lowest at the peak of the dis 
ease and return to normal with recovery 
Accordingly the level of this serum enzyme 
has been considered to be of some value as 
an index of recovery and prognosis In cir 
rhosis \vlth jaundice or ascites cholinester 
ase values are usually depressed while an 
uncomplicated cirrhosis the Jewels are often 
normal It has been reported that persistent 
depression of the cholinesterase level In 
cmhotic patients is a poor prognostic sign 

In pauents with obstructive jaundice se 
rum cholinesterase Ie\els are often normal 
but when the obstruction is prolonged and 
complete and when complicated by ascend 
Ing cholangitis the serum cholinesterase 
level may be low 

The le\el of this enzyme also may be de 
pressed in patients >vith malnutrition acute 
infections anemias myocardial infarction 
and dermatomyositis Since in these pa 
tlents wIUi nonhepatic and with hepatic 
disease depressed serum choUnesterasc lev 
els are obsened when the serum albumin 
level IS below normal, it has been suggested 
that the cholinesterase depression reflects 
impaired hepatic protein synthesis This is 
consistent with the observation that pa 
tienis with the nephrotic syndrome (char 
acterized by an increased rate of albumin 
synthesis but low serum albumin levels) 
may have increased serum cholinesterase 
levels 

SERUM “METALS” 

Abnormal levels of certain metallic sub- 
stances are found In patients with some 
hepatic diseases Elevated serum iron levels

served in patients with hemochromatosis 
and transfusion hemosiderosis and ma> bt 
of aid in diagnosis Acute elevations of sc 
rum iron levels are observed in viral hepa 
Utis and in other patients with acute he 
patic necrosis It has been obsened that 
patients with obstructhe j aundice usually 
have normal serum iroiT levels This has 
led to the application by European and 
South American workers of the scrum iron 
level determination to the differential diag 
nosis of jaundice This application how 
ever, has not been adopted widely in this 
country 

Elevated blood levels of “free” copptr and 
abnormal amounts of tissue cop^r have 
been observed In patients with Wilsons 
disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) 
This delation of “free copper Is assocl 
ated in most patients with this disease 
with decreased levels of ceruloplasmin a 
copper-carrying proiem that is also an en 
zyme (copper oxidase) Diagnosis of Wil 
sons disease is aided by the demonstration 
of increased levels of free copper in Iht 
plasma and unne and of depressed levels 
of ceruloplasmin in the plasma 

Abnormal levels of other metaUic ions of 
the blood have been described in patients 
with chronic hepatic disease Depressed se

patients with “alcoholic cirrhosis " The slg 
Tuhcance of this observation remains to be

IcUnts Index 

This test devised by Meulengracht 
(1932) consists of measuring the intensity 
of the golden yellow color imparted to the 
serum by bilirubin This is done by com 
paring the serum color with the color of 
standard solutions of dichromate One unit 
of icterus Index has been defined as the 
color of a 1 to 10 000 solution of potassium 
dichromate This test has been supplanted 
bj the serum bilirubin determination in 
many laboratories For the details of the 
procedure the texts by Ham (1950) or by 
Hawk Oser and Summerson (1954) may 
be consulted 

Untte litltrubm Tests 

General Comments A number of meth 
ods have been devised for the demonstra 
tion of bilirubin in the unne The foam" 
test is of little value and should not be 
used The methylene blue test is only useful 
as a rapid screening procedure for a large 
number of urines The most sensitive tests 
depend on concentration of bilirubin by ab- 
sorption on precipitated calcium or barium 
chlonde or on talc followed bj its oxidation 


or diaiotization to produce a characteristic 
color reaction Controlled oxidation of bill 
rubin to the green biliverdin has been ac 
comphshed by ferric chlonde In tnchlor 
acetic acid (Fouchets reagent) or ferric 
chloride in a hydrochloric acid (Ober 
meyers reagent) These are superior to the 
methods mvolving progressive oxidation by 
nitnc acid or iodine Several sensitive 
tests involving the diazotization of bih 
Tubin with several modifications of Ehr 
lichs diazo reagent have been devised but 
have been too laborious for practical appli 
cation Related to these is a procedure in 
troduced by Free and Free (1953) and 
widely adopted This simple method in 
volves the concentration of bihrubin on a 
special cellulose asbestos mat with an un 
usual aflinity for the pigment and the de- 
velopment of a color reaction with a 
diazonium salt (p nitrob°nzene diazomum 
p toluene sulfonate) This procedure may 
be performed with a commercially avail 
able “kit Sev eral of the other methods also 
are the basis of commercially produced 
Tuts" for unne bilimbin determination 
Only one method will be desenbed In 
detail (Hamson spot test) 

Method Hamson (1937)

Comments This test is known as the 
“Hamson spot test Modifications of this 
procedure have been devised by Watson and 
Hawkinson (1946) and by Franklin 
(1949) When the procedure is performed 
as just desenbed the filtrate may be used 
for the urine urobilinogen determination to 
be outlined

General Comments The several urine

and iecal pigments, which are coUectivdy 
referred to as urobilinogen, give the same 
quantitative reaction rvith Ehrlich’s alde- 
hyde reagent ( p-dimethylaminobenzalde- 
hyde). This reaction, which results in a 
characteristic cherr>’-red color, sen'cs as the 
basis for the quantitative determination of 
*'urobiIinogen“ in the stool and urine to be 
described. In the stool or urine (after being 
passed) the colorless urobilinogen may be 
oxidized to orange-yellow pigments known 
as urobilin. 

In performing quantitative tests for 24- 
hour urine urobilinogen excretion or for 
fecal urobilinogen content, the urobilin 
formed must first be reduc^ to urobilino- 
gen with the ferrous sulfate and then the 
colorimetric reaction ivith Ehrlich’s alde- 
hyde reagent produced. This method is 
laborious. Many laboratories perform the 
semlquantitative tests for urine urobilino- 
gen devised by Watson and his associates 
and which are to be presented. A ttvo-hour 
urine is collected and the reaction with 
Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent performed di- 
rectly. Since substances other than uro- 
bilinogen account for some of the final color 
development ^vith the Ehrlich’s aldehyde re- 
agent, the results are reported in ‘Ehrlich 
units” rather than in miUigrams of uro- 
bilinogen. The Intensity of the color reac- 
tion may be measured by use of a compara- 
tor block tvith permanent standards pre- 
pared from pontocyl dyes (see following 
section). The same dyes may be used to 
prepare a standard curve for a photoelec- 
tric colorimeter or spectrophotometer. The 
Wallace and Diamond (1925) method for 
urobilinogen (not to be described) also 
depends on the reaction between urobilin- 
ogen and the EhrUch reagent. In this pro- 
cedure Ehrhch’s aldehyde reagent is added 
to various dilutions of urine. The highest 
dilution of urine shelving the characteristic 
cherry-red color is the endpoint. Normals 
have a value of I to 20 or less. 

The Watson method is preferred to the 
Wallace and Diamond method for several 
reasons. The Watson method is more quan- 
titative, expressing the urobilinogen ex- 
cretion per unit of time, namely, a two-hour 
period. The use of saturated sodium ace- 
tate stops the reaction in 15 seconds. This 
minimizes the reaction of other chromogens 
with the Ehrlich reagent. It may be neces- 
sary to remove the bilirubin when it is 
present in the urine in large enough 
amounts to interfere with the urobilinogen 
reaction. This maj' be done by precipitat- 
ing the bilirubin with barium chloride and 
filtering. 


Reagents 

1. Ehrlich’s aldehyde reagent (Wat- 
son modification). Dissohe p-di- 
methylaminobenzaldehyde in a mix- 
ture of 150 ml. of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and 100 ml. of 
distilled water. This solution should 
be stored in a dark bottle. 

2. Saturated solution sodium acetate. 
Dissolve approximately 1000 gm. of 
sodium acetate (NaCdl^O^-SHsO) 
in enough distilled water to give I 
liter of solution. This nu.xture 
should be heated to approximately 
60“ C. On cooling, there should be 
a large excess of crystals 

3. Color standard. Stock soluuon of 
pontocyl dyes for standardization 
includes 95 mg. pontocyl \iolet 
(6R, 150 per cent) and 5 mg pon- 
tocyl carmine 2B (Both dyes can 
be obtained under these designa- 
tions from E I. duPont de Nemours 
and Company, Incorporated, Wil- 
mington, Delaware.) These two 
dyes are dissolved in 1000 ml. of 

0.5 per cent glacial acetic acid. 

Procedure 

1. The patient empties the bladder at 
1 or 2 p.m. and discards the urine. 
He then drinks a glass of water. 
Exactly two hours later the patient 
voids again. 'The entire specimen is 
collected, the volume is measured, 
and an aliquot of the fresh urine is 
promptly tested. If there is a high 
concentration of bilirubm, it should 
be removed by precipitation with an 
equal volume of a 10 per cent solu- 
tion of barium chloride. 

2. Performance of reaction 

a. Unknown tube 

In this tube 2.5 ml. of fresh urine 
and 2.5 ml. of Ehrlich’s aldehyde 
reagent are mixed. Then, wthout 
delay, 5 ml. of saturated sodium 
acetate are added with thorough 
mixing. 

b. Blank tube 

This lube is prepared as is the un- 
known, except that the saturated 
solution of sodium acetate is added 
before the Ehrlich’s aldehyde re- 
agent. 

c. Colorimetric measurement 

1. Tills may be performed in a 
block colorimeter using perma- 
nent standards. The latter may 
be obtained commercially or pre- 
pared. We prefer to perform the 
determination in a photoelectric

patobiliary disease For the study of ane 
mia and hemoglobin metabolism a four 
day stool collection is more reliable 
Nevertheless elevated values (above 300 
Ehrlich units/100 gm of feces) constitute 
presumptive evidence for hemolysis The 
normal range by this method is 50 to 300 
Ehrlich units per 100 gm of feces Levels 
below 10 units are observed in obstructive

Cephahtt Cholesterol Flocctilatton 

IMethocl Hanger (1939) modified by 
Neefe (1946) 

Principle An aqueous emulsified mix 
ture of cholesterol and cephalin obtained 
from sheep brain is added to diluted serum 
Normal serum permits the suspension to 
remain The serum of patients with liver 
disease and at times with other diseases 
associated with abnormal levels of plasma 
proteins shows various degrees of separa 
tion of the emulsion leaving a deposited 
flocculum and a clanBed supernatant Such 
“positive reactions are graded as described 
under “Procedure 

Material Serum 

Reagents 

1 Cephalin*cholesccrol mixture ob- 
tained commercially It contains 
100 mg partially oxidired cepbalin 
and 300 mg cholesterol 

2 Ether USP 

3 Cephahn cholesterol emulsion 

a A "stock” solution is prepared by 
adding 8 ml of ether to the vial 
containing the cephahn cholesterol 
mixture This stock solution is 
stable if kept m the refrigerator 
b The emulsion is prepared by 
adding 1 0 ml stock solution to 35 
ml freshly distilled water at 65® 
C This should be stirred ivell while 
slowly bringing the mixture to a 
boil The volume then should be 
concentrated to 30 ml at low heat 
after which the emulsion is cooled 
and used It must be freshly pre 
pared on the day of use 

Procedure 

J Add 1 0 ml of emulsion 0 2 ml 
of serum and 4 0 ml of normal 
saline solution to a centrifuge tube 
Shake thoroughly stopper and al 
low tube to stand in a dark room 
for 48 hours The result is read by 
inspection at 24 and 48 hours as 
0 1+ 2+ 3+ or 4+ A “4+ re 


action denotes complete floccula 
tion leaving a water-clear super 
natant fluid A "0 result indicates 
the same degree of turbidity as is 
seen in the control tube 
2 A control tube contammg 4 2 ml 
of saline solution and 1 0 ml of 
emulsion should always be pre 
pared at the beginning of the test 
The degree of turbidity In the 
serum bemg tested is compared 
with that of the control Whenever 
possible It is helpful to perform the 
procedure on a known "negathe 
and 4+ serum for comparison 
Comments and Precautions Positive re 
suits may be obtained in patients with 
acute and chrome hepatic disease and also 
in patients tvith extrahepatic diseases ivith 
hjperglobulmemia In most laboratories a 
value of 3+ or 4+ at the 48 hour readmg 
is considered positive while a value of 
0 1+ or 2+ IS considered normal These 
results should be standardized for the in 
dividual laboratory by studying a senes of 
normal sera 

Thymol Tnrbnlity Test 

Method Maclagan (1944) as modified by 
Shank and Hoagland (1946) 

Principle Thymol in barbital buffer at 
low ionic strength added to serum pro- 
duces distinct turbidity in patients nitb 
Iner disease and with a number of other 
diseases causing abnormality of plasma 
proteins The results are expressed in units 
related to an arbitrary standard 
■^I^terIal Serum 

Reagents Thymol buffer Add I 03 gm 
sodium barbital 1 38 gm barbital and 3 
gm crystalline thymol (USP recrystal 
lized) to 500 ml distilled water Heat to 
boding shake and cool Dust the surface 
with powdered thymol and allow the solu 
tion to stand overnight at room tempera 
ture (20 to 25® C ) Shake and filter to 
remove the thymol crystals that have 
formed Annlno (1958) recommends fil 
tenng for a second time after two days of 
refrigerator storage The solution is stored 
in the refngerator and used as needed until 
it becomes cloudy 
Procedure 

1 Into a cuvet an? measured 4 ml 
thymol buffer and 0 1 ml serum the tube 
Is agitated and then allowed to stand for 
30 minutes The degree of turbidity is de- 
termined by measuring the optical density 
at 650 m^i in a standard s^ctrophotom

Clinic \L Diagnosis b\ Laboratory Methods 


eler or by using the equivalent filter in a 
photoelectric colorimeter A cuvet contain 
ing the th>mol buffer is used as the blank 
The result is expressed m arbitrary units 
using a standard banum sulfate solution 
(or colloidal glass suspension) to prepare 
a standard curve The test also may be per 
formed by visual comparison of the tur 
bidity with gelatin standards as described 
by RIachgan (1952) 

2 Preparation of banum sulfate 
standard A suspension of banum sulfate 
is made by diluting 3 0 ml of 0 092 M 
barium chloride to 100 ml with 0 2 N sul 
furic acid at 10 C The particle size of the 
precipitated barium sulfate at this tern 
perature yields a relatively stable suspen 
sion A standard curve may be established 
by preparing 5 unit 10 unit and 20 unit 
turbidity standards The 5 unit standard is 
prepared by adding 0 68 ml of the banum 
sulfate suspension to 2 32 ml of 0 2 N 
sulfunc acid the 10 unit standard is pre 
pared by adding 1 35 ml of the banum 
sulfate suspension to 1 65 ml of 0 2 N sul 
func acid and the 20 unit standard by 
adding 2 70 ml of 2 N sulfunc acid to 
0 30 ml of the banum sulfate suspension 
Since the suspensions become less stable at 
room temperature the cuvets should be 
well shaken before readings are made 
Using a blank of distilled water one can 
obtain a straight line relationship between 
the optical density of various dilutions of 
the banum sulfate standard at 650 m^ 

Precautions and Comments The hyper 
globuhnemic and hepatic diseases m which 
abnormal results arc obtained with this 
procedure have been discussed Serums 
with increased hpid levels ma> yield “false 
positnc turbidity Accordingly postprandiol 
specimens ma> yield higher values than 
those obtained in the fasting state Normal 
values in our laboratory arc less than 4 
units 

Ziiif TurVulily Test 

Method Kunkel (1947) 

Principle Gamma globulin is prccipl 
tated by low concentrations of heavy metals 
The method of Kunkcl depends on the 
capacity of v ery small amounts of zinc sul 
fate in a barbital buffer at low ionic 
strength to produce turbidity when mixed 
with serum The results arc expressed in 
units related to an arbitrary standard 

Material Scrum 

llcigcnts Buffered zinc sulfate solution 
Dissolve 24 mg of zinc sulfate ( 2^504 


7H O) 280 mg of barbital and 210 mg 
of sodium barbital in distilled water and 
dilute to make 1 0 liter of solution 

Procedure Mix 0 1 ml of serum with 
6 0 ml of the buffered zinc sulfate solu 
tion Allow this to stand for 30 minutes and 
then read in a spectrophotometer or photo* 
electric colonmeter at 650 m/t using the 
buffeted zinc sulfate solution as the blank 
The result may be determined from the 
standard banum sulfate described for the 
thymol turbidity determination The normal 
value IS 12 units or less 

Comments and Precautions The pro- 
cedure IS simple to perform and yields an 
estimate of the gamma globulin level of 
fair reliability Turbidity of the serum due 
to high hpid levels may give falsely ele 
vaied values The upper limit of normal is 
12 units 

Sttlfobroml>hthaleiti (nromsulfalein liSP) 
Lxcrelton Test 

Mcihod Rosenthal and White (1925) 
modified by Mateer (1943) and by Selig 
son and his associates (1957) 

Principle A measured amount of BSP 
IS injected intravenously The liver rapidly 
removes the dye and excretes it into the 
bile If liver function is impaired excrc 
tion IS delayed and a larger proportion of 
the dye remains in the serum The dye con 
centratjon in the serum is measured after 
addition of alkali to convert any dye present 
to the colored sodium salt Corrections for 
turbidity and serum color interference are 
made by using a scrum blank 
Maicnal Serum 

Reagents 

2 BSP in solution (50 mg /ml) JS 
used for injection into the patient 
and as a “stock solution from 
which to prepare standard This is 
commercially available in sterile 
ampules 

2 Alkaline buffer pH 10 6 to 10 7 
This is made by dissolving 12 2 
gm of sodium basic phosphate 
Na IlPO, 7H O) 1 77 gm of so 
dium phosphate (NaPOil2HO) 
and 3 20 gm of sodium p toluene 
sulfonate in distilled water and di 
luting to 500 ml The solution 
should be adjusted to a pH of 10 6 
or 10 7 with 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCl 

3 Acid reagent This is prepared by 
dissolving 69 gm of sodium add 
phosphate (NaH PO 4 IH O) in 250 
ml ^stilled water 



TjL5TS OF Hepatic Function 


553 


Procedure 

1 Administration of dje The test is 
best done the patient in the 
fasting state The patient is weighed 
and the quantity of BSP required 
is calculated (A dosage of 5 mg 
per kg is generally accepted The 
test IS described accordingly For 
the method based on 2 mg per kg 
dosage other sources may be con 
suited ) Using the commercially 
aaailable BSP solution which con 
tains 50 mg per ml , the number 
of ml of solution required Is cjual 
to the patients weight (m pounds) 
duided b> 22 This amount of BSP 
solution IS drawn into a sterile sy 
ringe and Injected into an ante 
cubital \cin with extreme care to 
preaent extravasation of dye into 
the surrounding tissue 

2 Obtaining blood specimen Exactly 
45 minutes after the dje is admin 
Istercd a 10 ml sample of blood is 
taken from a vein preferably from 
the opposite arm The syringe used 
to withdraw the blood should be 
dry and should not be the same one 
used to administer the dye After 
the blood has clotted the scrum 
should be removed with care to 
avoid hemolysis 

3 Determination of the amount of 
dye rcmifning in the blood Place 
0 5 ml of scrum in a cuvet and 
add 3 5 ml of alkaline buffer Mix 
gently and read in a photoelectric 
colorimeter or spectrophotometer at 
or near 580 m/i using water as a 
reference Add 0 I ml of acid rc 
agent Mix gently and read again 
The optical density reading repre 
senting the amount of dye ’‘re 
tained“ is the O D obtained with 
the alkaline buffer minus the OD 
With the acid buffer The per cent 
of dye retained” may be read from 
the standard curve to be described 
or may be calculated from the fol 
lowing formula 


Per cent retention = 


O D standard X 
per cent retention standard 


4 Preparation of standard curve 
a Preparation of the BSP standards 
IS based on the assumption that 
there are SO ml of plasma per kg 
of body weight Injection of 5 mg per 


kg would yield therefore a JO mg 
per cent solution of BSP in plasma 
Accordingly JOO per cent dye re 
lenuon would correspond to a 10 mg 
per cent BSP solution In preparing 
the standard curve use the optical 
density of the BSP solution of each 
of the concentrations shown in the 
foUowmg table after treatment as 
described for the serum sample in 
section 3 

b Stock solution (50 mg per ml ) 
IS diluted 1 to 500 with distilled 
water to give a 10 mg per cent solu 
tlon of BSP The standard solutions 
are made by mixing this solution 
with distilled water as follows

Comments and Precautions Care should 
be taken to avoid Injecting the dye into the 
subcutaneous tissue A clean dry syringe 
should be used to withdraw the blood It 
should not be the same syringe used to 
give the dye Blood should be withdrawn 
from a vein other than the one used to 
administer the dye Normal adults retam 
4 per cent or less of the administered dye 
by the method described 


Epinephrtue Tolermxce Test 

The test is designed to measure the ade 
quacy of glycogen stores or of glycogeno 
lytic enzymes It is well as m doing the 
glucose tolerance test to prepare the pa 
tient for this procedure by administering a 
high-carbohydrate diet for three days On 
the day of the test the fasting blood sugar 
level is determined and the patient is given 
an intramuscular dose of 0 01 mg of 
epinephrine per kg of body weight The 
blood sugar level is determined 30 and 60 
nunutes after the epmephnne is adminis 
teied Normal individuals show a rise of 
at least 50 mg per 100 ml by 60 minutes

The addition of alkah to plasma or blood 
releases free ammoma This diH'uses out of

The ammonia is determined by titration 
with alkali to determine the unbound acid 
(method of Conway) or by nesslerrzaiion 
(method of Sehgson and Sebgson) Both 
methods are sensiUie and quite rehable 
The method of Sehgson as modified by 
Bessman is easier to perform and lends 
Itself better to study of multiple samples 
The details of these methods may be oh- 
tamed by consulting the renew by Bessman 
(1959) 

Galactose Tolerance Test 

The ability to utilize galactose as a 
measure of bier function has been tested 
by one of two related techniques The oral 
galactose tolerance consists of admlmster 
ing a large single dose of galactose (40 
gm ) and determining the excretion of 
galactose in the unne during the succeeding 
five hours Normals excrete small amounts 
(less than 2 gm ) Patients with Lver dis 
ease excrete more than 3 gm wnh this pro* 
cedute Abnormally large quantities of 
galactose also may appear in the urine of 
patients with increased intestinal absorp- 
tion (eg in hvperibyroidism) Accord 
ingly an intravenous test has been devised 
In this procedure the blood galactose level 
is determined 75 minutes after intravenous 
dose of galactose has been given Normal 
individuals have less than 5 mg per 100ml 
of the sugar at this time Patients with 
hepatic disease have higher levels A modi 
ficatlon of the intravenous galactose toler 
ance test measuring the galactose clearance 
per minute has been described 

Ilipfturtc And Cxcretioit Tests 

The test measures the ability of the liver 
to conjugate benzoic acid with glycine to 
form hippuric acid A standard dose of 
sodium benzoate is given and the urinary 
excretion of hippuric acid is measured In 
the oral hippuric acid tolerance test 6 gm 
of sodium benzoate in 30 ml of wafer Is 
given orally followed bv 100 ml of wa cr 
The unne passed during the succeeding 
four hours is collected and its hippuric acid 


content determined Normal individuals 
excrete more than 2 5 gm dunng the four 
hour penod In the intravenous hippunc 
acid tolerance test 1 77 gm of sodium 
benzoate in 20 ml of water is injected 
slowly into a v em and 200 ml of water is 
pven orally Normal individuals excrete 
more than 1 gm of hippunc acid in the 
unne dunng the succeeding hour Less than 
2 5 gra excreted in four hours in the oral 
test or less than 1 gm in one hour In the 
intravenous test is seen m patients with 
hepatic disease The hippuric acid content 
of the unne may be determined gravi 
meincally or by titration after concentra 
tion acidification separation and washing 
Other methods of separation of the hippuric 
aad before titration and a chromatographic 
method have been desenbed 


Res{)07ise of Pro//iro7n5i» Time to 
I linmtn A Administration 

This test has been applied to the differ 
ential diagnosis of jaundice Prothrombin 
deficiency may occur as a result of made 
quate absorption of the fat soluble vitamm 
K in obstructive jaundice or because of 
inability of the damaged liver of hepato* 
cellular jaundice to synthesize prothrombin 
The prothrombin time is determined before 
and 24 hours after the administration of 
10 mg of synthetic vitamm K Patients 
wnh obsiTucuve jaundice usually show a 
return of prothrombin time to or almost to 
normal (85 to 100 per cent) Patients with 
hepatocellular jaundice and a prolonged 
prothrombin time usuallv show less or no 
improvement

Serum Enzyme Determinations 
as an Aid to Diagnosis 

By HYMAN J ZIMMERMAN, M D 


Enzjmes organic catalysts that are re 
sponsible for most of the chemical reactions 
of the body are found In all tissues Anal 
ysis of the enzyme actmty of digestive 
juices of \anous tissues and of formed 
dements of the blood has been of value in 
the understanding of normal and abnormal 
physiology Determination of several serum 
enzymes has been applied for several 
decades to the diagnosis of pancreatic di^ 
ease (amylase lipase) hepatic disease 
(alkaline phosphatase) and prostatic 
carcinoma (acid phosphatase) Interest in 
the study of serum enzymes in disease was 
intensiAed b) the demonstration in 1953 
that there was in the serum a transaminase 
the 

assay of which was helpful In the diagnosis 
of cardiac and hepatic disease During the 
past few years a large number of enzymes 
have been demonstrated in the serum 
(Table 12-1) 

Some serum enzyme determinations have 
been so widely applied to clinical problems 
as to be considered routine laboratory pro- 
cedures (Table 12-2 column A) Others 
though clearly shown to reflect vanous dis 
case states arc bemg applied only to in 
vesUgatue problems or are being determined 
as “routine" procedures in relatively few 
hospital laboratoncs (Table 12-2 column 
B) Others need further study to estabhsh 
their clinical applicability (Table 12-2 
column C) 

In the chapter on liver function tests 
the scrum levels of alkaline phosphatase 


the transaminases and cholinesterase are 
discussed with reference to the diagnosis 
of hepatic disease In this chapter the 
enzymes that have been demonstrated in 
the scrum will be considered in a more 
general fashion The principles of the 
methods appbed to enzyTnc assay will be 
discussed followed by an analysis of the 
significance of the enzymes shown in Table 
12-2 column A The analysis of the cn 
zymes in Table J2-2 column B will be 
bnef a few of the other serum enzymes 
will receive comment The diagnostic ap- 
plication of serum enzymes will be con 
sidcred both in the light of present ap- 
plication and of potential usefuJness Bnef 
re/ezemre tnil be r^tade to ibe 

formed elements of the blood and to en 
zymes of other body fluids 


METHODS or MEVSURING 
SERU^f E^Z\ME ACTIV1T\ 

The amount of enzyme present in any 
tissue or body fluid is not measured directly 
It IS inferred from the activity Ic the 
work that the enzyme performs in catalyz 
Ing a chemical reaction Thus v%hen the 
concentration of an enzyme in the «erum 
is discussed the term “concentration” is a 
semantic convenience and should be under 
stood to mean activity The rate of a reac 
lion catalyzed bv an enzyme is directly pro- 
portional to the enzyme concentration

Amyfnsc (Dinstase) 

Amylases are enzymes that hydrolyze 
starch into smaller molecules There are 
tt^o main varieties found m nature alpha 
and beta amylases Only alpha amylase is 
found in mammals This enzyme has been 
found in a number of tissues but its lugh 
content in the pancreas and saliNary glands 
IS of particular climcal interest 
Methods A number of methods have 
been used to determine the serum amylase 
activity These fall into the two following 
categories 

1 The disappearance of starch as meas 
ured by the starch lodme reaction or by the 
decrease in viscosity of the starch solution 

2 The appearance of reducing sugar 
Many of the methods are satisfactory for 

clinical use The measurement by the 
method of Somogyi (1938) of the amount 
of reducing sugar formed is widely used 
Levels in Disease Increased leiels of this 
serum enzyme are observed in acute pan 
creatitis (see Chapter 13) Almost all pa 
uents with this disease have transiently 
(one to three days) elevated levels of 
serum amylase The degree of elevation 
may vary from levels just above the normal 
(pancreatic edema) to stnkmg elevations 
(acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis) A bncf 
period of elevation is so characteristic of 
acute pancreatitis that persistence of in 
creased levels beyond three or four days is 
suggestive evidence that a pancreatic 
pseudocyst has developed 

Mild to moderate elevations in the level

found to be much more prevalent in male 
than in female urine It was soon shown 
that prostatic tissue contains this enzyme 
in high concentration Another acid phos 
phatase distinguishable from that found 
in the prostate, is present in erythrocytes 
and platelets The methods used for de 
fermmawon of aad phosphatase are similar 
to and include the same substrates as those 
used for alXalme phosphatase assay 
Elevated scrum levels of acid phos 
phatase are seen in patients with prostatic 
carcinoma that has metastasized One 
half to thrce<fourths of patients with carci 
noma of the prostate that has extended 
beyond the capsule have elevated acid 
phosphatase levels Patients with prostatic 
carcinoma stiU confined within the capsule 
usually have normal serum levels of this 
enzyme However, patients with benign 
prostatic hypertrophy may have slight ele 
vations of the serum acid phosphatase level 
after vigorous prostatic “massage Since 
other tissues such as crythroc)ics may 
also release acid phosphatase into the 
serum minor elevations of enzyme levels 
may reflect such an origin rather than the 
prostate Accordingly efforts have been 
made to distinguish “prostatic" acid phos 
phatase from enz>mes of crythrocjte and 
other origin The efforts to distinguish 
“prostatic" acid phosphatase from erythro- 
c)ic acid phosphatase have been based on 
the differential effect of various inhibitors 
on enzymes from these two sources (Table 
12-7) Such efforts do not appear to be 
necessary when the apparently specific 
method of Bodansky (beta glycerophosphate 
as substrate) is used (Woodard 1959) 
When the King Armstrong method (phenyl 
phosphate as substrate) is used and

This enzyme is eletated in diseases in

Table 12-8 are also shown the tissues ivith 
the highest GOT concentration and the 
categones of disease that may show ab

with disease o! the Ii\er are discussed In 
Chapter II and In Table 11-14 and Fig 
11—10 of that chapter 
Extensive studies have shown that 92 to 
98 per cent of patients with acute myo- 
cardial infarction have elevated serum GOT 
levels, which are usually four to ten tunes 
the upper limit of normal These develop 
6 to 12 hours after the time of mfarc 
tion. usually returmng to normal by the 
third or fourth day (Fig 12-1) Secondary 
rises can be correlated with other features, 
suggesting extension or recurrence of 
myocardial infarction Expenmental work 
with animals suggests that the degree of 
nse of serum GOT is related to the extent 
of myocardial necrosis This has been dif 
ficult to prove m patients 

In patients with electrocardiographic and 
clinical cnicna of “coronary insufficiency," 
rather than myocardial infarction elevated 
serum GOT levels may occur It is not clear 
whether this represents myocardial necrosis, 
which has not been recogiuzable by other 
means, or “leakage" of the enzyme into the 
serum even without frank myocardial 
necrosis Nevertheless for treatment pur 
poses we have considered such patients to 
have sustained a myocardial infarction 
hldd elevations of the serum GCfT levels 
have been reported in patients with pul- 
monary infarction The incidence has varied 
from 0 to 30 per cent and the elevations 
are slight to moderate Animal studies also 
have yielded inconclusive results on the 
occurrence of elevated serum GOT levels 
in expenmental pulmonary infarction 
In patients with congestive heart failure 
and in those with marked tachycardia mild 
to moderate degrees of GOT elevation may 
occur These have been attributed to the 
hepatic necrosis secondary to hepatic con 
gestion Patients with pericarditis also have 
been reported to have a 50 per cent incl 
dence of moderately elevated GOT levels 
The incidence and mechanism of occurrence 
of elevated enzyme levels In patients vvith

Patients with disease or injury producing 
inflammation or destruction of skeletal 
muscle also may have elevated serum GOT 
levels Patients with progressive muscular 
dystrophy dcrmatomyositis and tnchinosis 
may have elevated levels while those with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis myasthenia

elevated scrum COT levels Gangrene of 
the extremities and surgical or other 
trauma may produce slight GOT elevations 
In patients with cerebrovascular accidents 
serum GOT elc\ations have been incon 
siantly reported 

Elevated scrum GOT levels in paticnfs 
with hepatic disease are discussed In Chap- 
ter 11 In acute pancreatitis both normal 


and elevated levels have been reported It 
has been suggested that obstruction of the 
biliary tree by the edematous pancreas and 
the presence of associated hepatic disease 
or of delirium tremens may contribute to 
the elevated GOT levels in these patients 
s/tjUinmic PvTuvic Tranviminast (GPT) 
This enzyme is also discussed in Chapter 
11 In patients with myocardial infarction 
elevations of the serum levels of GPT are 
slight or absent Heart failure or shock with 
the attendant hepatic necrosis may lead to 
elevated GPT levels The chief application 
of determination of this serum enzyme is 
m the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease 

Glycohlic En ymfs 

A number of enzymes involved in gly 
coivsis have been demonstrated in the 
scrum (Figs 12-2 to 12-8) Several of 
these enzymes were first shown to be Jn tbt 
scrum by Warburg and Christian Those 
authors sugi,estcd that the cxccssh e 
glvcolysis which Warburg had found to be 
characteristic of neoplastic tissue would 
be reflected in increased serum levels of 
the glycolytic enzymes in animals and 
humans beanng tumors \ number of sub 
sequent reports have confrmed their ob- 
servation In patients with extensive cnrcl 
noma elevated levels of several of these 
enzymes (phosphohexosc isomerast aldo- 
lase and lactic dehydrogenase) have been 
observed These elciJilan^ have served as 
a guide to chemotherapy particularly In 
carcinoma of the breast and prostate 

Elevated levels of these enzymes also 
have been observed In patients with megalo-

anemias Aldolase and “isomerase" levels 
are high in patients wth acute viral or 
toxic hepatitis but lactic dehydrogenase 
levels are only slightly to moderately ele 
vated in these patients Other glycolytic 
enzymes (phosphoglucomutase fructose 6 
aldolase) which have been demonstrated 
in the serum require further study for 
clear delmeation of their value as reflections 
of particular disease entities 

Phospholiexose Isomerase (PHI) This 
glycolytic enzyme catalyzes the conversion 
of glucose-6 phosphate to fructose 6-phos 
phate (Figs 12-2 12-4) First studied in 
the serum of tumorous rats by Warburg and 
Christian PHI levels of the serum have 
been Investigated in patients with carci 


noma and other diseases during the past 
few years 

The activity of PHI is assayed by using 
glucose 6 phosphate as substrate The rate 
of formation of fructose 6 phosphate using 
the SeliwanofT reaction (resorcinol) is a 
measure of PHI activity No standard unit 
of activity has been agreed upon although 
several have been suggested 

Phosphohexose isomerase levels have 
been used as an index of mctastases in pa 
tients with carcinoma of the breast and 
prostate and to raomtor the response to 
therapy Other diseases in which elevations 
are observed are hsted in Table 12-1 and

reaction may be measured by followng the

Early reports of elevated levels fn pregnancy 
have not been supported by more recent 
studies 

The pattern of serum L D elevation m

most all patients within a few hours of the 
occurrence of infarction Although the de- 
gree of elevation is not so stnVjng as in 
the case of GOT. the elevated levels persist 
for a longer period (10 to 14 days) (Fig 
12-1) Several authors have emphasized 
the value of LD determination in the 
diagnosis of myocardial infarction Al- 
though the occurrence of elevated levels in 
the other diseases just listed and shown 
in Table 12-1 and Fig 12-6 are of Interest, 
there has been no widespread clinical 
application of serum L D assay 

“Cfinc Acid Cycle” Cnxymes 

Several of tlie enzymes identified in the 
serum have been considered to be citric 
acid cycle enzymes (Figs 12-3, 12-7. 12-8) 
released into the blood Although they are 


shown as such in this discussion, this con 
cept is currently being revised Enzymes 
of the dtne acid cycle are “particulate ” 
being located in the mitochondria, and are 
less likely to enter the blood than the 
“soluble” cytoplasmic enzymes Further 
more the isocitric dehydrogenase (ICD) 
(Fig 12-7) found in the serum requires 
TPN as the coenzyme, vvhile the citric acid 
cycle ICD IS a DPN linked enzyme Mabc 
dehydrogenase activity has been demon 
strated m the cytoplasm and mitochondria 
Fumarase appears to be a imtochondnal 
enzyme 

Isocitnc dehydrogenase (ICD) (Fig 12- 
7) has been reported to be a sensitive 
measure of hepatic disease, being increased 
up to 40 fold in the serum of patients with 
hepatic necrosis but much less elevated or 
normal m patients with obstructive jaundice 
and cirrhosis We have observed distinct 
elevations of the level of this serum enzyme 
in metastatic carcinoma (to hver and per 
haps bone)

Hexose Shunt Lnzymes 

Several of the enzymes of the hexose 
monophosphate shunt have been demon 
strated in the serum Reports have appeared 
on the occurrence of elevated serum levels 
of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 
of 6-phosphoglucoiuc dehydrogenase in 
padents with hepadc disease The chnical 
significance and applicabihty of assay of 
these serum enzymes remam to be estab-

Other 5er«m En-yntes 

Many other enzymes have been demon 
strated m the serum (Table 12-1) These 
are too numerous for individual descnption 
in this discussion but there are a few that 
warrant special mention These include 
ormthme carbamyl transferase an enzyme 
that has been reported to reflect sensidvely 
and specifically hepauc disease plasma 
pepsinogen an enzyme precursor that re 
fleets funcdon and disease of the stomach 
(high levels in padents with pepdc ulcer 
low levels in padents with pernicious 
anemia) ceruloplasmm a copper-carrjing 
protein that is also an enzyme and the 
serum levels of which are depressed in pa 
dents with hepatolendcular degeneration

significance of these enzyme determinations

/possible causes for abnormvl 

LEVELS OF SERUM ENZ\MES 

There are several theoretical mechanisms 
by which serum enzyme levels might be 
increased (Table 12-9) 

Tissues that have normal enzyme content 
may release several of the enzymes upon 
undergomg necrosis or an alteration of 
cell permeabiht) Thus elevadons of serum 
levels of amylase hpase trypsin leucuie 
aimnopeptidase and deoxyribonuclease 
have been reported in patients with acute 
pancreadtis Similarly in hepadtis and in 


myocardial infarction a number of enzymes 
found in the hver and myocardium appear 
to be released into the blood in abnormal 
amounts 

Tissues with increased enzyme concen 
tration also may contnbute to increased 
levels of the respecdve serum enzyme e g 
rapidly growing dssues (carcinoma and 
embiyonic tissue) have an abnormal car 
bobydrate metabolism characterized by an 
increased rate of glycolysis Glycolvuc en 
zymes have been found in increased con 
centration in some neoplasms It has been 
postulated that the high glycolytic acdvity 
of neoplastic tissue is the basis for the 
elevated levels of some of the gljcolyuc 
enzymes (phosphohexose isomerase aldo- 
lase lactic dehydrogenase) 

Impaired excretion may explain eleva 
dons of serum amylase in patients with 
renal failure and of the transaminases in 
patients with obstructive jaundice 

Lower than normal levels of some serum 
enzymes may also be observed presumably 
because of unpaired synthesis Examples of 
this state mclude the depressed serum 
cholinesterase levels that are characteristic 
of chronic hver disease and the depressed 
serum alkaline phosphatase level observed 
m the inborn error of metabobsm entitled 
hypopbosphatasia 

The cluilcal value of serum enzyme de 
teiminauon is summanzed in Table 12-10 
(The section in the chapter on hver func 
uon tests relating to the appbcation of 
serum enzymes in hver disease should be 
read in conjunction wnth this material ) 
There is widespread and routine chnical 
application of determination of serum 
amylase levels in the diagnosis of acute 
pancieatitis of alkalme phosphatase levels 
in the recogmtion of bone and hepatobihary 
disease of acid phosphatase levels in the 
diagnosis of dissemmated prostatic caici 
noma and of GOT levels in the diagnosis 
of cardiac and hepatic disease Of v alue but 
less widely apphed is the determination of 
GPT activity in the recogmOon of hepa 
tobihary disease and of levels of the 
glycolytic enzymes which have a limited 
appbcation to the diagnosis and manage- 
ment of neoplastic disease The results ob- 
tamed with a number of other serum en 
zymes in vanoJS disease states are sum 
marized in Table 12 1 In Table 12 1 1 the 
combinations of enzyme abnormalities that 
may be expected in vanous diseases are 
shown The appbcation of serum enzyme 
activity to clmical problems is bemg studied

be described and the few areas of clinical 
application mentioned 

Erythrocyte Enzymes 

A large number of enz>mes have been 
demonstrated in the mammalian crythro 
cyte Most of the studies related to the 
metabolism and enzymatic machinery of 
the human red blood cell hate been of 
iinestigaliie interest rather than being 
suited to immediate clinical application 
Assay of enzymes related to galactose 
metabolism has been found to be of value 
in the diagnosis of galactosemia and the 
study of one of the liexose shunt" enzymes 
has been shown to be of value m the 
recognition of the genetically determined 
drug induced hemolytic anemias 

Galactosemia is an inborn error of me 
tabollsm characterized by a specific defect 
in the utilization of galactose which results 
in widespread tissue damage The defect 
has been found to be deficiency of the cn 
z>me phosphogalactose uridyl transferase 
file resulting accumulation of galactose 1 
phosphate is considered responsible for the 
development of cataracts liver disease 
renal disease and other abnormalities AI 
though the most important site of the bio 
chemical lesion Is of course the liver, (he 
hereditary enzyme deficiency can be dem 
onstraied by studying the erythrocyte 
Accordingly a clinically feasible test for 
the diagnosis of galactosemia has been 
introduced 

A genetic defect in erythrocyte metabo- 
lism has been found to be responsible for 
an unusual susceptibility to drug induced 
hemolytic anemia in some individuals 
Recognition of this inborn error is facili 
lated by demonstrating the reduced con 
centration of glucose S-pliosphate dehy 
drogenase in the erythrocyte For other 
means of studying this phenomenon the 
publications of Altman (1959) Bculler 
(1959) Marks and Gross (1959) and 
Szemberg Sheba and Adams (1958) 
should be consulted 

Leukocyte Enzymes 

Tlie study of leukocyte enzymes has 
been hampered somewhat by the difficulty 
of freeing leukocytes from contaminating 
platelets Nevertheless histochemical and 
biochemical studies have revealed data of 
interest on the alkaline phosphatase con 
tent as well as the activity of other en 
zymes of the leukocyte The leukocyte 


alkaline phosphatase determination has 
proved of some limited clinical application 
The leukocytes of patients with chronic 
myelocytic leukemia and chrome lympho 
cylic leukemia contain considerably lower 
than normal concentrations of alkabne 
phosphatase while the leukocytes of pa 
tients with nonleukemic leukocytosis and 
myeloproliferative disease have higher than 
normal concentrations of the enzyme 

Plateiet Enzymes 

The enzymatic machinery of the platelet 
has been studied in only a preliminary 
fashion No clinically practical appbcations 
are as yet available 

ENZYME CONCENTRATION IN 
OTHER KODV FLUIDS 

Measurement of enzyme activity in the 
unne serous effusions cerebrospinal fluid 
and gastrointestinal juices has been applied 
to the diagnosis of various diseases 

The application of urine amylase de 
termination to the diagnosis of pancreatic 
disease has been supplanted in most 
laboratories by serum amylase measure 
ment (see Chapter 13) Likewise detetmina 
atlon of urinary pepsinogen levels as a 
diagnostic aid to the recognition of 
pernicious anemia or of peptic ulcer has 
been considered unreliable by many 
workers It has been replaced in some Jabora 
tones by measurement of the plasma 
pepsinogen level 

Determination of the levels of lactic 
dehydrogenase In serous cavity effusions 
has recently been proposed as a method of 
demonstrating neoplastic involvement of 
the serosal surface In such circumstances 
the serous fluid usually shows higher levels 
of L D than does the serum Rarely non 
neoplastic effusions (eg tuberculosis) may 
show this phenomenon The basis for the 
elevated L D is presumably the abnormally 
high glycolytic activity of the neoplasUc 
cells The clinical value of this promising 
diagnostic adjunct remains to be established 
by further studies 

Cerebrospinal fluid enzyme levels are 
relatively independent of the serum levels 
Increased spinal fluid levels of glutamic 
oxaloacetic transaminase lactic dehydro 
genase nbonuclease and glutathione re 
ductase have been described in pauents 
with various diseases of the central nervous 
system The levels of one or more of these 
enzymes are increased in patients with

METHODS 

The prmciples of enzyme assay in 
general and of a number of serum enz>me5 
in particular have been discussed in the 
body of this chapter Details of the methods 
for the assay of the transaminases and 
phosphatases will be descnbed in this sec 
tion Details of the amylase and lipase de 
termination are discussed in Chapter 13

Determination 

Method Bodansky (1933) 

Principle The \artous methods available 
for phosphatase determination depend on 
the measurement of one of the products of 
hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters The 
method of Bodansky depends on the bbeta 
tion of morgamc phosphate from beta 
glycerophosphate Alkaline phosphatase 
activity IS determined by incubating serum 
with the substrate /3 glycerophosphate at 
a pH of 9 0 After incubation the amount 
of morgamc phosphorus liberated is de 
termined by the Fiske Subarrow method 
The degree of activity is expressed in 
Bodansky units One Bodansky unit cor 
responds to the liberation of 1 mg of in 
organic phosphorus per 100 ml serum per 
hour at 37* C Acid phosphatase is de 
termined by the same method but at a pH 
of 5 0 The normal limits are 1 to A units 
for alkaline phosphatase and 1 to 2 units 
for acid phosphatase

G/(ifamir Oxaloacetic Transaminase 

Method Karmen (1955), modiHed by 
Sternberg Baldwin and Ostrow (1956) 
Principle. The reactions imolvcd in this 
assay are shown in Fig 1 1-9 of Chapter 
11 The spectrophotometnc assay is based 
on the transamination of aspartic acid with 
n-ketoglutanc acid to form oxaloacetic and 
glutamic acids, the rate of formation of 
oxaloacetic acid is measured reducing 
It to malic acid by adding exogenous malic 
dehydrogenase and DPNH The rate of this 
reaction is measured by serial determina 
non of the progrcssi\e decrease in concen 
tration of DPNH in an ultraviolet spectro- 
photometer (340 m^) Thu method of 
Karmen original!) described for the Beck- 
man DU spectrophotometer Ins been

incubation permits the oxidation of vanabie 
amounts of DPNH by intrinsic dehydro 
genase actmiy of the serum If the optical 
density of the solution falls below 0 200 at 
the end of this period an additional 0 1 
ml of the DPNH solution should be added 
before step 3 

3 The tubes are then brought to the 
temperature chosen for the assay (25 or 
37* C ), 0 2 ml of a ketoglutarate solution 
is added to each tube and the contents are 
once more thoroughly mixed

the a ketoglutarate solution readings are 
begun with the spectrophotometer set at

read the optical density of the assay tube 
at exactly 2 4, 6, 8, 10. and 12 minutes 
When the GOT activity is low, the readings 
may be earned on for a longer period 
When the GOT activity is so high that the 
DPNH is oxidized too rapidly for accurate 
determination, the serum should be diluted 
1 to 2 or 1 to 4 and so on, as needed

perature may be accomplished by reference 
to a chart pubhshed in the report of Stem

Comments This method is relatively sun 
pie Falsely high values are produced by 
marked hemolysis Falsely low values may 
result from depletion of the DPNH by ex 
cess dehydrogenase activity as indicated by 
a starting optical density of less than 0 200 
Only when the Beckman DU spectrophotom 
eter is used can the optical density change 
be equated ivith units Other spectropho 
tometeis have different light paths and a 
correction must accordingly be introduced 
Before the value can be calculated by the 
formula just shown the linearity of the 
results should be confirmed by inspection 
of the values or by plotting (he results on 
a graph If there is a "lag” in the earlj part 
of the determination or if the curve flat 
tens during the last several readings the 
most linear portion of the cune should be 
selected for analysis (This should be at 
least eight minutes in duration ) Normal 
individuals have less than 40 units per ml 
Serum may be maintained in (he frozen 
state without an appreciable decline in GOT 
activity Even at 5° C the serum value of 
GOT Is maintained for at least four to five 
days 


Glittaimc Pyrtnne Transamitiase 

Method Wroblewski and LaDue (1956) 
as modified in the Technical Bulletin No 
410 of the Sigma Chemical Company 
(1958) 

Principle The reactions involved in this 
assay are shown in Fig 11-10 of Chapter 
11 The spectrophotometnc and colorimet 
nc assays are analogous to those used for 
the GOT determination The spcctropboto- 
metric assay is based on the transamination 
of alanine with a ketoglutanc acid to form 
pyninc acid and glutamic acid The rate of 
formation of pyruvic acid is measured by 
reducing it to lactic acid by adding cx 
ogenous lactic dehydrogenase and DPNH 
The rate of this reaction Is measured by 


serial determination of the progressive de 
crease m concentration of DPNH in an 
ultraviolet spectrophotometer (340 m^) 
The method of Wroblewski and LaDue 
ongmally desenbed for the Beckman DU 
spectrophotometer may be adapted to the 
use of a modified Bausch and Lomb spec 
trophotometer (“Spectromer 20”) in a man 
ner similar to that desenbed for the GOT 
determination A simple colorimetric 
method has been described by Reitman 
and Frankel (1957)

Laboratory Tests Aiding in the 
Diagnosis of Pancreatic 
Disorders 


By NORBERT W TIETZ, PH D 


The pancreas is hidden deeply in the 
retroperitoneal space in the abdomen It is 
almost inaccessible for direct examination 
The value of radiologic examination is also 
limited Hence pancreatic function tests 
and other laboratory tests for diagnosis of 
disorders of this organ are of great im 
portance However none of the available 
laboratory tests have proved to be diagnos 
tic and great care is necessary when in 
terpreting results The value of the tests is 
limited chiefly because the pancreas has a 
large functional reserve (normal secretory 
function may be present even if only a part 
of the organ is functioning provided the 
connection with the pancreatic duct is 
maintamed) The value of laboratory tests 
IS also limited because some of the enzymes 
secreted by the pancreas can also originate 
from other sources because incomplete ob 
structlon caused by tumors or other causes 
may permit normal flow of digestive juices 
into the duodenum without changes in the 
blood enzymes and because increase in 
blood enzymes can result from cxtrapancre 
atlc disorders or the administration of drugs 
In spite of the limitations laboratory tests can 
be of considerable aid to the clinician The 
tests that have been selected are thought 
to be the most useful of those available for 
the diagnosis of pancreatic disorders at the 
present lime Reviews published b> Popper 
and Nechelts (1959) Nechcles and Kir 


shen (1957) and Janowitz and Dreiling 
(1959) can be consulted by those inter 
ested in pursuing the subject further 

ENZYMES 

The normal pancreas secretes a number 
of enzjTnes In some disorders these appear 
1 X 1 the blood in increased amounts or are 
impeded in their flow into the duodenum 
The clinically most important enzymes are 
amylase lipase and trypsin 

Sentm /I my /me 

Amylase hydrolyzes starch glycogen and 
dextrines llie route by which amyhse 
(and lipase) enters Into the general clt 
culation is not known It is believed that 
« onginales in the acinar cells of the pan 
creas and that a part enters the blood di 
rcctly or via the ductules In acute pan 
creatltis or in pancreatic injury pancreatic 
juicc diffuses out of the duct system Into 
interstitial spaces of the gland the meso- 
colon the mesentery and the pentoncil 
cavity This Is thought to be due to changes 
in pressure changes in the permeability of 
acinar cells or disruption of the acinar 
limiting membrane (Janowitz and DrelUng 
1959 Nechcles and Kirshen 1957 Popper 
and Nechcles 1959) The pan'^reaiic fluid 
then enters the blood circulation by means 


57*1 



L\borator-v Ti^ Aiding is Diagnosis of Pancreatic Disorders 579 


of the Ijmphailc channels and especially by 
way of the portal aeln (Janowit? and Drcd 
ing 1959) 

The increase in amylase levels in blood 
depends not only on the release of the cn 
zyme by the acinar cells but also on the 
continued secretion in the presence of ob 
stniction (Lemon and Byrnes 19i9) There 
is evidence that amylase is not absorbed 
normally from the intestinal tract (Jano- 
»vitz and Drciling 1959) After the enzyme 
reaches the blood It is excreted by the kid 
neys It is unlikely that the liver aids in 
its excretion since no amylolytlc activity 
has been found in the bile It follows that 
the amylase level In blood represents the 
difference between the amount of enzyme cn 
tering the circulation and that being cleared 
by the kidneys Since the release of enzyme 
bv the pancreas decreases with progressing 
pancreatic disease while the kidneys con 
tinue their excretion enzyme levels do not 
stay elevated 

For example. In acute pancreatitis ihe 
amylolytie activity usually returns to nor 
mil within one to throe days after the 
onset of the disease For that reason amy 
lasc determination should be done as soon 
as possible Jf it is to be of diagnostic sig 
nlficince Increases in serum amylase In 
acute pancreatitis though significant, may 
be absent Bockui and co>vvorkcrs (1955) 
studied 94 cases and found II cases with 
normal amylase levels (even in patients 
dying from the disease) 42 wuh elevations 
up to 500 units and 41 with values above 
500 units (normal 30 to 160 units) Sim 
ilir liigh values have been observed m ob- 
struction of the pancreatic duct As in acute 
pancreatitis these values decrease after sev 
oral days In tumors of the pancreas in 
crease In serum amylase is rare Although 
high serum amylase levels are usually as 
socialed with acute pancreatitis other con 
dltlons can also cause similar elevations 

Amylisc in Intn abdomiml Dwciscs 
Perforated peptic gastric or duodenal ul 
cers, even if not in direct contact with the 
pancreas may cause elevations of scrum 
amylase Values over lOOD units have been 
reported These elevations seem to be due 
to absorption of amylase from the peri 
loneal cavity In one senes 19 of 35 pa 
ticnts with intestinal obstruction bid amy 
lase values above normal with two cases 
of 1600 and 2000 units Absorption of en 
zymes from capillaries or lymphatics of the 
damaged bowel or from the peritoneum 
after seepage through the intestinal wall is 
thought to be responsible Increased serum 
amylase is sometimes seen after abdominal 


operations This might be caused by minor 
trauma to the blood supply of the pancreas 
or by partial duodenal obstruction with a 
resulting rise in intraductal pressure En 
zyme elevations have even been reported 
after operations far remote from the pan 
creas 

Misccll'incotis Conditions Causing In 
ctense in Scrum Amylase Another cause for 
increased scrum amylase is retention of 
the enzyme owing to renal insufficiency In 
one series of 111 cases 29 had amylase 
levels between 200 and 1000 units Rup 
tured ectopic pregnancy peritonitis ty 
phoid enteritis and acute diseases of the 
salivary glands such as mumps are 
among the other causes for Increased 
scrum amylase Morphine codeine and 
meperidine (Demerol) may cause a tran 
filcni spasm of the duodenal musculature 
and of tJic sphincter of Oddi resulting in 
slight scnim amylase increases Morphine 
sulfate in a dose of 16 mg was found to 
produce slight elevations which do not oc 
cur before five hours but which may per 
sist as long as 24 hours The serum amylase 
values after administration of provocative 
drugs vvll) be discussed in a separate para 
graph 

Low scrum amylase values have been 
found in abscesses of the liver acute 
hepatocellular damage cirrhosis cancer of 
the liver and bile duct and cholecystitis 
Jaundice alone and chronic diseases of the 
gallbladder do not influence amylase levels 
Amylase is usually absent in newborns It 
appears approximately at the age of two 
months and reaches normal levels at the 
end of the first year (Somogyi 1941) 

Urinary Amylase 

Renal clearance of amylase is in the 
range of 1 to 3 ml per minute and is only 
slightly altered fay water induced diuresis 
It appears therefore that amylase is fil 
tered but not reabsorbed and that it has no 
renal threshold (McGeachin and Hargan 
1956) Little else is known about the mech 
anism of amylase e'ccretlon 

Tor some unknown reasons urinary amy 
lase in acute pancreatitis or obstruction of 
the pancreatic duct is sometimes more ele 
vated than is serum amylase and the In 
creased levels may persist over a longer 
period In cases of pancreatic carcinoma 
with obstruction of the pancreatic duct 
urinary amylase levels may also be ele 
vated occasionally 

The method of Wohlgemuth (1908) 
which is usually employed in such studies 



Clinical Diagnosis by Laborators Mftiiods 


580 

IS not so reliable as the Somogyi serum 
amylase test because of the greatly varying 
concentration and composition of the 
urine 

Most increases in serum amylase what 
e\er the cause ivill affect unne amylase in 
the same way Hence the need for cautious 
interpretation of results 


Serum Ltpase 

Serum lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 
fatty acid esters Its main known source is 
the pancreas but it is also produced in the 
mucosa of the stomach In the small intes- 
tine and possibly in other tissues The pan 
creatic portion of the enzyme is produced in 
the acinar cells and reaches the blood in the 
same way as amylase The best substrate for 
hpase determination is neutral fat (tngyl 
cende esters ^vlth long-chain fatty acids) 
However specificity of this enzyme Is only 
relative since it splits esters ranging from 
short-chain fatty acids with monohydroxy 
alcohols up to long chain fatty acid esters 
with glycerin 

In general changes in serum hpase levels 
have the same significance as those of 
amylase However there are differences 
that favor the lipase determination In 
acute pancreatitis elevated levels of this en 
zyme decrease more gradually and can be 
found for as long as 14 days while amylase 
usually returns to normal within one to 
three days Our group studied serum hpase 
levels in 3S cases of proved pancreatitis 
using a modified technique (see p 587) 
According to our results lipase remains ele 
vated longer than amylase and the increase 
IS more pronounced In two cases serum 
amylase was within the normal range but 
lipase was significantly elevated (Tietz 
et al 1959) Serum lipase In contrast to 
amylase is increased in approximately 40 
to 50 per cent of cases of carcinoma of the 
pancreas in about 60 per cent of cases of 
carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater and oc 
casionally in chronic pancreatitis Serum 
hpase levels may be normal in advanced 
disease of the pancreas if no functioning 
pancreatic tissue remains Lipase is normal 
in acute diseases of the salivary glands 


Urinary Ltftase 

Lipase Is excreted by the kidneys and 
can be demonstrated in the urine It has 
been found elevated in hemorrhagic pan 
crealitis and in some cases of renal Jm 
pairmenl 


The determination of Upase in the urine 
presents difficulties because of the pres 
ence of an inhibitor Presently available 
lipase methods are either loo tedious or not 
fully rehable 

Leucine Amino PelAidase 

Leucine ammo peptidase (LAP) Is found 
in amost all human tissues and also in 
serum urine and bile Goldbarg (1958) 
and Rutenburg (1958) developed a method 
for Its assay In serum and urine and found 
significant elevations of this enzyme In 
carcinoma of the pancreas Although such 
elevations were found m all 18 invest! 
gated cases and were confirmed by Perry 
and Gibson (1960) the test seems to have 
only hmiied diagnostic value because ele 
vations have also been reported in obstruc 
live jaundice infectious hepatitis ractas 
tatic cancer acute pancreatitis and preg 
nancy In addition urinary LAP is elevated 
in lymphomas and leukemia and following 
operation Further use of this test will have 
to show whether it might be of value in 
excluding carcinoma of the pancreas 

Trypsin in Stool 

Trypsin a protein splitting enzyme in the 
pancreatic juice was formerly thought to 
be a single enzyme but is now known to 
consist of trypsin chymotrypsm and car 
boxypolypeptidase Trypsin is secreted first 
as an inaciivo precursor trypslnogen and 
then activated in the intestines by entero- 
kinase (or by calcium or bile) The enzyme 
IS excreted in feces and can be demon 
strated there Patients with pancreatic in 
sufficiency usually have little or no tryptic 
activity in the stool (Shwachman and 
Gahm 1949) Stool trypsin determinations 
are of value only in infants and children 
since in adults negative results have been 
seen frequently even m the absence of pan 
creatic disorders 

However these tests are of limited value 
especially because of the possible presence 
of proteolytic bacteria Therefore the test 
can be considered only as a screening pro- 
cedure and a culture for proteolytic bac- 
teria should always be done if the result is 
positive unless a control with antitrypsin is 
run at the same time (sec p 589)

increase In blood enzymes in most indi

Snape and coworkers (1949) studied a num 
ber of controls and patients with -va-nous 
pancreauc diseases by deterroming serum 
amylase In a fasting blood specimen and 
then giving 10 to 15 mg of morplilne sul 
fate, followed after 30 minutes by 1 unit of 
secretin per kg of body weight Further 
amylase studies were done on specimens 
withdrawn 15, 30 60 and 90 minutes after 
secretin In control patients the average 
base level was 133 5 units with on average 
peak level of 389 3 units at 30 to €0 min 
utes Values in patients with pancreatitis 
were significantly higher, and those in pa* 
tients with carcinoma of the pancreas sig 
nificantly loner, than the control levels 
Snape et al . 1949, Wirts and Snape, 
1951) 

Although some aulbors have obtained 
good results with these tests there is much 
variation and overlap in results in normals 
and in patients with various pancreauc 
disorders (Janovwtz and Dreihng 1959, 
Necheles and Kirshen, 3957)

Test) 

The most direct way of determining pan 
creatic function is measurement of volume 
and analysis of pancreatic juice for bicar 
bonate and enzyme content after stimula 
Uon of the pancreas with secretin 

Dreilmg (1950 1954), Andersen (1942), 
and Gibbs (1950, 1953) studied the com 
position of pancreatic juice in normal in 
dnlduah and in vanous pancreatic disor 
ders (see Table 13-1) The normal for 
lipase secretion is 7000 to 14 000 umts per 
hour (135 to 225 umts per kg ) and 20 to 
40 Units per hour (0 35 to 0 7 umts per 
kg ) IS considered normal for try^sm se 
creuon (Cantarow and Trumpet 1955) 
Tliere is a wide variation of values even in 
normal persons The test has little or no 
value in the diagnosis of mild cases of 
chronic pancreatitis and m carcinoma of 
the tali of the pancreas (Lagerlof 1942 
Wirtsand Snape 1051) Normil secretion m 
these condiuons can probably be ascribed 
to the functional reserve of the pancreas 
In cases of decreased acinar function 
earliest abnormablies are usually found in 
amylase and lipase secretion Decreases in 
trypsin total volume and bicarbonate fol 
low with progression of the disease (Can 
tarow and Trumpet 1955 Dreiling 1953) 

In general it is sufficient to analyze the 
duodenal drainage for one of the enzymes 
only Amylase is the enzyTne of choice in 
adults If the test is lo be done m infants 
trypsin should be determined since the 
amylase production of mfants is extremely 
low and there is interference from salivary 
amylase (Andersen 1942) The duodenal

afication and carcinoma of the pancreas 
and edema of the pancreas Findings in 
these conditions are very similar and are 
of relatively little value in the differential 
diagnosis Some authors feel that the rela 
tive proportion of the different fractions 
may give additional information 

Pancreatic neoplasms alter the response 
to secretin depending on the location of the 
lesion and degree of duct obstruction 
(Dreiling 1953 Dreihng and Hollander 
1948) The secretion tends to he reduced 
m volume but normal in composition If a 
tumor does not obstruct the major duct 
response to secretin is usually norma] 
Acute inflammation causes destruction of 
secreting cells which in turn results in a 
decrease in both volume and concentration 
of the fluid (Dreiling 1953) Chronic pan 
creatitis results mainly in a decrease in bi 
carbonate but causes less of a decrease in 
the amylase content of the secretion (Com 
fort et al 1949 Dreihng and Hollander 
1948) In sprue pancreatic function is usu 
ally unaltered (Comfort et al 1949) The 
interested reader can find additional m 
formauon in the literature (Diamond and 
Siegal 1940 Dreiling 1954 Wms and 
Snape 1951) 

The greatest value of the secretin test is 
probably the possibility of excluding pan 
creatic dysfunction as in fibrocystic dis 
ease and in the differential diagnosis of 
steatorrhea of pancreatic origin from that 
owing to sprue or celiac disease 

The secretin test has additional advan 
tages A portion of the duodenal contents 
can be used for cytologic studies (Bother 
eau et al 1951 Lemon and Byrnes 1949) 
The first collection following admmistra 
tion of secretin should be exammed for 
that purpose Simultaneous determination 
of the icterus index or bilirubin In duodenal 
contents may furmsh information about 
gallbladder function Normally the fluid is 
faintly yellow at first then the color turns 
lighter and remams so throughout the test 
period This is explained by the closure of 
the sphincter of Boyden which prevents the 
release of bile accumulated in the gallblad 
der If the gallbladder Is nonfunctionuig or 
absent the pancreatic juice is deeply bile 
stained 

Tedinique of the Secrctm Test Patients 
should be in the fasting state Infants or 
children can be sedated with Seconal A 
double lumen gastroduodenal tube should 
be introduced under fluoroscopic guidance 
in such a way that the shorter end of the 
tube lies in the stomach and the longer 


»» 

end IS distal to the ampulla of Vater don 
slant suction is then applied and aspira 
tion IS continued until the duodenal fluid 
becomes clear and not contaminated by 
gastric juice (after approximately 20 min 
utes) At this time 1 unit of secretin per 
kg of body weight is given intravenously 
and specimens of duodenal and gastric con 
tent are collected at tenmmute intervals 
Each specimen obtained from the stomach 
Is examined for pH (Hydnon paper) A 
sudden drop in acidity indicates contamina 
tion by duodenal fluid The vanous ten 
minute speamens from the duodenum are 
analyzed for pH volume and occult blood 
Sudden changes m pH or volume indicate 
contamination by gastnc juice The pres 
ence of occult or overt blood may be help 
ful in pinpointing gastrointestmal bleed 
tags After GO minutes all duodenal speci 
mens are pooled and analyzed for volume 
and bicarbonate content and for amylase 
lipase or trypsin activity The pH can be 
determined with Hydnon paper or the pH 
meter bicarbonate concentration may be 
determmed with a VanSlyke gasometer 
amylase according to Somogyl (see p 
585) lipase according to Tietz et al (see 
p 587) and trypsin according to Varleys 
modification of the procedure by Lagerlof 
(see p 588) 

VBSORPTION TESTS 

The absorption tests to be listed are based 
on the theory that proper pancreatic func 
Hon IS essential for norm^ absorption of 
certain substances Although lack of proper 
absorption might have several causes nor 
mal absorption would more or less exclude 
pancreatic deficiency However the pan 
creas does have a large functional reserve 
and absorption may be normal in the pres 
ence of pancreatic disorders Absorption 
tests are most valuable in the diagnosis of 
fibrocystic disease of the pancreas 

The Fi/nmi« 1 Tolerance Test 

Serum vitamin A levels in children with 
cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and in adults 
with pancreatic insufficiency are usually 
below the normal range of 15 to GO 
per 100 ml or at its lower liirat Oral ad 
ministration of large amounts of v^tamln A 
in oil causes only slight increases m the 
scrum vitamin A in these patients Persons 
with normal absorption show rises from 
200 to 600 jxg of vitamin A per 100 ml 
of serum 



Laborator\ Tests Aiding in Diagnosis of Pancreatic Disorders 58^? 


Technique A fasting blood specimen is 
collected and 5000 umts of vitamin A (m 
oU) per kg of body iveight are given by 
mouth Further blood specimens axe drawn 
3, 6, and 24 hours later The patient may 
dnnk water or consume light meals during 
the first 6 hours, have full meals during the 
second 6 hours, and then should fast until 
withdrawal of the 24 hour specimen All 
specimens are analyzed for vitamin A con 
tent (see p 590) 

Fat Absorfitton Tests 

These tests are based on the theory that 
normal absorption of fat can take place 
only in the presence of normal pancreatic 
function (m this case secretion of lipase) 
Several approaches have been used to meas 
ure the rate of fat absorption from the In 
testinal tract 

The most commonly used test is the de 
termination of the total fat in a fasting 
serum specimen and in specimens with 
drawn three and six hours after admmis 
tration of a high fat meal (Hirsch et al , 
1953) 

The optical density of the serum before 
and after administration of a fat meal has 
also been used as a measure of fat absorp 
tion This test is much simpler to do but 
IS less accurate since turbidity of serum 
does not always represent its actual fat 
content A method such as the one sug 
gested by Schwartz and co workers (1952) 
may be used fox such serum turbidity meas 
urements 

In both of these procedures absorption 
curves tend to be flat in patients with im 
paired fat absorption 

More recent procedures are based on the 
administration of labeled triolein and 
oleic acid on separate days and the deter 
mination of the per cent of U®* found m 
the blood Normal absorption of I^®* labeled 
triolein indicates that pancreatic function 
IS probably normal or not greatly impaired, 
since absorption of this compound to any 
significant extent must be preceded by 
lipolytic hydrolysis Absorption of only 
oleic acid suggests impaired pancreatic 
function Failure of absorption of oleic acid 
indicates a malabsorption syndrome of non 
pancreatic origin The analvsis of in 
stool in addition to that of blood, increases 
the accuracy of the test and is therefore 
preferred by some 

Results obtained tvith these procedures 
are more accurate than those obtained with 
chemical tests but availability of an Isotope 


laboratory is essential (Berkotvitz et al , 
1959 Duffy and Turner, 1958, Kaplan 
et al, 1958) 

The Ltpiodol Test 

The Lipiodol test (Delory et al. 1956 
Groen 1948 Silverman and Shitkey 1955) 
IS based on the ability of normal children 
to absorb iodized oil and subsequently to 
excrete the iodme in the urme in a high 
concentration Children with impaired pan 
creatic function as in fibrocystic disease of 
the pancreas, absorb httle Lipiodol and 
therefore urine iodine concentrations are 
low This test which is only a screening 
procedure is easy to perform but carries 
the nsk of an iodine reaction in some pa 
tients It IS advisable to administer 0 5 gm 
of potassium iodide to all patients the 
evening before the test and to proceed tvith 
the test only if no rashes rhinitis head 
ache, conjunctivitis, or other side effects 
are observed (Groen 3948) 

Technique A urme specimen is col 
lected The patient Is then given 0 5 ml of 
Lipiodol (40 per cent) per kg of body 
weight by mouth or stomach tube (not less 
than 5 and nor more than 10 ml ) TTie 
second urine specimen is collected 12 to 
38 hours after Lipiodol administraeion 
Both specimens are checked for iodine (see 
p 591 ) A positive test in a 1 4 dilution 
or higher is said to exclude fibrocystic dis 
ease of the pancreas In one suggested pro- 
cedure the Lipiodol is given with breakfast 
and Its absorption followed with x rays 
Iodine excretion is determined in both urine 
and stool Such an elaborate approach 
seems hardly justifiable for clinical use 

ELECTROLYTE COMPOSITION OF 
SIVEAT AND SALIVA 

It has been found that the sodium and 
chloride contents of sweat in patients af 
fected by fibrocystic disease of the pancreas 
are significantly elevated even in the ab 
sence of gastrointestinal or respiratory 
symptoms or when no pancreatic insuffi 
ciency can be demonstrated by other tests 
The chloride concentration of sweat in 
normal individuals is between 4 and 60 
m£q per L with a mean of 32 mEq per 
L Patients with cystic fibrosis of the pan 
creas have values of 60 to 160 mEq per L 
with a mean of 133 mEq per L Concen 
trations abov e 70 mEq pet L arc con 
sidered diagnostic The sodium content of 
normal sweat ( 10 to 90 mEq per L ) 



584 


CUMCAL Diagnosis Labor vtor\ Methods 


overlaps the values obtained in patients 
with cystic fibrosis (80 to 190 itiEq per 
L ) (see Kaiser et al , 1956) 

False normal results can be obtamed in 
pure salt depletion which is common in 
the affected group of patients during hot 
weather Additional electrolyte studies on 
serum help to avoid mismterpretation of 
results m such instances Elevated sweat 
electrolyte composition has also been re 
ported in meconium ileus m adrenal in 
sufficiency and in some cases of renal dis 
ease 

The sweat test is the most valuable sm 
gle test m the diagnosis of fibrocystic dis 
ease of the pancreas In most affected m 
fants It becomes positive between three and 
five weeks of age 

The amount of sweat necessary to per 
form the sweat test is sometimes hard to 
obtain and modified procedures have been 
devised These tests are based on the ap- 
pearance of a white precipitate of silver 
chloride on an agar plate (Shvvachman 
and Galim 1956) or on a conunerctally 
available paper prepared with silver salts 
that have been in contact with the skm of 
the pauent Such tests should be used only 
for screening purposes since results are 
not so reliable as those obtamed from di 
rect measurement of sweat electrolyte con 
tents 

Similar elevations of sodium and chlo- 
ride have been found m the saliva of pa 
tients with fibrocystic diseases of the pan 
creas (Kaiser et al 1956) but the results 
of these determinations are inconsistent 
and by no means so rehable as those ob- 
tained from sweat (Procedures for obtain 
mg sweat are described on p 591 ) 

STOOL E^A’\II^ATIO^S 

The analysis of feces for vanous con 
stituents was once used widely to measure 
pancreatic function The simplest approach 
IS the microscopic identification and dem 
onstration of excess of undigested cell nu 
clei and meat fibers (creatonhea) of in 
creased fat (steatorrhea) and of increased 
starch (amylorrhea) (Hoffman 1954) 
Demonstration of these conditions is sug 
gesme of impaired absorption (see next 
section) In severe cases the feces are usu 
ally pale bulky and foul smelling In 
steatorrhea of pancreatic origin fat drop- 
lets usually appear in the feces on stand 
mg 

Unfortunately these tests have no diag 
nostic value in mild cases of pancreatic 


disease and in those cases in which the 
acute phase has subsided In addition some 
patients with severe pancreatic insufii 
ciency may have almost normal digestion 
owing to the compensatory mechanism of 
the body and the activity of rmcroorgan 
isms On the other hand patients with 
celiac disease or sprue may have stools 
similar to those of patients with pancreatic 
insufficiency (because of mcreased mtes 
tinal motiJity) The quantitative assay of 
fat and nitrogen m the stool is more help- 
ful but It also has its hmitations 

Fat in Stool Ingested fat is normally 
split by pancreatic lipase mto fatty acids 
and glycerol or monoesters of glycerol and 
the products of hydrolysis are absorbed by 
the intestinal tract Therefore, the stool 
content of neutral fat, free fatty acids and 
soaps is relatively low If the amount of 
total fat exceeds 25 per cent of the dry 
matter one may consider the stool ab- 
normal Increase of the neutral fat poriion 
to 11 per cent of the dry matter or 55 
per cent of the total fecal fat represents a 
deficiency in fat sphttmg activity If the 
amount of hydrolyzed fat (soaps and free 
fatty acids) exceeds 16 per cent of the dry 
matter or 75 per cent of the total fat the 
condition is usually due to deficient fat 
absorption There are conditions (for ex 
ample gastrocobc fistula) in which the 
neutral fat portion is elevated to the same 
extent as m pancreatic disorders Obstruc 
tive jaundice is sometimes accompamed by 
a total stool fat content of up to 75 per 
cent of dry matter It has been suggested 
that the large amount of fecal fat m this 
disorder is largely due to the excretion of 
fat by the intestinal mucosa rather than 
to diinimshed absorption (Cantarow and 
Trumper, 1955) 

Fractional analysis of fecal fat can thus 
be of some help in diagnosmg or excluding 
pancreatic insufficiency but is of no value 
in differentiatmg specffic pancreatic condi 
tions 

Isitrogen (Protein) m Stool The feces of 
normal individuals usually do not contain 
more than 5 to 10 yier cent of the nitrogen 
of the food ingested Increase in the ratro- 
gen content especially to 25 per cent or 
above can be mterpreted as evidence of 
pancreatic insufficiency, provided intestinal 
motihty and absorption are normal The 
mtrogen content is mcreased also in sprue 
but It seldom exceeds 17 per cent of the 
ingested mtrogen 

Microscopic Examination of Stool The 
microscopic examination for meat fibers is 


Laboratory Tfsts Aiding in Diagnosis of Pancreatic Disorders 585 


a means of differentiating between pam 
creatic disorders and increased intestinal 
motility owing to other causes. Meat fibers 
with sharp, angular ends and transverse 
striations are only found if pancreatic en- 
zymes are greatly diminished or absent 
Feces of patients with increased intestinal 
motility o%ving to nonpancreatlc causes may 
also contain meat fibers, but these have 
rounded ends and no transverse striations 
(Cantarow and Trumpcr, 1955), 

MISCELL.ANEOUS FINDINGS IN 
PANCREATIC DISIhVSES 

A significant number of patients with 
acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as 
with carcinoma of the body and tail of 
the pancreas, show a decreased glucose 
tolerance. Fasting hyperglycemia is ob- 
ser\'ed in acute pancreatitis but only in 15 
to 30 per cent of cases of chronic pan- 
creatitis. Glycosuria has been reported in 
5 to 25 per cent of cases of acute pan- 
creatitis. 

Serum calcium levels are decreased to 
the range of 8.0 to 8.5 mg. per 100 ml. In 
the majority of cases of acute pancreatitis 
and occasionally arc as low as 7.0 mg. per 
100 ml. These changes have been observed 
24 to 72 hours after the attack and arc 
attributed to sudden %vjthdrawal of calcium 
from extracellular fluids by its fixation as 
calcium soaps (Cantarow and Trumpcr, 
1955; Llpp and Hubbard, 1950; Popper 
and Necheles, 1959). 


METHODS 

Determitiation of 'Amylase in Serttm anti 
Dttodetial Contents 

Principle. Amylase hydrolyzes starch 
into reducing sugars (mainly maltose and 
glucose). The reducing sugars in the sam- 
ple, in a serum control, and in a starch 
blank are determined wdth the Folin-Wu 
method. The reducing power of the sample 
—(serum blank -f- starch blank) calculated 
as mg. glucose per 300 ml. is considered 
as being the amylolytic activity in units. 

Ilcage7its 

1. Copper sulfate (5 per cent). Dis- 
solve 50 gm. of CuSO^'SH^O in water, trans- 
fer to a 1000 ml. volumetric flask, and 
dilute to mark. Store in glass stopper bottle. 

2. Sodium tungstate (6 per cent). 
Dissolve 60 gm. of NajWO^-2H20 in a 1000 
ml. volumetric flask, dilute to mark \vjth 
water, and mix. 


3. Alkaline copper solution. Add 40 
gm. of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 
7.5 of tartaric acid to a 1 liter volu- 
metric flask that contains approximately 
400 ml. of distilled water. After these re- 
agents are completely dissolved, 4,5 gm. of 
copper sulfate (CuSO^*5HjO) are added 
and dissolved. The contents of the flask 
are then brought to 1 liter with distilled 
water and mixed by inversion. If a red 
sediment forms on standing, the super- 
natant fluid or liquid is decanted or filtered 
into another container. 

4. Phosphomolybdlc acid solution. To 
a 2 liter Erlenmeyer flask or beaker add 
400 ml, of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide, 
70 gm. of molybdic acid (HoMoO^), 10 gm. 
of sodium tungstate (Na.AVO^), and 400 
ml. of distilled water. Add a few glass beads 
and boil the solution for 30 minutes (to 
remove all ammonia) and cool. The con- 
tents are transferred to a 1 liter volumetnc 
flask with the aid of enough water to bring 
the volume to approximately 700 ml. Place 
flask in a cold water bath and add cau- 
tiously 250 ml. of 85 per cent phosphoric 
acid, dilute to 1 liter \vith water, and mix. 
The solution should not bo blue. 

5. Starch paste. Place 100 gm. corn- 
starch U.S.P. into a 2000 ml. Erlenmeyer 
flask, add 1000 ml. of 0.01 N HCl, and 
stir for one hour. Allow the starch to settle 
down, decant supernatant, and add 1000 
ml. of 0.05 per cent NaCI solution. Repeat 
the washing with NaCl, decant, and spread 
the washed starch on a filter paper until 
dry. This purified starch is very stable and 
can be kept for future use if stored in a 
dry place. 

Grind 3 gm. of purified starch in a mor- 
tar. add 10 ml. of HgO, and transfer this 
suspension into 380 ml. of boiling ivater. 
Rinse the mortar \vith an additional 10 
ml. of water and add this to the solution. 
Boil for one minute with agitation and 
(hen keep the solution for 15 minutes in 
a 100** C. water bath. During the heating 
process place an inverted beaker over the 
mouth of the flask to minimize evaporation. 
If kept in the refrigerator, this solution is 
stable for at least one week. 

6. Acid-sodium chloride (1 per cent). 
Dissolve 10 gm. of NaCl in some distilled 
water, transfer to a 1 liter volumetric flask, 
and add 3 ml. of 0.1 N HCl. Dilute to 
mark and mix. 

7. Glucose standard. 

Stock (10 mg. per ml.). Desiccate 
some reagent grade glucose for at 
least three days before use. Place

Method 

1 Into each of two test tubes add 5 
ml of starch paste and 2 ml of acid NaCl 
solution Mark one tube “test” and the other 
“blank and place both tubes into a water 
bath at 40° C for file minutes 

2 Add 1 ml of serum to the “test” 
and 1 ml of iiater to the "blank* and mix 
well 

3 Incubate both tubes for exactly 30 
minutes at 40° C 

4 Prepare a serum control by adding 
1 ml serum 2 ml acid NaCl and 5 ml 
i/ater to a third test tube marked “control ” 

5 Add to the “control " and imme- 
diatcly after 30 minutes incubation also 
to the “test” and "blank 1 ml of 5 per 
cent copper sulfate solution Mlx uell and 
subsequent!} add 1 ml 6 per cent sodium 
tungstate 

6 Mix all tubes well allcn\ to stand 
about fl>e minutes and filter content 
through ^Vhatman No 40 filter paper or

6 Transfer the tubes without shaking 
to a cold water bath for four minutes 

7 Add 2 0 ml of phosphomoljbdic 
acid to each tube and mix After one min 
ute (when efferaesccnce has ceased) di 
lute to 25 ml with distilled water 

8 Stopper all tubes and mix b> In 
lersion Allow to stand for 8 minutes 


9 Read all samples In a spectropho- 
tometer at 420 m/i, using the blank to set 
instrument at 100 per cent transmission 
Calculate amount of reducing substance 
from a chart or standard cune 

Calculitions The reducing power of the 
“lest” depends on the reducing substances 
in the specimen and starch as well as on 
the reducing sugars formed during the 
incubation period (owing to the amylolytic 
actmty) The “control* measures onlv the 
reducing substances in the original serum 
The "blank" measures any reducing sub- 
stance that ma> be present in the starch 
solution Therefore reducing power of 
“test —"contror— “blank" is equal to the 
amylase leiel in units 
Remarks and Sources of Error 

1 Prepare a standard cur\c for lalues 
up to 400 mg glucose per 100 ml If the 
“test” has a reducing power equivalent to 
more than 400 mg of glucose the test 
should be repeated using less filtrate (c g 

1 0 ml Instead of 2 0 ml ) and making up 
the difference by adding distilled water or 
saline Multiply the finM result by the di 
lution factor cmplo}ed 

2 The use of an improperly prepared 
or old starch paste inaccurate timing of 
incubation and incorrect temperature of 
the water bath arc the most common 
sources of error 

3 If the reducing power of the “blank” 
reaches any appreciable leiel the test must 
be repeated wah a new starch paste 

4 If duodenal fluid is to Ik analyzed 
a 1 200 dilution with sahne should be 
u»ed and results should be multiplied b) 
100 and corrected for the total \olume 

5 Somogyl (1960) has recommended a 
modified starch paste and stated that the 
reducing power of the filtrate can be dc 
termmed with the FohnWu method or 
with anv of the methods measuring true 
glucose 

>00031 ^ allies Normal values are ex 
pressed in Somogjl units One unit equals 
1 mg of reducing substances per 100 ml 
of serum calculated as glucose Although 
Somogyi in his original paper (1941) gave 
30 to 180 units as the normal range prob- 
ably all values above 250 units should be 
considered abnormal

be 1 in 20. 

This lube contains 2 ml. of a 1:20 di- 
2 

lulion of urine. That means that ml. 

of urine contain just sufficient amylase to 
digest 1 ml. of a 0.2 per cent starch solu- 
tion (or 2 ml. of a 0.1 per cent starch 
solution) in 30 minutes. 

One ml. of urine, therefore, digests 
''Ox'* 

— 20 ml. of 0.1 per cent starch solu- 
tion, which is equivalent to 20 Wohlgemuth 
units. 

The number of units per ml. in the last 
tube with no blue color will be as foUotvs 
Tube Is 5 units p«T ml 
Tube 2 s 10 units pet ml. 

Tube 3 s 20 units per ml. 

TuW 4 = 40 units per ml. 

Tube 5 ss 80 units per ml. 

Tube 0 B 160 units per ml. 

Tube 7 a 320 units per ml. 

Normal Values 

Random specimen: 2 to 50 units per 
ml. 

24-hour specimen: 6 to 30 units per 
ml. 

Rcm.'irLs anti .Sources of Error. Values 
obtained with a 24-hour urine specimen are 
more valuable than those obtained wth a 
random specimen. The urine may be pre- 
6cr^•ed with a little toluene. The total urine 
volume should always be reported. This 
procedure will give falsely low results if 
the starch solution is old or if the N/50 
iodine solution has not been prepared on 
the same day it is used. 

Determwation of Lifiase in Serum aiul 
Duodenal Contents 

Principle. Lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides 
(for example, olive oil) to fatty acids and 
glycerine or its mono- and diesters. The 
liberated fatty acids are titrated with N/20 
NaOH, using thymolphthalcin as indicator. 

Reagents* 

1. Olive oil emulsion. Add 0.2 gm. of 
sodium benzoate and 7.0 gm, of gum arabic 
(acacia) U.S.P, to 93 ml. of distilled water 
and mix in blender until dissolved. Slowly 
add 93 ml. of obve oU U.S.P. and continue 
mixing for five minutes. This emulsion is

form as preser\ative and keep the reagent 
refngerated Discard the reagent If bac- 
terial contammation has occurred 

Method 

1 Into each of two test tubes marked 
•Tilank” and “test" pipet 2 5 ml disoUed 
water 3 0 ml oh\e oil emulsion, and 10 
ml buffer of pH 8 0 

2 Into the ‘ test" test tubes pipet 1 0 
ml serum and mix well If duodenal fluid 
IS to be analyzed, two determinations 
should be earned out one test ivith a I 10 
and another ivith a 1 100 dilution of 
duodenal fluid instead of serum 

3 Pipet 1 0 ml serum or diluted 
duodenal fluid into a 50 ml Erlemneyer 
flask labeled “blank" and store this flask 
m the refrigerator 

4 Incubate “test and “blank" tubes in 
a water bath at 37° C for six hours In 
case of an emergency, run tests in du 
plicate and incubate one set for three hours 
only 

5 Pour contents of “blank" tube into 
the Erlenmeyer flask stored in the re 
fngerator Pour contents of ‘test” tube into 
a clean 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask 

6 Pipet 3 0 ml 95 per cent ethanol 
into “blaidv" and "test” test tubes, shake, 
and add to respective Erlenmeyer flasks 

7 Add 4 drops thymolphthalein to 
"blank” and "test” and titrate to a hght 
blue color with N/20 NaOH 

8 Subtract “lilank’ reading from 
"test" reading The difference between these 
readings represents the units of lipase per 
ml of serum If a three hour incubation 
time was used results should be doubled 
In case of duodenal fluid results should be 
multipbcd by dilution and total volume 

Remarks and Sources ol Error. The 
buffer and the serum should be pipetted 
with volumetric and Oswald Folin pipets, 
respectively The olive oil emulsion can best 


be pipeted with a 10 ml serologic pipet or 
vnth an automanc synnge type plpel 

"rhe pH of the buffer is critical Incorrect 
adjustment causes low results Serum 
lipase, when frozen or stored in a refriger 
ator, is stable for several days Slight he 
molysis does not mterfere with the test, 
but strongly hemolyzed specimens should 
not be used 

'The dilution for duodenal fluid deter- 
minations IS necessary, since the buffer 
used in the procedure is not effective 
enough to compensate for the alkaline pH 
of the duodenal content In addition the 
extremely high lipolytic activity of some 
duodenal fluids would cause an excessive 
production of free fatty acids, which m 
turn would inhibit the reaction 

Normal Values Values up to IQ umt 
lipase per ml of serum should be consid 
ered normal and those up to J 2 units per 
ml as borderhne (Tietz et al, 1959) 

Determinatton of Trypsin in Duodenal 
Contents 

Principle. Casein, when incubated at 
30° C with duodenal contents at a pH of 
9 0, IS hydrolyzed, and the increase m 
carboxyl groups is determined by titration 
with N/10 alcohobc KOH Since alcohol 
suppresses the basic properties of the ammo 
acids, the utration can be earned out di 
rectly 

Reagents 

1 Casein solution Place 30 gm of 
casern in a 500 ml flask, add 300 ml of 
distilled water, and shake vigorously for 
five minutes Then add 20 ml of 1 N 
ammomum hydroxide and shake for an 
additional 20 minutes Bring the volume to 
500 ml with distilled water The reagent 
is stable for four days if kept in the re 
fngerator 

2 Buffer solution Mix 120 ml each 
of 1 N ammonium hydroxide and 1 N 
ammomum chlonde and add 160 ml of 
distilled water Keep reagent refngerated 

3 N/10 alcohobc KOH Mix 1 part of 
1 N KOH with 9 parts of absolute alcohol 

4 Thymolphthalein (0 5 per cent) in 
95 per cent ethanol 

Method Prepare all dilution of du 
odenal fluid with glycetol immediately after 
collection of the specimen Keep this solu 
tion refrigerated

2 Place the tube in a water bath at 30® 
C for sy minutes and add 2 ml of buffer 
solution After exactly 30 seconds add 3 
ml of the casein solution Shake well and 
Incubate the tube for 20 minutes 

3 Measure into each of two 250 ml 
flasks 38 ml of 95 per cent alcohol 3 ml 
of water and 1 ml of indicator Mark one 
flask blank” and one flask “test " 

4 Exactly 20 minutes after addition of 
the casein pour the contents of the test 
tube into the flask marked “test and rinse 
the test lube well with the contents of the 
flask 

5 Into the flask marked blank” add 2 
ml of duodenal contents (11) 2 ml of 
bufier and 3 ml of casein solution 

6 Titrate both flasks with alcoholic N/10 
KOH to the first appearance of a blue color 

7 Add 72 ml of boiling 95 per cent 
alcohol to each flask (the blue color trill 
disappear) and continue titration until the 
same blue color appears in both flasks It 
IS essential that this titration be carried 
out rapidly 

Calculiijon Subtract lilank reading 
from test reading determine the units from 
the following chart and multiply this figure 
by total \oIunie of duodenal contents per 
hour (shoivn at bottom of page) 

Isonnal Values Trypsm is excreted at 
the rate of 20 to 40 (Lagcrlof) units per

De/ermi»m/ion of Trypuu in Stool 

principle A stool emulsion is placed on 
an xray film Presence of trypsm is indl 
cated by the digestion of the gelatm layer 
after a one hour incubation at 37“ C 

Method 

1 Place 4 ml saline into a glass 
stopper cylinder and add stool until the 
meniscus reaches the 5 ml mark (1 5 dl 
lution) Mix well 

2 Place one large drop of this cmul 


slon on the gelatin side of an unexposed 
xray film The film is clipped to a card 
board to prevent curling and placed in a 
PetM dish contaming a wet filter paper to 
prevent drying of the stool 

3 Add 5 ml of saline (o the 1 5 
stool emulsion mix and place one drop of 
this 1 10 dilution on the same or a sep 
arate xray film 

4 Incubate the film for one hour at 
37“ C (or for two hours at room tem 
perature) 

5 After incubation wash film under 
a gentle stream of cold water A clearmg at 
the sue of the drops indicates enzyme ac 
tivity The degree of activity is estimated 
as follows 

A beginning (slight) d gesUon inth the 1 5 diiu 
tion IS read as 1+ 

A moderate digest on with the 1 5 d lution is 
read as 2+ 

A moderate digestion with the 1 lO dilution is 
read as 34 

A complete digest on with the 1 lO dilution is 
read as 4-f- 

No change on the surface of the xzay film or 
Just some roughness is considered negative 

Remarks and Sources of Error Any x ray 
film cut in squares of approximately 1 
X 1 5 can be used but dental films are 
most oonvement The film should not be 
stored longer than the expiration date and 
it should be unexposed and unde\ eloped 
When a film Is being used for the first 
ume an adequate control should be run 

Sufficient moisture in the Petn dwh is 
necessary for the enzymatic reaction and 
to prevent caking of the stool 

Some microorganisms have proteolytic 
activity However Shwachman (1949) 
demonstrated that the activity is relatively 
slight compared to that of pancreatic juKC 

To detect interference by bacterial pro 
(eases one drop of a 0 2 per cent solution 
of a commercially available specific anti 
trypsm in saline may be added to a separate 
stool emulsion The antitrypsin inhibits the 
pancreatic trypsin but not bacterial pro- 
teases A test IS considered positive only

The Vitamin A Tolerance Test and the 
Determtiiation of Vtlatntn A ayid 
Carotenoid in Sentm 

Principle. Serum proteins are precipitated 
by alcohol and Mtamin A and carotenoids 
are extracted by petroleum ether The 
carotenoids are determmed by colonmetnc 
reading of the petroleum ether layer at a 
wa%e length of 440 m/i 

Vitamin A content is determmed bv 
eiaporating the petroleum ether and adding 
antimony tnchlonde to the residue The 
blue color produced (Carr Price reaction) 
IS read m a colorimeter at a Mate length 
of 620 mu Since carotenoids also give a 
shght color in this reaction a correction 
factor IS apphed 

Administration of Vitamin A Directions 
for administration of the vitamin A for a 
tolerance test and mstructions for coUec 
tion of blood specimens are given on p 
582 

Reagents 

1 Antimony tnchlonde 22 per cent

methanol The filtered precipitate should 
be washed with a few drops of methanol 
and dried in a vacuum desiccator Transfer 
30 0 mg purified beta-carotene to a 100 
ml volumetnc flask dissolve and dilute to 
volume with petroleum ether Prior to use

dilute to volume with petroleum ether A 
standardized concentrate of vitamin A is 
also suitable for preparmg this standard 
solution Before using dilute the stock 
standard 1 10 with petroleum ether 

Method for Carotenoid and Vitamin 
A Determination 

1 Into each of two 5 ml glass stopper 
centrifuge tubes pipet exactly 1 0 ml 
serum 2 0 ml 95 per cent ethanol and 2 0 
ml petroleum ether Stopper lubes tightly 
and shake vigorously for ten minutes 

2 CJentnfuge the stoppered tubes and 
transfer 1 0 ml of the petroleum ether 
layer (top) mto a microcmet (for example 
a 10 X 75 mm Coleman cuvet) 

3 Read immediately in a spectropho- 
tometer (or colorimeter) at a wave length 
of 440 oift agamst a petroleum ether blank 
Calculate carotenoid values from calibra 
lion curve or chart 

4 Evaporate the petroleum ether to 
dryness by placing the cuvets into a water 
bath of 40 to 45® C and by gently blowing 
dry au (or nitrogen) into tbe cuvet A 
stream of dry air can be obtained by pass 
mg the air first through a bottle containing 
silica gel Tlie tubes must be absolutely 
dry to avoid cloudiness in the Can Price 
reacuon 

5 Set tbe spectrophotometer to a wave 
length of 620 m^ and adjust to 100 per 
cent transmittance usmg the awtimouT 
tnchlonde solution as blank 

6 Add exactly 1 0 ml of the 22 per 
cent antimony tncUonde solution and read 
unTOediately, since the blue celoc produced 
IS extremely evanescent Any cloudmess 
that might develop at this point is usually 
due to moisture m the cuvet or in the 
antimony tnchlonde solution In such a 
case the test must be repeated taking pre- 
cautions to avoid moisture 
Calculaiions 

Carotenoids Determme the amount of 
carotenoids per cuvet from the standard 
curve and cam out tbe following calcula 
tions 

gamma carotenoids/cu vet x ddudon X 100 
ml serum used 

= gamma carotenoids/lOO ml serum 
If this procedure is followed with respect 
to quantiues the equation reduces to 
gamma carotenoids/cuvei X 200 = 
gamma carotenoids/100 ml serum 

I ilamtn A Determine the amount of

vitamin A per cuvet from the standard 
curve and carry out the following calcula 
tions 

gamma vitamin A/cuvet x dilution X 100 
ml sMum^sed 

— (0 075 X gamma carotenoids) 

= gamma vitamin A/100 ml serum 

If the quantities used are those given in 
the procedure the equation reduces to 

gamma vitamin A/cuvet X 200 

— (0 075 X gamma carotenoids) 

= gamma vitamin A/100 ml serum 
Subtraction of gamma carotenoids x 

0 075 IS necessary to correct for the amount 
of color produced by the carotenoids 
Calibration 

Carotenoids Prepare a cabbration curve 
by using solutions of beta carotene in pe 
troleum ether (see reagents) m concentra 
tions of 0 5, 1 0, 1 5, 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 
gamma per ml 

Vifomin A The calibration curve for 
vitamin A is prepared by using ahquots of 
a solution of vitamin A alcohol m petro 
leum ether (see reagents) resulting in 
concentrations of 05 10 15 20 25 
and 3 0 gamma vitamin A per cuvet Pro- 
ceed as outlined in steps 4 to 6 of pro 
cedure 

Normal Values The normal carotenoid 
level (mainly beta carotene and xaniho 
phyll) IS 100 to 300 gamma per 100 ml 
serum calculated as beta carotene Vitamin 
A IS normally found m serum in concen 
nations of 15 to 60 gamma per 100 ml 
(approximately 50 to 200 LTSP units) 
Remarks ind Sources of Error The Carr 
Price reaction gives a color with caret 
enoids as well as with vitamin A The 
carotenoids viverefore have to be deter 
mined before the vitaram A content can be 
calculated 

All reagents used must be water free 
since moisture results in cloudiness and 
erroneous results 

One International and USP unit of vita 
min A is defined as 0 30 gamma of vitamin 
A alcohol or 0 344 gamma of vitamin A 
acetate and 0 6 gamma of pure beta 
carotene Is considered to have the activity 
of one unit of vitamin A (Carr and Price 
1926 and Koch and Hanke 1953) 

The Ltfnodol Test 

Principle The principle of the test and 
the procedure for the administration of 
Lipiodol are explained on p 583 
Alethod 

1 Place five test tubes in a test tube 


rack and add 0 5 ml distilled water to 
tubes 2 through 5 

2 Add 0 5 ml of unne to tubes 1 
and 2 

3 Mix tube 2 and transfer 0 5 ml to 
tube 3 Continue with this procedure and 
discard 0 5 ml from tube 5 The tubes now 
contain 0 5 ml of unne or unne and dis 
tilled water m dilutions 11 1 4 1 16 and 

1 32 respectively 

4 Add to each tube 5 drops of freshly 
prepared 8 N nitric acid mix and add 3 
drops of a fresh 1 per cent starch solution 

The presence of a blue color is read as 
positive A faint color which disappears 
after five minutes or a colorless solution 
is considered negative 

Nonml Values Patients with normal 
pancreatic function show a positive test in 
a unne dilution of 1 4 or above 

Remarks and Sources of Error The 
starch used m the procedure should be 
reasonably fresh and the nitric acid must 
be prepared directlj before use The test is 
only valid if the unne specimen pnor to 
administration of the drug was found to 
be negative for iodine 

Interruption of meals during the test Is 
not necessary but enzyme therapy must 
be discontinued at least 46 hours before 
the test (Silverman and Shirkey 1955) 

The Stveat Test 

Collection of Sweat The back of the 
child is carefully washed with distilled 
water and two gauze sponges on top of 
each other are placed on either side of the 
spine The sponges should be approximately 

2 X 2 in svxe and ■sVionW be cleaned vilvb 
distilled or deionized water dried and 
weighed exactly in a labeled Petri dish be 
fore use A plastic sheet approximately 
4' X 4 ' is put on top of the gauze and 
tightly sealed with surgical tape A plastic 
bag IS then placed around the child and 
tied around the neck Sweating can be 
accelerated by wrapping the patient In an 
additional blanket or by using a heating 
lamp After a sufiicient amount of sweat is 
collected (usually after IS to 60 minutes) 
the gauze is removed and sent to the Jab 
oratory in the same Petri dish (Use a 
forceps to prevent contamination and cover 
Petn dish to prevent evaporation ) Note 
Avoid overheating the chiJd Do not pro- 
long the sweating period beyond 60 min 
utes 

Recovery of Sweat Weigh sponges and

of sneat collected, and recover the sweat 
by placing the sponges in a funnel and 
vrashing them with deionized water Also 
nnse the Petn dish The washings are col- 
lected in a volumetnc flask This procedure 
is simple but has the disadvantage that the 
sweat IS not in the original concentration 
and that the dilution factor has to be cal- 
culated It has been recommended recently 
that a golf tee be placed point down in a 
15 ml comcal centrifuge tube and that the 
sponges be put on top of the tee The tube, 
tightly sealed with a rubber cap, is then 
centrifuged at moderate speed "Ihe sweat 
wiH accumulate m the tip of the tube in 
Its original concentration If this pro- 
cedure IS used weighing of the sponges is 
not necessary (See also p 508 ) 

ADaI)sis of Sweat The concentration of 
sodium or chlonde m sweat can be deter- 
mined vvnth any of the common laboratory 
procedures A proper dilution for the so- 
dium determination can easily be calculated 
if the chlonde analysis is done first, smce 
Na and Cl results parallel each other fairly 
closel) 

Normal Values 

Na 10 to 90 m£q per L 

Cl 4 to 60 mEq per L 
Remarks and Sources of Error. Falsely 
high results can be obtained if the skm of 
the child IS not cleaned properly or if con 
taminated sponges are used Some labora 
tones have abandoned the use of sponges 
and collect the sweat with a capillary tube 
directly from the bag and the skin of the 
patient The amount of sweat collected with 
such a procedure is greater, but results 
are less rehable smce ev aporation can 
cause an mcrease m electrolyte concentra

Gastric 


aif3. Duodenal Contents 


By JAMES C CAIN. M D , mid LLOVD G BARTHOLOMUV, M D 


Many ingenious methods ha\c been de 
Msed to obtain the secretions of the stom 
ach and it appears reasonable to hope that 
examination of the gastric contents Jn 
health and disease may shed light on the 
state of the patients health 

EXAMINATION OV CASTIUC 
CONTENTS 

The gastric contents consist essentially 
of water free hydrochloric acid combined 
hydrochloric acid pepsin rcnnln mineral 
salts (chiefly acid phosphates) particles of 
undigested and partly digested food and 
various products of digestion In solution 
The amount and character of the gastric 
contents vary with the state of digestion 
In pathologic conditions there may be 
added new substances such as various ml 
croscopic structures and certain organic 
acids especially lactic acid 

Gastric digestion consists mainly of the 
action of pepsin on proteins in the presence 
of hydrochloric acid and of curdling of 
mill, by tennin The lat spelling ferment 
lipase of the gastric juice has extremely 
little activity except on previously cmulsl 
ficd fats such as those of milk and egg 
yolk 

Pepsin and rennln arc secreted by the 
gastric glands as zymogens namely pep- 
sinogen and renninogen which arc con 
verted into pepsin and rcnnln by hydro 
chloric acid Hydrochloric acid Is secreted 
chiefly by the fundus of the stomach It at 
once combines loosely with the proteins of 
the food and forms acid metaprotcin, the 
first step in the digestion of protein Ily 
drochloric acid that thus is combinod 


loosely with protein is called “combined 
hydrochloric acid ” The acid that is secreted 
after all the proteins present have been 
converted into acid metaproteins remains 
as “free hydrochloric acid”, together with 
pepsin it continues the process of digestion 

In normal persons the character and 
amount of gastric secretion obtained by 
gastric intubation vary greatly Such fac 
tors as age sex temperature emotions 
Slate of digestion, type of test meal degree 
of dilution or neutralization by swallowed 
saliva or by regurgitated duodenal contents 
amount of gastric dilatation and position 
of the tip of the tube all cause variations 
in gastric secretion In normal persons Thus 
only vague limits of normal can be sug 
gested as follows ✓The volume under fast 
Ing conditions averages 25 to 50 ml more 
ylhan 150 ml being definitely abnormal the 
height of the response after a test meal is 
•^0 to AO units or degrees of free hydro- 
/chloric acid and 30 to 60 units or degrees 
of total acidity The normal gross charac 
tcnstics are as follows fairly fluid no food 
particles pearly gray, usually htUe mucus 
usually no bile sharp sour odor, and no 
blood 

It is the clinician’s responsibility to ask 
himself what he expects to learn from a 
gastric analysis This is not a dangerous 
test but it is not entirely innocuous Al 
though It Is a time honored procedure. Its 
usefulness actually is limited Tlie presence 
or absence of free hydrochloric acid is often 
pertinent and it is occasionally helpful to 
know whether the amount of free hydro- 
chloric add is high low, or normal ^ic 
amount and character of the fluid seldom 
are diagnostic, yet in specific instances

they may give a clue to the diagnosis Some 
of the more elaborate and refined tests 
using the collection of gastric juice as part 
of their technique may prove of real^lag 
nostic value These tests require careful 
standardization and thus frequently are 
utilized only in research More elaborate 
studies include the augmented histamine 
test the 12 hour collection of nocturnal 
secretion the msulin test paper electro 
phoresis of gastric juice electrogastrog 
raphy and cytologic study of the gastric 
sediment Because of the disagreeable as 
pects of passing a gastric tube the so called 
tubeless gastric analysis is used frequently 
in some laboratories Its value is ev en more 
uncertain than that of the time-honored 
routine gastnc analysis 

Oblainttig the Gastric Contents 

Technique for Passing die Gastric Tube 
Gastnc juice is secreted continuously in 
varying amounts In clinical work it is de 
suable to obtain the juice with as little 
mechanical or psychologic trauma as pos 
sible Various types of tubes have been 
devised for removal of the gastnc contents 
It is preferable to use a small tube with an 
opemng at the tip and several holes in the 
side near the tip * If retained food par 
tides are present it occasionally may be 
necessary to revert to one of the larger 
tubes such tubes should be used with great 
care preferably being passed only by one 
trained in such a procedure 

It IS important to assure the patient that 
introduction of the tube cannot possibly 
harm him and that if he can control the 
spasm of his throat he will expenence 
only a minimal choking sensation Ex 
planation of the procedure as well as a 
demonstration of the tube to the patient 
prior to its passage is frequently reassur 
ing The tube should be chilled in ice water 
in order to reduce nausea The use of 
glycenn or other lubricants is usually un 
necessary 

With the patient seated on a chair his 
clothing protected by towels or a large 
apron and his head tipped forward the 
tip of the tube held as one nould hold a 
pen is introduced far back into the 
pharynx The technician stands to the right 
of the patient with the tip of the tube in 
the nght hand and the remainder coiled 
in the left hand Instruct the patient to 
open his mouth and then pass the tube over 

• A number of tubes have been designed by SHch 
workers as Sawyer Juttc Levin Rcbfuss and Lyon 


the top and middle of the tongue When the 
Up oC the tube teaches the poslenor v\ all 
of the pharynx tell the patient to close his 
mouth lightly on the tube and to swallow 
Ptish gently and firmly on the tube Wait 
until the patient resumes deep breathing 
through his mouth then have the patient 
swallow agam while the tube again is 
pushed downward 

Bepeat these procedures until the tube 
enters the esophagus Pass the tube gently 
and not too rapidly into the stomach Saliva 
should be expectorated It is not necessary 
to hurry and it is most important that the 
patient be kept at ease to enable him to 
relax Breathing through the mouth must 
be encouraged at all times Pass the tube 
to the second mark (55 cm ) During the 
remamder of the procediSe the tube may 
be placed between the teeth and cheek on 
either side the patient holding a towel 
over his mouth against the protruding lube 

With a large glass syringe gently as 
pirate the gastnc contents If matenal is 
not recovered when the tube is inserted to 
the second mark remove the synnge and 
withdraw the tube about 3 cm and aspirate 
again This procedure may be repeated 
until the tube is withdrawn to the first mark 
if necessary Do not use strong suction in 
aspirating the gastnc contents At tunes it 
may be convement and less traumatic to 
pass the small gastnc tube through an 
unobstructed nostril 

Technique jor Study of Gastric Contents 

Routine Qualitative Examination 

A routine quahtative exammation is con 
veniently earned out in the following 
order 

1 Give the patient a test meal after an 
overnight fast 

2 At the height of digestion usually In 
one hour remove 30 to 25 ml of the gas 
tnc contents with a gastnc tube 

3 Afeasure the contents and examine 
them macroscopically 

4 Filter the contents A suction filter is 
desirable and its use may be necessary 
when much mucus Is present (Some clin 
ical pathologists prefer to titrate the gas 
tnc contents without filtering ) 

5 During filtration examine the ma 
tenal microscopically and make qualitative 
tests for free hydrochloric acid and lactic 
acid 

6 When sufficient filtrate is obtained 
make quantitative estimations of total

acidity free hydrochlonc acid and com 
bmed hydrochloric acid (if necessary) 

7 Make other tests that appear to be 
pertinent such as tests for blood pepsin 
or rennin 

8 If free hydrochloric acid is present in 
the specimen removed at the end of the 
first hour wait 15 minutes empty the 
stomach completely and examine the con 
tents as m step 6 This concludes the test 

^Fractional Gastric Analysis 

A fractional gastric analysis is done if 
the test just descnbed fads to show the 
presence of free hydrochlonc acid Small 
samples (10 to 25 ml ) are taken at 15- 
minute intervals dunng the second hour 
Each sample is examined grossly meas 
ured and titrated These results and the 
tune each specimen was taken are re 
corded If free hydrochloric acid appears 
in any of the 15 minute samples titrate and 
record the amount At this point the stom 
ach can be emptied completely and the 
test concluded A benzidine test may be 
done on a portion of the first specimen if 
gross blood is present in subsequent frac 
tions 

•^est Meals and Stimulants 

As already noted gastric juice is se- 
creted continuously but quantities sufTi 
cicntly large for examination are often not 
obtainable under fasting conditions In 
clinical work therefore it is desirable to 
stimulate secretion by means of food which 
IS (he natural and most efficient stimulus 
before attempting to collect the gastnc 
contents Different foods and chemicals 
stimulate secretion to different degrees 
hence for the sake of uniform results cer 
tain standard test stimulants have been 
adopted It is customary to give the test 
meal in tbe morning since the stomach 
is most likely to be empty at that time 

Ewalds Test Ilrcakfast This test break 
fast consists of a roll or two slices of 
bread without butter and two small cups 
(300 to 400 ml ) of water or a similar 
amount of tea without cream or sugar 
The bread should be well masticated The 
gastric contents are removed one hour after 
ingestion of the meal This period should 
be calculated from the beginning of in 
gcsilon of the meal not from its comple- 
tion The one disadvantage of this meal is 
that the bread contains a vanablc amount 
of lactic acid and numerous yeast cells 


A modified Ewald test breakfast consists 
of eight arrowroot cookies and two glasses 
(400 ml ) of water This meal is extremely 
satisfactory and is used in most gastnc 
laboratones 

Clinical evaluation This is a simple 
physiologic meal given routinely in most 
laboratones 

Ricgcls Test Meal This test meal con 
sists of 400 ml of bouillon 150 to 200 
gm of broiled beefsteak and 150 gm of 
mashed potatoes The meal should be 
thoroughly masticated for it has a tend 
ency to clog the gastnc tube 

Clinical eialuation This meal is physi 
ologic but difficult to standardize complctclv 
It IS seldom used as a routmc test 
/Vlcohol Alcohol may be used to stim 
ulate gastnc secretion A total of 50 ml of 
a 7 per cent solution of ethyl alcohol is 
instilled into the stomach by means of a 
small stomach tube Aspirate the stomach 
in a fasting state at 5 minute Intenals for 
15 minutes before feeding the alcohol and 
afterward at 10 or 15 minute intervals 
for one hour saving a 10 ml portion for 
testing and then returning the remainder 
to the stomach Each sample is examined 
grossly measured and titrated A cunc is 
usually plotted showing the volume and 
titratable acidity for each period 

Clinical evaluation This test is simple 
to perform but is not physiologic The stim 
ulus probably is that of irritation of the 
gastnc mucosa with liberation of histamine 
v^Imaminc Histamine hydrochloride or 
preferably histamine phosphate is admin 
istered hypodermically after the patient has 
fasted for at least 12 hours The dose 
originally advised namely 0 1 mg for each 
10 kg of body weight may cause a dis 
agreeable reaction Gomperiz and Cohen 
(1929) have shown that a total dose of 
0 25 mg of histamine may be used sat 
isfactorUy The dose given Is for histamine 
Itself the actual dose of histamine phos 
phatc that is administered is 0 19 mg ptr 
10 kg of body weight which is equivalent 
to 0 1 mg of histamine The reaction comes 
on rapidly Flushing of the face quicken 
ing of the pulse and at times phvsical 
discomfort result Caution must be exer 
clscd in the choice of patients who are 
given histamine and the tests should not 
be used routinely The aspirated secretion 
is measured and titrated in the usual man 
ner and the results are best recorded 
graphically by plotting curves 

Clinical eialuation This procedure Is 
not physiologic it has disagreeable side cl

fects and must be used wth caution This is 
the test used to determine the stomachs 
capability for secreting hydrochloric acid 
for histamine is probably the most potent 
stimulant of gastric secretory function that 
IS available 

Augmented Histamine Test (Card 19o6 
Kay 1953) In an attempt to minimize the 
impediments inherent m the usual gastric 
analysis and to brmg some degree of quan 
titation into the procedure a technique has 
been evolved for the assay of the activity 
of parietal cells based on the use of a 
maximal stimulus from a large dose of his 
tamine Protection against the systemic ef 
feet of histamine is afforded by the pre 
bminary admimstrabon of an antihista 
mime preparation 

In this procedure the secretion of by 
drochJonc acid in normal and pathologic 
states is not augmented by proportion 
atelj larger doses of histamine Thus it is 
mferred that all the parietal cells are 
maximally stimulated Preliminary studies 
indicate that the results of these tests are 
reproducible m the same persons vvithin a 
5 per cent error 

Technique 

1 Place the patient m the left lateral 
decubitus position and localize the up of 
the tube roentgenographically in the so 
called residual pool just to the left of the 
vertebral column 

2 With a contmuous suction at a 
negauve pressure of less than 40 mm of 
mercury obtain a 45 minute basal coUec 
tion 

3 Inject intramuscularly 100 mg of 
pynlamine maleate (Neoantergan) to pro 
duce an antihistamine effect The gastuc 
jmee collected for the next 30 minutes is 
discarded 

4 Thirty minutes after injecUon of 
the antihistaminic mject histamine aad 
phosphate subcutaneously in a dose of 0 4 
mg per 10 kg of body weight 

5 Discarf the gastric contents col 
lected during the next 15 mmutes Titrate 
the collections for the subsequent 30 nun 
utes and express the values as milligrams 
of hydrochloric acid (maximal secretion) 

RestiUs The average basal secretion in 
normal persons is 72 mg of hydrochloric 
acid in patients with gastric ulcer the 
average isMlS mg and in patients with 
duodenal ulcer it is 265 mg The average 
maximal secreuon is 422 478 and 837 
mg in these three groups respectively 
Wide variation on either side of the mean 
values may be noted After gastric resec 


tion a reduction of the maximal secretion 
of acid to 23 per cent of the preoperative 
levels IS considered to indicate good sur 
gical results DifFicuUies in complete col 
lection from the stomach after operation 
make this phase of the test more difficult 
and probably less reliable than the pre 
operative phase 

Chntccl eialiiatton At the present time 
the mam field of usefulness for the aug 
mented histamme test appears to be m 
the expenmental physiologic laboratory 

Water Water done will stimulate the 
gastric mucosa and can be used as a test 
meal 

Chtncnl eialiiatmi It is a poor stim 
ulus and is not recommended 

Caffeine Caffeine m a dose of 0 2 gm 
m 200 ml of water may be mtroduced 
through the gastric tube as a test meal 
The test is accomplished in essentially the 
same manner as is the procedure usmg 
alcohol 

Cluneal eialuaftoti Jt is not physio 
logic It produces few side effects and is not 
so potent a secretory stimulus as is hista 
mine It is a satisfactory test but is not 
widely used 

Egg klbumin Heckmann (1933) used 
as a test meal 80 ml of freshly prepared 
egg albumin with 130 ml of distilled water 
to which 4 gm of Wittes peptone was 
added The mixture was stained with 2 
drops of a 2 per cent soUmon of methy 
lene blue heated to body temperature and 
filtered through gauze This fluid meal may 
be administered through a gastric tube 
and 10 ml portions of the gastnc contents 
may be removed it regular intervals for 
titration by the fractional method 

Clinical nalitatton This is a semiphy 
siologic but abnormal meal The liquid meal 
IS easy to administer but its preparauon is 
inconvenient for a busy laboratory and it 
IS rarely used 

Aloior Test Meal A meal containing a 
slice of toast beef a green vegetable (spm 
ach) a large servmg (1 tablespoonful) of 
raisins a piece of toast and regular or 
decaffeinated black coffee is serv ed at mid 
night Tlie paUent is instructed to cat the 
food slowly and to chew it well The pa 
Uent is not to eat or dnnk anything after 
the meal until the stomach is aspirated the 
following morning Aspirate the gastric 
contents determine the volume examine 
for particles of food (remnants of the test 
meal) and record the results Under nor 
mal conditions there usualh will be a 
volume of less than 100 ml and none of

Clinical etalnalion This is a physio 
logic test that frequently gues information 
relative to gastric empt^ng 
>^050110 Test (Hollander 1946) The 
mam purpose of the insulin test is to de 
termine the completeness and effectiveness 
with which the vagal innervation of the 
stomach has been destroyed by vagotomy 
The physiologic basis of the msuhn test 
Stems from the capacity of insulm to stim 
ulate both motor and secretory mech 
amsms in the stomach by way of the vagus 
nene Transection of ^ vagal fibers to 
the stomach will prevent the usual gastric 
responses to such stimulation The stim 
ulus to the vagal center in the brain is 
caused by the hypoglycemia induced by the 
insulin Unless the blood sugar is reduced 
to 50 mg or less per 100 ml a response 
will not be induced regardless of the dose 
of insulin If the level of blood sugar is 
maintained by givmg glucose or by the 
admimstration of epinephrine the insulin 
effect does not occur 
The insulin test is performed in the fol 
lowing manner (Hollander 1946) The 
fasting patient is brought to the laboratory 
and weighed accurately Tlie dose of in 
sulin (0 3 unit per kilogram of body 
weight) IS calculated and the matenal is 
placed in a sterile syringe preparatory to 
giving It intravenousl> In some labora 
tones a standard dose of 20 units of m 
subn IS used The gasme tube is passed 
and the stomach is emptied completely A 
sample of blood is obtained so that the 
baseline value for blood sugar can be meas 
ured a macromethod or preferably a 
micromelhod may be used for the blood 
sugar The insulm is injected intravenously 
thereafter every 15 minutes for the next 
90 minutes a sample of the gastnc con 
tents is aspirated and a sample of blood is 
drawn It is essential that the patient be 
instructed to expectorate all saliva for 
soon after the insulin is given th° patient 
will begin to sabvate and perspire It is 
important that a phjsician give the insulin 
and carefully watch the patient for any 
sign of a reaction 

At the conclusion of the test the physi 
\ Clan ma> give 50 ml of a 50 per cent 
solution of dextrose intravenously or if 
this is not deemed necessary the patient 
may be given a glass of orange juice or 
several lumps of sugar The amount of 
sugar in each sample of blood Is deter 
mined the volume of each sample of the 


gastnc contents is measured and each 
sample of gastric juice is titrated for free 
hydrochloric acid and total acids A time 
chart is prepared showing these various 
values If the level of sugar in any sample 
of blood IS 50 mg or less per 100 ml the 
stimulus of the insulm Is considered to 
have been adequate 

The lest is considered to give positive 
results if the values for free hvdrochloric 
acid and total acidity are greater than those 
obtained m the baselme sample This indi 
cates some intact vagal fibers Negative 
results occur when the values for free hy 
drochlonc acid and total acidity do not 
exceed those observed m the baseUne 
sample 

Some precautions are necessarv with 
this procedure It is important that the 
stomach be emptied completely at the time 
of the baseline aspiration and that the 
patient meticulously expectorate all sabva 
Atropine or similar parasympathetic agents 
should not be used for 24 hours prior to 
the test The gastnc aspiration must be 
done in such a way that neutrabzation of 
the gastnc juice from the intesunal con 
tents does not occur 

Clinical nalitnlion This is a practical 
and useful test for determining the com 
pleteness and effecuveness of vagotomy 
The performance of this test should be caie* 
fully supervised by a physician 
v/Noctumal 12 Hour Gastric \spiration 
It IS generally accepted that the human 
stomach even in the absence of food se- 
cretes its juices continually The volume 
and concentration of the acid vary greatly 
in different disease slates and even from 
hour to hour m the same person Gen 
erally this test is begun about 5 30 pm 
starting with the usual Ewald type of test 
meal and aspirating the stomach at the end 
of one hour This specimen is measured 
for volume and for concentration and out 
put of free hy drochlonc acid 

The gastnc tube is left in place for tbs 
next 12 hours Gentle continuous suction 
IS appUed to the tube At the end of the 
12 hour penod the total volume of gastric 
acid is measured as well as the concentra 
tion and output of free hydrochloric acid 
A cnticism of this test is that the stomach 
presumably is kept empty at all times Elx 
penmental evidence shows that the pres 
ence of acid in the antrum of the stomach 
has a tendency to reduce the gastnc scerc 
tion of acid On the other hand if suction 
were to be applied only at intervals some 
of the gastnc juice would escape into the 



Gastric and Duodenal Contents 599 


duodenum and thus a true 12 hour total 
secretion would not be obtained The lech 
niquc using continuous suction appears to 
be preferable 

Levin (1951) studied patients by means 
of this 12 hour nocturnal continuous 
suction method and found sigmficant dif 
ferences between normal persons and pa 
tients who had duodenal ulcer gaslnc 
ulcer or gastric carcinoma The volume 
concentration and output of acid were 
greatest m patients with duodenal ulcer 
No significant difference was noted be 
tween the volume of gastric secretion of 
normal persons and that of patients with 
gastnc ulcer but the output of acid tended 
to be less in the latter The lowest se 
cretory rate occurred m gastnc carcinoma 
Cluneal evaluatwii This test is disagree 
able for the tube must be left in all mght 
It probably does not represent normal 
physiologic conditions but often gives valu 
able information concerning the total long 
term secretion of the stomach 

Tubeless Gastric Analysis An indirect 
method of detecting the presence of free 
hydrochloric acid has been accomplished by 
the so called tubeless gastric analysis The 
first practical method for estimating the 
gastric acidity without use of the gastnc 
tube was introduced in 1950 by Segal and 
associates Initially a quinine resin com 
pound was employed as an indicator but 
more recent investigations haie dealt with 
dye resin compounds On e such^c ompound 
consists of a carboxybe acid cation-ex 
change resin in which hydrogen cations 
have been replaced by dye cations (azure 
A) In the presence of dilute hydrochloric 
acid the dye citiens are displaced by the 
hydrogen cations of free hydrochloric acid 
Significant replacement of the dye cations 
occurs in the lower range of pH (less than 
3) with maximal displacement at pH 1 5 
The released dye cations are absorbed from 
the small intestine and excreted in the 
urine where the discoloration from the dye 
is readily recogmzed 

Technique 

1 Breakfast is withheld and the In 
itial morning specimen of urine is dis 
carded 

2 A gastnc stimulant (usually 500 
mg of caffeine sodium benzoate) is taken

one hour to serve as the control sample 

4 The dye resin compound is taken 


orally again with a sufficient amount of

5 Two hours later the bladder is 
emptied and the entire specimen of unne 
is saved for analysis 

6 The two-hour specimen Is then 
compared with a known standard The re 
suits of this companson may denote either 
the absence of detectable amounts of dye 
indicating that free hydrochloric acid was 
not secreted or the presence of dye sig 
rufying the presence of free hydrochloric 
acid Some gross quantitation of the 
amount of free hydrochlonc acid may be 
ascertained from the concentration of the 
dye in the urine An overall correlation of 
95 per cent is claimed with the gastric 
tube method 

Chntcnl evaUialion This procedure 
avoids the discomfort associated with pas 
sage of a gastric tube and appears to have 
a high degree of correlation with methods 
employing direct aspiration of gastnc con 
tents Both falsely positive and falsely nega 
tive results have been reported The sim 
pbcit} of the test makes it well suited for 
mass screening studies for achlorhydria 
Its disadvantages include the time factor 
involved and unless the procedure is done 
under close supervision the complete de 
pendence on the accuracy of the patient in 
carrying out instructions Other informa 
tion that may be obtained by use of the 
gastnc tube such as the presence of blood 
particles of food or a large residual volume 
of gastric juice is of course unavailable by 
this method The accuracy of the test may 
be dimimshed in the presence of pyloric 
obstruction impairment of absorption in 
the small imestine hepatic disease and 
decreased renal function

Chemical Cxatmnattoii of the Gastric 
Contents 

A routine chemical examination of the 
gastric contents imolves qualitative tests 
for free hydrochlone acid and organic acids 
and the quantitative estimation of total 
aadity free hydrochloric acid and some 
times combined hydrochlone acid Other 


tests are applied when indicated In the 
routine examination qualitative tests are 
performed before quantitative tests 

/'Qualitative Tests 

Free Acids The presence or absence of 
free aads without reference to the kind is 
determined easily by the use of Congo red 
although this test is not much used in prac 
tice A thick piece of filter paper that has 
been soaked in a solution of Congo red 
dned and cut into stnps may be used 
/Free Hydrochloric ictd 
Dimethylamino Azobenzene Test 
Reagent 

AOS per cent alcoholic solution of 
dimethylammo azobenzene 
Technique 

To a small amount of the filtered gas 
tne juice in a test tube or to a few drops 
in a porcelain dish add a drop of the 
reagent If free hydrochlone acid is pres 
ent a cherry red color appears at once 
The intensity of color vanes with the 
amount of acid present (Fig 14 1 a) 
Although this test is extremely delicate 
organic acids will produce a similar reac 
uon when they are present m large 
amounts (more than 0 5 per cent) The 
color produced by organic acids however 
tends to be orange red instead of cherry 
red 

/Guenzburc s Test This test is less deli 
cate than the dimetliylamlno azobenzene 
test but It is more reUable because the re- 
agent reacts only with free hydrochlone 
acid 

Reagent 

Dissolve 2 gm of *phIoroglucm and 1 
gm of vanillin in 30 ml of absolute 
alcohol This reagent should be freshly 
prepared 
Tiec/inique 

Mix a few drops of the reagent with 
an equal amount of gastnc juice Slowly 
evaporate to dryness over a flame taking 
care not to scorch the mixture The appear 
ance of a rose red color indicates the pres 
ence of free hydrochlone acid If only a 
yellow stain is produced the reaction is 
negative (Fig 14—1 d and e) 

Ot^nsc Acids 

yLactic Acid Lacuc acid is the common 

est organic acid and is considered to be tvpi 
cal of the organic acids that appear m the

acetic or butyric acid rarely are performed 
When these acids are abundant they may 
be recognized by their odor on heating 
Butyric acid gues the odor of rancid but

present early in digestion it disappears 
when free hydrochlonc acid begins to ap 
pear Small amounts may be introduce

2 To a second tube transfer 2 5 ml 
of the resulting solution which is to be 
used as a control Add a few drops of the 
lactic acid drop by drop until the amethyst 
blue solution becomes canary yellow 

3 To the other tube add filtered gas 
tnc juice drop by drop If the color changes 
to match exactly the color of the control 
tube lactic acid is present 

Simon s Modification of Celling s 
Test To a test tube of distilled water add 
a sufficient amount of a 10 per cent solu 
tion of feme chloride to give a faint yel 
lowish tinge Pour half of this into a second 
test tube to serve as a control To the other 
tube add a small amount of gastric juice 
Lactic acid gi\es a distinct yellow color 
that IS readily recogmzed by comparison 
v/ith the control The color is seen best 
when the tubes are viewed from above over 
a sheet of paper 

Strauss s Test This is a good test 
for clinical work since it gives a rough 
idea of the quantity of lactic acid present 
and IS not sufHciently sensitue to respond 
to the traces of lactic acid introduced by 
some test meals Strauss s instrument (Fig 
14-2) IS essentially a separatory funnel mth 
a mark at 5 ml (cem ) and one at 25 ml Fill 
to the 5 ml mark with filtered gastnc juice 
and to the 25 ml mark with ether Shake 
thoroughly for 10 or 15 minutes let stand 
until the ether separates and then by 
opening the stopcock allow the gastnc 
juice to run out Fill to the 25 ml mark

Pepsin and Pepsinogen Pepsinogen itself 
has no digesuve power It is secreted fay the 
gastnc glands and is transformed into pep- 
sin by the action of a free acid Although 
pepsin digests proteins best in the presence 
of free hydrochlonc acid it has a sbght 
digestive activity m the presence of orgarac 
acids or combined hydrochlonc acid Pe|>- 
sin IS rarely or never absent in the pres 
ence of free hydrochloric acid Tests for 
pepsin are rarely necessary 

Rennin Rcnmn is the milk-curdlmg fer 
ment of the gastnc juice It is denved from 
renmnogen through the action of hydro- 
chlonc acid Deficiency of rennin has the 
same significance as does deficiency of pep- 
sin and It IS recognized more easily A 
test for rennin is not necessary unless free 
hydrochlonc acid is absent Absence of 
both free hydrochlonc acid and renmn may 
indicate achylia 

Test for rennw Add 5 drops of filtered 
gastnc juice to a test tube containing 5 
ml of fresh milk and place it m an in 
cubator or m a vessel of water at about 
40® C Coagulation of the milk in 10 or 
15 minutes indicates that a normal amount 
of renmn is present in the gastnc juice 

Blood Blood IS present m the vonutus 
in many pathologic conditions When it is 
noted in the gastnc contents removed after 
administration of a test meal it should 
cause one to suspect the presence of gastnc 
ulcer or caremoma Blood can be found hi 
the gastnc contents in nearly half of all 
cases of caremoma of the stomach tVhen 
blood IS present it is necessary to exclude 
the possibihty that it might have been 
swallowed or that it might have resulted 
from injury to the stomach by the stem

Reagents 

a Indicator This consists of a 1 per 
cent alcoholic solution of phenolphtha 
lein 

b Dccinormal solution of sodium by 
droxide The physician will find it ad 
Msable to have this solution prepared 
by a chemist or to purchase it from a 
chemical supply house 
Technique 

1 In an evaporating dish or small 
beaker place 10 ml of the filtered gastnc 
contents and add 3 or 4 drops of the in 
dicator When only a small quantity of 
gastnc juice is available 5 ml may be 
used for this test but the result will not 
be so accurate as that obtained with 10 ml 

2 Add the decinormal solution of so 
dium liydroxide drop by drop from a buret 
until the gastnc juice assumes a rose red 
color that does not become deeper on the 
addition of another drop of the solution 
(Fig 14-3 B and B ) Most workers accept 
the first appearance of a permanent pink 
as the endpoint just as they do in titrating 
other fluids with phenolphihalein as an 
indicator Owing to the interaction of phos 
phates it is advisable to carry the titration 
of gastnc juice a little further as here 
indicated When this point is reached all 
the acid has been neutralized The end 
reaction will be sharper if the fluid is 
saturated with sodium chlonde A sheet of 


white paper beneath the beaker facilitates 
recognition of the change in color 

Calculation In clinical work the 
aadity is expressed by the number of milli 
liters of the decinormal solution of sodium 
hydroxide that would be required to neu 
tralize 100 ml of the gastnc juice each 
milliliter representing 1 degree or unit of 
acidity Hence multiply the number of 
milliliters of the sodium hydroxide solution 
required to neutralize 10 ml of gastnc 
fluid by 10 which gives the degrees or 
uiuts of acidity The acidity may be ex 
pressed in terms of hydrochloric acid if 
one remembers that each degree or umt is 
equivalent to 0 00365 gm of hydrochloric 
acid Someone has suggested that 365 is 
the number of days in ^e year and that the 
lasi figure namely 5 indicates the number 
of decimal places making a convenient 
way to remember this figure 

Example Suppose that 7 ml of decinor 
mal solution is required to bnng about the 
end reaction in 10 ml of gastric juice 
then 7 x 10 s 70 degrees or umts of 
acidity expressed m terms of hydrochlonc 
acid 70 X 0 00365 = 0 255 per cent 
’'Tree Hydrochloric Acid In gastnc juice 
that has been obtained after administration 
of an Ewald test breakfast the normal 
value for the free hydrochlonc acid as de 
termmed by the method of Topfer is 20 
to 40 degrees which is equivalent to a 
0 1 to 0 2 per cent concentration of hydro 
chloric acid In the presence of disease 
the Value may be considerably higher or 
free hydrochloric acid may be absent en

Technique 

1 Place 10 ml of filtered gastnc 
juice in a beaker and add 4 drops of the 
indicator 

2 Titrate with the decmormal solu 
tion of sodium hydroxide until the appear 
ance of a violet color that has a slightly 
bluish tinge The titration should be con 
tinned until the color does not become 
deeper on the addition of another drop of 
sodium hydroxide It is difficult without 
practice to determine when the right color 
has been reached The color that determines 
the endpoint is not always the same there 
fore it IS better to watch for a change of 
color than it is to try to obtain the correct 
shade The shade that denotes the endpoint 
can be duplicated approximately by adding 
2 or 3 drops of the indicator to 5 ml of a 
1 per cent solution of sodium carbonate 
(Fig 14-3 C and C') 

Calculation Calculate the number 
of milliliters of decmormil solution of so 
dium hydroxide that nould be required to 
neutralize 100 ml of gastric juice This 
gives in degrees the value for all the acidity 
except that owing to combined hjdrocblonc 
aad The value for the combined hydro- 
chloric acid can be obtained by deducting 
this amount from the total acidity which 
has been determined previously 

Example Suppose that 5 ml of decinor 
mal solution of sodium hydroxide was re 
quired to produce the purple color in 10 
ml of gastric juice then 5 X 10 = 50 


which represents all the acidity except tint 
owing to combined hydrochloric acid Sup 
pose now that the total acidity already has 
been found to be 70 degrees or units then 
70 — 50 = 20 degrees or units of combined 
hydrochloric acid and 20 X 0 00365 = 

0 073 per cent 

Vcicl Deficit When free hydrochloric acid 
is absent it is probably more helpful to 
estimate the deficit of acid than to deter 
mine the value for the combined hydro 
chlonc acid The deficit of acid shows how 
far the acid secreted by the stomach falls 
short of saturating the protein (and bases) 
of the meal It represents the amount of 
hydrochloric acid that must be added to 
the fluid before the presence of free hydro- 
chlonc acid becomes apparent It is deter 
mined by titrating with decmormal solution 
of hydrochloric acid using dimclhylamino- 
azobenzene as an indicator until the fluid 
assumes a red color The deficit is expressed 
by the number of milliliters of the solution 
of hydrochloric acid required for 100 ml of 
the stomach fluid This test is of little 
practical significance 

Organic Acids There is no simple direct 
method for determining the amount of or 
game acids After the total acidity has been 
measured the organic acids may be rc 
moved from another portion of the gastric 
filtrate by shaking thoroughly with an equal 
volume of neutral ether allowing the fluids 
to separate and repealing this process until 
the gastnc juice has been extracted with 
eight Or ten times its volume of ether The 
total acidity then is determined and the 
difference between the two measurements 
indicates the amount of organic acids 

Hydrogen Ion Concenirition The hydro 
gen ion concentration may be determined 
by using standard buffer solutions or by 
comparison with the color chart that is now 
generally employed The range will be from 

1 05 to 7 true “anacidity” with a pH of 7 
is a rare condition The indicators to be 
used and the range of pH of each arc as 
follows thymol blue 1 2 to 2 8 bromo 
phenol blue 3 to 4 6 methyl red 4 4 to G 
btomctesol purple 5 2 to 6 8 bromothyanol 
blue 6 to 7 6 and phenol rod 6 8 to 8 4

titativc determination of pepsin is simple 
enough for routine use The following

seen The nuclei appear as small highly 
tefractile bodies Ijmg in clusters of two 
three or four Swallowed sputum always 
must be considered as a source of these 
corpuscles 

Sarcinae These are small spheres ar 
ranged in cuboid groups which ohen are 
compared with bales of cotton They fre 
quently form large clumps and are easil) 
recognized They stain brown with a solu 
tion of iodine They sigmfy fermentation 
but their presence is of little or no diag 
nosuc importance 

^ east Cells As already noted a few yeast 
cells may be found under normal condi 
tions The presence of considerable num 
bets IS evidence of retention and fermenta 
UoD They sfain yeWow to broivn wdth a 
solution of iodine 

Bacteria Numerous bacteria may be 
found in the gastnc juice especially ui the 
absence of free hydrochloric acid 

LoclolaciUtts of BoasOl>ller The lac 
tobacillus of Boas Oppler which probably 
is identical ^vith LactohaciUtis acidophilus 
or L bi Iganciis is of special significance 
when found in the gastric contents It is 
said to occur in cases of extensive car 
clnoma of the stomach Carcinoma prob 
ably furnishes a favorable medium for its 
growth 

The b'lcilb (Fig 14-4) are large (5 to 
10 microns long) and nonmotile usually 
being arranged in clumps or end to end in 
zigzag chains Tliey stain yellow or brown 
wth a solution of iodine The lactobacUlus 
of Boas Oppler is gram positiie Although 
it IS easily seen with the 4 mm objectue 
in unstained specimens it is best recog 


nized in fixed smears that have been 
stained with a simple bacterial stain or by 
Grams method The stained smears should 
be examined with the oil mimersion ob 
jective 

Bacteriologic examination frequently dis 
closes a few large nonmotile baciUi that 
arc mistaken for the lactobaciUus of Boas 
Oppler The presence of Boas*Oppler organ 
isms should not be reported unless the 
bacilU are arranged m clumps or end to 
end m chains 

v^Mycobactcniim tuberculosis In cases 
of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis in 
ivhich acid fast bacilli are not found in the 
sputum It is often helpful to culture the 
gastric contents for the presence of Afyco 
bacterium tuberculosis 

Method of Foley ahd Andosca 
Foley and Andosca (1943) described a sat 
isfactory method that utilizes the concen 
tration technique of Hanlvs and associates 
(1938) 

Apparatus 

1 An all glass Luer type of syringe 

2 A Le\in or Sa\\’yer tube The tube 
must be prepared carefully Wash it with 
hot water and soap and then run tap water 
through it for 30 minutes Boil the tube in 
a weak solution of sodium carbonate for 
30 minutes and then place it in tlie re 
fngerator o\emight 

Reagents 

a Digester Make a solution contain 
ing I pet cent of sodium hydroxide 0 2 
per cent of potassium alum and 0 002 per 
cent of bromothymol blue 

b An approximately 2 5 N solution of 
hydrochloric acid (25 per cent of concen 
trated hydrochloric acid by xolume) 



G08 Clinical Diagnosis bs 

c A 1 per cent solution of feme 
chloride In distilled water 

Technique 

1 The gastric contents should be re 
moved early in the morning before the pa 
tient has had breakfast Pass the lube 
nasally into the stomach Aspirate 30 to 
50 ml of gastric contents with the Luer 
syringe Great caution must be exercised in 
handling the aspirated gastric contents and 
the containers tube and syringe 

2 Mix 5 ml of the aspirated gastric 
contents with an equal volume of the di 
gestor Place the mixture in a water bath 
at 37° C for 30 minutes and shake oc 
casionally 

3 Add the 2 5 N solution of hydro- 
chloric acid drop by drop while shaking 
until the color of the indicator denotes 
approximate neutrality 

4 Shake for 30 seconds If floccula 
tion does not occur in less than five mm 
utes add 0 2 ml of the feme chlonde 
solution and shake again 

5 Centrifuge the flocculated sample 
for five minutes at high speed to pack the 
sediment 

6 Discard the supernatant fluid and 
transfer the sediment to mediums suitable 
for the culuvation of tubercle bacilli Prep- 
aration of stained smears of gastnc con 
tents for acid fast bacilli is not rccom 
mended because of the common occurrence 
of saprophytic acid fast bactena 

7 The sediment also may be used to 
inoculate guinea pigs 

'^The Gnstnc Contents in Disease 
In the diagnosis of gastnc disorders the 
physician must be cautioned against re 
lying too much on the results of cxamina 
tion of the gastnc contents Even when 
repeated studies are made the laboratory 
findings never should be considered apart 
from the clinical findings 

Gastric Olistruction Evidence of reten 
tion and fermentation is the chief charac 
teristic of this condition The concentration 
of hydrochloric acid is commonly dimln 
ishcd The value for pepsin may be normal 
or slightly diminished Lactic acid may be 
detected in small amounts but it is usu 
ally absent when the stomach has been 
washed before the test meal is given Both 
motiluv and the absorptive power arc de 
ficient Microscopic examination commonly 
discloses sarcime bactena and great num 
bers of yeast cells Remna nts of food from 
previous meals can be~3ctected with the 
naked eye or microscopicallv 


Laboratorv Methods 

■Chronic Gastritis There is no character 
istic pattern of gastric secretory activity in 
this ill-defined clinical syndrome Jt is /re 
quently stated that the amount of free 
hydrochlonc acid may be normal or In 
creased in the early stages of chronic gas 
tntis whereas it may be decreased or 
absent in the late stages The values for 
pepsin and rennin often are diminished in 
cases in which the disease is well developed 
Mucus frequently is present Gastnc rno- 
tilitv and absorption generally are deficient 

v' Achylia Ga^tnca (\iropluc Gastritw) 
This condition may be a terminal stage of 
chronic gastntis Sometimes it is associated 
with a blood picture similar to that of 
permcious anemia The hydrochlonc acid 
alid (ne gaslnc^Terments are decreased in 
amount and sometimes are absent The 
value for the total acidity may be as low 
as 1 or 2 degrees when determined by the 
method of Topfer Small amounts of lactic 
aci d may be present Gastric absorption 
and motihty are not greatly affccied 
Achylia is not considered so significant as 
it formerly was thought to be It may be 
present in apparently healthy persons 

Carcinoma of the Stomach In many in 
stances of gastnc caremoma the gastric 
contents are not significantly altered There 
IS however ample evidence of an increased 
incidence of gastnc carcinoma associated 
with lovT gastric acidity or anaciditv Die 
frequent relationship of “hy^aciditv and 
caranoma of the stomach has led to the 
hope that some simple screening test such 
as tubeless gastnc analysis may be useful 
in the mass detection of early carcinoma 
Recent techniques have made it possible 
to obtain freshly desquamated gastric cells 
for cvtologic_study and thus It is hoped 
that the early diagnosis of small malignant 
gastnc lesions will be possible Unfortu 
nately many carcinomas of the stomach arc 
far advanced when the first symptoms be- 
come evident The results of the gastric 
analysis should be considered only in con 
junction with the clinical and roentgen 
ologic findings 

Chemical examination discloses blood m 
the gastric contents in neirlv half ““ 
cases of gastric carcinoma Qccvilul’^o°“ ** 
present in the stools in nearly everv in

^Gastnc Ulcer In some cases of gastric 
ulcer the concentration of free hydro- 
chloric a^id is increased in most 
however il is normal or decreased

Gastcic and Duodenal Contents 


in some cases however, it occurs only in 
termittently The diagnosis must be made 
chiefly on the basis of the clinical and 
roentgenologic findings 
'^Duodenal Ulcer Classically, duodenal 
ulcer is associated ivith hyperacidity and 
an increased \ olume of gastric secretion 
In some cases "however the gastnc acidity 
IS normal or even low It is doubtful that 
an active duodenal ulcer is ever present in 
the absence of free hydrochloric acid As 
in gastnc ulcer the results of gastnc anal 
ysis should be considered only as an ad 
junct to the climcal and roentgenologic 
findings 

-^Pernicious Anemia For practical pur 
poses pernicious anemi^ always is associ 
ated with achlorhydria even a fter use of 
histamine as a stirruilant As is true of 
other caused of ^chloniydna there appears 
to be an mcreased incidence of carcinoma 
of the stomach associated with permcious 
anemia 

EXAMIN VTION OF DUODENAL 
CONTENTS 

Wtlhdraual of the Duodenal Coitteuts 
The duodenal contents may be with 
drawn by means of one of the gastric tubes 
previously described or by some modiflca 
tion of these tubes (Fig 14-5) The tubes 
usually are marked with a series of rings 
to indicate the distances from the mcisor 
• teeth to the cardia pylorus and duodenum 
It IS advantageous to attach a small glass 
tube to the proximal end of the rubber tube 
and to attach a short piece of rubber tub- 
ing to the proximal end of the glass tube 
The glass tube serves as a window and 
the small piece of rubber tubing serves 
for the attachment of the synnge A tube 


was first demonstrated by Einhom m 1909 
Many modifications notably those of Jutte 
and of Rehfuss have appeared these differ 
chiefly m the shape and weight of the 
metal Up and m the arrangement of the 
perforations The Jutte tube has a wire 
stylet that facihtates introducUon of the 
tube as far as the stomach 

When chief interest centers in the pan 
creatjc ferments it may be well to ghe the 
patient a cup of bouillon 30 minutes be 
fore the tube is to be introduced or 
dmanly, however a test meal is not given 
The patient should abstain from food for 
about 12 hours prior to the test and should 
fake only occasional sips of vvater The 
tube IS introduced mto the stomach m the 
manner already descnbed for the gastnc 
tube The patient then is placed on his 
right side with the hips elevated 15 or 20 
cm (6 or 8 inches) The movements of 
tlie stomach aided by gravity carry the 
up of the tube through the pylorus into 
the duodenum usually within 30 to 45 
minutes 

Fluid should begin to dnp from the free 
end of the tube soon after the tip has 
reached the stomach IF it does not do so 
siphonage should be started by injecting i 
few milliliters of warm water It is well to 
wash the stomach out with warm water 
injected and withdrawn by means of an 
all glass synnge Leave the tube m post 
tion and start siphonage Advance the tube 
slowly 2 5 cm (I inch ) at a Ume at ten 
minute intervals until the tube reaches a 
position such that the incisor teeth ire 
about midway between the second and 
third marks on the tube the tube 

enters the duodenum the first fluid that 
appears may be turbid yellow, and icid in 
reaction ov^ng to the mixture of gastnc

Although an Emhom duodenal tube or 
j some modification of this tube is most 
commonly used a double barreled tube de- 
signed by Agren and Lagerlof (1936) is 
particularly useful m obtaining duodenal 
contents that are to be exammed for pan 
cxeaijc emyroes (Fig J4-6) One op enin g 
of the tube should he m the stomal and 
the other in the duodenum The terminal 


parts of both passages are perforated with 
small holes except for 10 cm of the duo- 
denal portion which is meant for the 
pylonc region The tube is so constructed 
that It passes easily through the pylorus 
and does not readily coil up in the stomach 
Its passage should not 1» forced at any 
time if any type of obstruction Is met be 
cause resistance will disappear in a few 
minutes if the patient is placed on his right 
side It may take from one to fiie hours for 
the msertion of this tube to the projKf

of the tube (Fig 14-7) Fluoroscopy may 
be used as an aid during manlpulauon of

Physical examination of Duodenal 
Contents 

Normally duodenal fluid is clear color 
less or light yellow distinctly viscid and 
sbghtly alkaline to litmus Admixture of 
acid gastric juice causes the duodenal fluid 
to become somewhat cloudy and opalescent 
Cloudiness caused by bacteria and pus cor 
puscles may be present m inflammation of 
the duodenum or biliary passages 

Chemical Examiiiation of Duodenal 
Contents 

rerments Absence of or great dimmu 
tion in one or all of the pancreatic fer 
ments namely amylase lipase and tryp 
sin indicates deficient pancreatic secre 
tion or occlusion of the pancreatic duct 
Their quantitative estimation in duodenal 
fluid yields much the same information as 
does their quantitative measurement in the 
feces but it is more rebable Pancreatic 
fluid from a fistulous tract may show little 
or no proteolytic activity The methods now 
considered to be most satisfactory are de 
scribed in Chapter 8 

Bilirubin There is generally a sufficient 
amount of unaltered bJe pigment to give 
the duodenal contents at least a tinge of 
yellow and the depth of color is a rough 
but useful guide to the amount of bile 
present despite the presence of a variable 
amount of urobilin The amount may be 
recorded as 1+ 2+ or 3+ indicating 
small moderate and excessive amounts 
respectively Sometunes the fluid is dark 
yellow brown or even chocolate brown 
The presence of bile rules out complete 
obstruction of the common bile duct Its 
absence means only that bile is not enter 
ing the duodenum at that time In jaun 
diced patients the repeated absence of bile 
in the material obtained during duodenal 
drainage suggests either complete obstruc 
tion of the common bile duct or more 
rarely a temporary cessation of the secre 
tion of bile by the liver 

Urobilin Urobilin is a reduction product 
of bilirubin Its nature and signifcance are 
considered in Chapter 11 A small amount of 
urobilin is present in the duodenal con 
tents normaUi however the chromogen 
urobilinogen is found only when an execs 
sive amount of urobilin is present 


The presence of urobilinogen and an in 
crease in the quantity of urobilm have the 
same significance as does an increase in 
the amount of these substances in the feces 
In each case certain theoretic and practical 
objections can be raised yet the qutntita 
tlve estimations of urobilin in feces and in 
duodenal contents appear to have about 
equal clinical value and the results con 
stitute an mdex of the actmty of destruc 
tion of blood These measurements are at 
times valuable m the diagnosis of the 
hemolytic anemias and they may be help 
ful m a study of anemia of doubtful origin 

A satisfactory clinical method for deter 
mining the amount of urobilin is that of 
Wilbur and Addis (1914) which Schnei 
der (1916) applied to the duodenal con 
tents as follows 

1 To 10 ml of duodenal contents add 
10 ml of a saturated alcoholic solution of 
zinc acetate Shake well and filter 

2 To 10 ml of the filtrate add 1 ml of 
Ehrlichs reagent (p 549) Mix and let 
stand in a dark place for 15 minutes 

3 Examine with a spectroscope and dilute 
with 60 per cent alcohol until the bands of 
both urobibn and urobilmogen hav'e disap 
peared Calculate the dilution value for 1000 
ml of duodenal contents remembering that 
the filtrate used represents 5 ml of duodenal 
fluid If for example the urobilin and the 
urobilinogen bands disappear when the 10 
ny] of fiJtraie is diluted to 80 and 40 mJ 
respectively the dilution value of 5 ml of 
duodena) fluid is 16 for urobilm and 8 for 
urobilinogen for 1000 ml it would be 200 
times as much or 3200 and 1600 respcc 
tlvely with a total dilution value of 4800 

Schneider found the maximum for 
healthy medical students to be about 1000 
dilutions with urobilinogen never present 
In pernicious anemia and hemolytic icterus 
urobilinogen is generally present and the 
total dilution value usually reaches 3000 to 
5000 More accurate methods for the deter 
mination of urobilinogen will be found In 
Chapter 11 

Microsco/nc Cxnrmnation of Duodenal 
Contents 

The duodenal fluid must be examined 
within a few minutes after it is secured 
otherwise the cellular elements may be 
damaged or destroyed by the ferments Tlu- 
meth^ is the same as that for fresh urine 
Normally only an occasional leukocyte or 
epithelial cell can be found In pathologic 
conditions such cells may be present in

increased numbers but definite diagnostic 
inferences cannot be drawn A great excess 
of pus corpuscles would suggest inflamma- 
tion of the duodenum or biliary tract 
Strongyloxdes stercorahs and Giardia lamb 
ha hate been found, sometimes in great 
numbers In cases in which cystic and 
vegetatne forms of Entamoeba histolytica 
are found. Infestation of the li^er or bUiary 
passages with these parasites may be in 
ferred 


Dactenologtc Examination oj Duodenal

At the present time extremely bale of 
clinical \aJue can be learned from a bac 
tenologic study of the duodenal contents 
Normally the duodenal fluid is sterile or 
contains only a few gram posime cocci 

EX.iMlN ITION OF FRESH BILE 

Magnesium sulfate appbed locally to the 
mucosa of the duodenum, makes it pos 
sibte to collect and segregate bile from the 
different parts of the bibary tract Cytologic 
and bactenologic study of bile obtained m 
this manner may y'leld information of \alue 
in the differential diagnosis of cbolecystms, 
cholelithiasis, and choledochitls 

The procedure may be outlmed as fol 
Ions Introduce about 50 ml of a sterile 
25 per cent saturated solution of mag 
nesium sulfate \ery slowly mto the duo- 
denum through a duodena! tube, which is 
left in place for three to five mmutes 
Siphon off the stimulant with tbe first 
sample of duodenal contents, which is dis 
carded Magnesium sulfate introduced di 
recUy into the duodenum appears to relax 
the sphincter of the common bile duct, 
thereby mducmg drainage of the entire 
bibary tract Equal parts of Phospho-Soda 
(Fleet) and water also make a sausfactoiy 
stimulant for the flow of bile The duodenal 
contents are siphoned into a senes of 
stenle bottles or large tubes Golden yellow 
bile from the common bile duct appears 
soon and is designated “A " This bile may 
appear without the use of a stimulant 
After a few minutes it rather suddenly 
gives place to a darker, more vascid bile, 
which IS supposed to come from the gall- 
bladder and which is designated “B " If 
this type of bile does not appear reasonably 
soon, repeat the sumulation or introduce 
warm water This portion usually amounts 
to 30 to 75 ml , and it is succeeded by a 
clear Ught yellow bile of low specific grav- 


ity, which IS assumed to be freshly se- 
creted bile from the hver and which is 
designated “C ” The vanous portions arc 
collected separately, and their color, vis 
cosity, turbidity, and general appearance, 
as well as tbe presence or absence of 
mucus, are noted They are also examined 
microscopically, chiefly for abnormal sedi 
ments, and culturally for bacteria 
Jones (1924) has showTi that in chol 
ebthiasis the sediment, after centrifugation 
at high speed contains charactenstic bile 
stained epithebum or leukocytes, choles- 
terol crystals, amoq;)hous yellow bihrubm, 
or darker yellowish brown crystals of cal 
cjum bilirubinate

Tlie Feces 


By BENJAMIN B WELLS, M D 


As commonly practiced an examination of 
the feces is limited to a search for intes 
unal parasites or ova Much of value can 
however be learned from other simple ex 
ammations particularly from careful m 
spection Anything approaching complete 
analysis is on the other hand a waste of 
time for the clinician 
The normal stool is a mixture of water 
undigested and indigestible remnants of 
food such as starch granules particles of 
meat and vegetable cells and fibers di 
gcsted foods excreted before absorption can 
tike place products of the digestive tract 
such as altered bile pigments enzymes and 
mucus products of decomposition such 
as indole skatole fatty acids and various 
gases epithelial cells shed from the wall 
of the intestinal canal and bacteria which 
are always present in enormous numbers 
In the presence of pathologic conditions 
abnormsd amounts of normal constituents 
blood pathogenic bacteria ammal para 
sues and their ova and biliary and intes 
tmal concretions may be present 

The stool to be examined should be 
passed into a clean vessel without admix 
ture of unne The examination should not 
be delayed more than a few hours to avoid 
the changes caused by decomposition No 
disinfectant should be used when search 
for amebae is to be made the vessel must 
be warm and the stool must be kept warm 
until examined In examining for protozoa 
a sahne cathartic should be given to in 
sure the passage of a watery stool A jar or 
bottle that is sent to the laboratory nearly 
full of feces should be opened with great 
care otherwise the gases that may have 
formed may force the fecal material out 


with a spurt and soil the hands More de 
tailed directions for the collection and 
preservation of feces wiU be found in Chap- 
ter 17 

M \CROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 

Quanta} The imount of feces vanes 
greatly with the diet and other factors 
The average amount is about 200 gm in 
24 hours but it may be much larger when 
a vegetable diet is being used 
Frcqucnc) One or two stools in 24 hours 
may be considered normal yet one in three 
or four days is common among healthy 
persons The individual habit should be 
considered in every case 
Form and Consistency Soft mushy 
liquid stools follow the administration of 
cathartics and accompany diarrhea Copl 
ous purely serous dischargeb without fecal 
matter are significant of Asiatic cholera 
although they are sometimes observed m 
other conditions Hard stools accompany 
constipation Rounded scybalous masses 
are common in habitual constipation and 
indicate atony of the muscular coat of the 
colon Flattened ribbon like stools result 
from obstruction in the rectum generally 
a tumor or a stneture 

Color The normal hghi or dark brown 
color is due chiefly to urobilin which is 
formed from bihrubin by reduction proc 
esses in the intestine largely the result of 
bactenal activity The stools of infants are 
yellow owing partly to their milk diet and 
partly to the presence of unchanged bill 
nibln 

Diet and drugs cause marked charges in 
the color of the stools Milk produces a

light yellow color; cocoa and chocolate, a 
dark gray; various fruits, a reddish or black 
color-, spinach, a dark green; and iron and 
bismuth, a dark brown or black. 

Pathologically the color is important. A 
golden yellow color is generally due to un- 
changed bilirubin. Green stools are not 
uncommon, especially in the diarrhea of 
childhood. They are sometimes passed by 
apparently healthy infants, they alternate 
with normal yellow stools and have little 
significance unless accompanied by symp- 
toms The color is due to bih\erdin or some- 
umes to chromogenic bacteria. Putty-col- 
ored or “acholic” stools occur when bile is 
deficient owing to obstruction of outflow or 
to deficient secretion. The color results less 
from the absence of bile pigments than 
from the presence of fat Similar stools, 
which have a greasy appearance and mani- 
festly consist largely of fat or its derivatives, 
are common in conditions like tuberculous 
penionitis, which interfere vnih absorption 
of fats, and in pancreatic disease 

Large amounts of blood produce tarry, 
black, usually viscid stools when the source 
of the hemonhage is in the stomach or 
upper part of the intestine and dark brown 
to bnght red stools if the source is nearer 
the rectum. When diarrhea exists, the color 
may be red, even if the source of the blood 
is high in the gastrointestinal tract. Ped 
streaks of blood on the outside of the stool 
are due to lesions of the rectum or anus. 
Amounts of blood too small for recognition 
by simple Inspection are designated occult 
blood and require chemical tests 

Odor. Products of decomposition, chiefly 
indole and skatole, are responsible for the 
normal offensive odor. The strength of this 
odor depends largely on the amount of meat 
in the diet and on the activity of putrefac- 
tive bacteria in the intestine. If a vegetable 
or milk diet is being used, the odor Is much 
less. A sour odor owing to fatty acids is 
normal for nursing infants and is noted In 
mild diarrhea of older children. In the 
severe diarrhea of childhood a putrid odor 
is common 

Muais. Excessive quantities of mucus 
arc easily detected with the naked eye and 
signify irritation or inflammation. When 
the mucus Is small in amount and inti- 
mately mixed with the stool, the lesion is 
probably in the small intestine. Larger 
amounts that are not well mixed with fecal 
mauer indicate inflammation of the large 
intestine. Stools composed almost wholly of 
mucus and streaked with blood arc the rule 


in dysentery, ileocolitis, and intussuscep- 
tion. 

In so-called mucous colic or membranous 
enteritis shreds and ribbons of altered 
mucus, sometimes representing complete 
casts of portions of the bowel, are passed, 
especially after an enema. In the ordinary, 
formed stool they usually pass unrecognized 
unless the feces is well mixed with water. 
These may appear as firm, irregularly seg- 
mented strands and may simulate tape- 
wonns. The mucus sometimes takes the 
form of brown or black, jelly-like masses.

CHEMICAL EXAMINATION 

Most chemical examinations of the feces 
are in the category of research technique 
and are neither available nor necessary for 
ordinary clinical work. Only a few simple 
observ'ations are usually made in the clin- 
ical laboiaiory. 

lifacthn 

This observation has little practical 
value. Normally the reaction Is either 
slightly acid or slightly alkaline. ^luch de- 
pends on the diet. Excess of carbohydrate 
produces acidity and excess of protein, al- 
kabnity. Pathologic variations occur in 
gastrointestinal disorders, but clinical cor- 
relations are of no great value. Indicator 
papers or other standard methods can be 
used to determine the hydrogen ion concen- 
tration. 

Fermentation 

Excessive carbohydrate fermentation, re- 
sulting from intestinal indigestion of carbo- 
hydrates, Is manifested by the formation of 
gas and by an acid reacUon. The stool Is 
usually soft and mushy, and bubbles of gas 
may present. The bubbles become much 
more evident after the stool has stood in a 
warm place for 12 hours. Then the stool, 
when stirred with a stick, gives a crackling 
sound. As the gas forms, the reaction be- 
comes Increasingly acid. A similar bulky, 
frothy stool, which has these characteristics 
when freshly passed, is typical of sprue. A 
normal stool contains few or no gas bubbles 
even after It has stood 24 hours. Special 
diets and special procedures for the dc- 
lerminatlon of gas formation, such as 
Schmidt's well-known test, may be em- 
ployed but usually are not necessary. 



The Feces 


615 


Intestinal indigestion of protein, on the 
other hand, is manifested by evidences of 
putrefaction, that is, foul-smelling stools, a 
strongly alkaline reaction, and little forma- 
tion of gas. 

Jitood 

IVhen present in large amounts, blood 
produces such marked changes in the ap- 
pearance of the stool that it is not likely to 
be overlooked. Traces of blood (occult 
Wood) can be detected only by special tests. 
Recognition of occult blood is most valuable 
m diagnosis of gastric carcinoma and ulcer. 
It is constantly present in practically every 
case of carcinoma of the stomach and is 
always present, although usually intermit- 
tently, in cases of active peptic ulcer. 
Traces of blood also accompany malignant 
disease of the bowel, the presence of cer- 
tain intestinal parasites, and ^ other path- 
ologic conditions. 

Detection of Ocailt Rlood. Tests for oc- 
cult blood are generally based on the capac- 
ity of hemoglobin and its derivatives to 
catalyze the oxidation of various chromo- 
genic substances. The most •Nvidely used 
test substances arc benzidine, guaiac, and 
OTthotolidin. The large number of sug- 
gested procedures represent minor varia- 
tions on this basic reaction, attempting to 
make the test sufficiently sensitive to detect 
the presence of blood while at the same 
time giving a minimum number of falsely 
positive reactions. None of the tests is en- 
tirely specific. SVhen the issue is important, 
the test should always be repeated on sev- 
eral occasions. To properly evaluate a posi- 
tive result, the patient must have been on 
a meat-free diet for three to six days. A 
positive result can be due to swallowed 
blood from the mouth or respiratory tract; 
these sources can usually be ruled out. A 
large amount of fat in the feces can inter- 
fere with the test reaction, but it is rarely, 
if ever, worthwhile to carry out an ether 
extraction of the feces. 

A test using gum guaiac as the indicator 
has been widely accepted and appears to 
give few false reactions. 

Reagents 

a. Hydrogen peroxide 3 per cent. 

b. Acetic acid, glacial reagent. 

c. Saturated solution of gum guaiac 
in 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. 

Teckniqzie 

1. A small bit of feces, usually ob- 
tained during digital examination of the 
rectum, is smeared on a piece of filter paper 
or ordinary blotting paper. 


2. To this add 1 drop of the guaiac 
solution. 1 drop of glacial acetic acid, and 
1 drop of hydrogen peroxide. 

A positive reaction is indicated by the 
appearance of a blue or dark green color 
within 30 seconds. Other colors or delayed 
reactions should be regarded as negative 
This same procedure using a saturated solu- 
tion of benzidine in glacial acetic acid in 
place of the guaiac preparation has also 
been widely recommended. Benzidine has 
the disadvantage of giving more false posi- 
tive reactions. 

Several commercial test preparations are 
now available for this test. The Hematest 
Reagent Tablets,* which use orthotolidin 
as the indicator, offer a convenient method 
for office or small laboratory units 

Bile 

Normally unaltered bile pigment is never 
present in the feces of adults. In inflam- 
matory conditions producing dianhea, it 
may be carried through unchanged The 
determination of bilirubin derivatives, uro- 
bilinogen and others, in the feces and the 
clinical significance of tests for these sub- 
stances are discussed in relation to hema- 
tology and liver function in other sections 
of this book. 

MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 

Care must be exercised in the selection 
of portions of the feces for microscopic ex- 
amination. A random search will often re- 
veal nothing of interest. Samples from 
several different portions of the specimen 
should be e.xamined even when the stool is 
apparently homogeneous. A small bit of the 
stool or any suspicious looking particle is 
placed on a slide, thinned with water if 
necessary, and covered with a coverglass. 
The layer should be just thin enough so 
(hat newsprint can be read through it when 
the slide is placed on the paper. A large 
slide — about 2 by 3 inches — with a cor- 
respondingly large coverglass will be found 
convenient. Most of the structures that one 
desires to see can be found with a 16 mm. 
objective. Details of structures must he 
studied with a high power objective. Since 
size js always an important consideration 
in the identification of microscopic struc- 
tures, partlculariy in the case of parasites 
and their ova, frequent use of the ocular 
micrometer is essential. Detailed studies of

digestion 

Body Cells A few epithelial cells derived 
from the wall of the alunentary canal are 
always present They show all stages of dis 
integration and are often unrecogmzable 
A marked excess in the number of these

a broad outline of FA techmques This Is

The basic principle on which fluorescent 
antibody fechniQues depend is the nature of 
the combination of specific antibody with 
antigen. In the direct method the antibody 
coats the antigen (bacteria and protozoa, 
for example) and cannot easily be temoved. 
If such an antibody has been rendered 
fluorescent by conjugation with fluorescein 
and all the nonantibody globulin is removed 
by washing, all that is left is that which is 
attached to the antigen. Thus. If the anti- 
gen is a bacterial cell and is viewed with 
an appropriate optical system, the fluores- 
cent outline of the bacterial cell can be 
seen easily. The specificity of the test, as 
in any serologic procedure, depends on 
tiie purity of the antibody In the conjugated 
scrum. To produce such a specific scrum, 
one can immunize an appropriate animal 
\siih an organism (antigen) and absorb 
the scnim to remove all but the specific, 
identifying antibody. For example, an ani- 
mal may be given a series of Inoculations 
with a suspension of Group A hemolytic 
SlrcptococcNs pyoqcncs and by appropriate 
absorption the cross-rcactlng antibodies 
can be removed. The absorbed scrum then 
contains specific Group A antibodies and 
when conjugated with fluorescein can be 
used to identify these organisms in smears. 

An Indirect FA technique may also be 
used. The basic principle of this method Is 
as follows: The specific antiserum Is not 
iafaefed with fluorescefn. ft fs allowed to 
react with the antigen and the nonanilbody 
globulin is washed off. If one Is using a 
rabbit antiserum, the antigen Is now coated 
with rabbit serum globulin. Treatment of 
this preparation with fluorescein-labeled 
antirabbit globulin results In a specific 
combination of this labeled antibody with 
the rabbit globulin already specjfically at- 
tached to the antigen. When the nonanti- 
body globulin is washed off, the antigen 
now can be seen as in the case of the 
direct technique. This indirect method lias 
the advantage of reducing the number of 
labeled antiserums nced^, since, if all 
diagnostic antiserums were produced in the 
rabbit, one would need only a fluorescein- 
labeled antirabbit globulin. Such a serum 
can be produced by inoculation of rabbit 
globulin Into a sheep or other suitable ani- 
mal. The indirect technique can be used 
for the detection of antibody in the serum 
of patients by combining such serum with 
specific organisms, such as Toxoplasma, 
and tiien using a fluorescein-labeled anti- 
human globulin serum. 

An mhibition method has been used also 


for the purpose of checking the specificity 
of file leactlons n’ith a given antigen- 
antibody system. This will be outlined later. 
There is also a complement staining 
method, which is at present rather com- 
■plex but may be quite useful in certain 
types of work. 

Use of Fluorescence .Microscopy as a 
DiagniKtic Tcchniniic in BaclerJology. The 
following is a brief history of the develop- 
ment of fluorescent antibody techniques 
and a general outline of the materials and 
methods now In use. More detailed discus- 
sions will be found In the references and 
in the current literature. 

Prior to the introduction of fluorescein 
Isothiocyanate the conversion of amino 
fluorescein to fluorescein isocyanate for 
labeling serum globulin was a task that 
presented a major obstacle to many lab- 
oratories. This conversion required the use 
•of phosgene gas. an extremely toxic re- 
agent, and therefore the number of lab- 
oratories with facilities necessary for pre- 
paring labeled antiserums was limited. In 
addition to the toxicity of phosgene gas, 
the fluorescein isocyanate was unstable and 
had to be prepared immediately before 
mixing with the serum globulin to be con- 
jugated. However, ^vitb the introduction of 
fluorescein isochiocyanate a stable reagent 
became available that greatly slmpbfied the 
entire procedure for conjugating this de- 
rivTitive of fluorescein to scrum globulin. 

Essentially the procedure being used at 
present by most workers involves using 
half-saturated ammonium sulfate for re- 
pealed precipitation of serum globulin, 
which contains the antibodies. The pre- 
cipitate is then dialyzed to remove the 
ammonium sulfate. The concentration of 
the precipitated globulm is usually adjusted 
to a Concentration of about 1.0 per cent, 
and a calculated amount (0.05 mg. per 
mg. of protein) of fluorescein isothiocy- 
anatc is added. This step is carried out at 
5® C., and the globubn-fluorescein isotbio- 
cyanate mixture is gently shaken for about 
18 hours at 5” C. 

After this the preparation is usually ab- 
sorbed with an aniomc resin to remove 
materials that are responsible for certain 
nonspecific staining. Originally pig liver 
powder or a like material prepared from 
other animal organs was used to absorb 
the conjugated globulin. However, these 
powder absorptions require a procedure 
that sometimes results in excessive dilution 
of the conjugated globulin. Unless speci- 
fied otherwise, most methods used at the

The three major techmques now m use 
are essentially as follows In the direct 
method smears of the material to be ex 
amined may be fixed with heat or raeth 
arrol or in some cases fixation is not 
necessary Then the smear is flooded with 
the conjugated globulm reagent contaimng 
a specific antibody This complex is usually 
incubated for 30 to 60 minutes at 37® C 
in a moist chamber Following this the 
smear is washed twice the first time in 
buffered saline for five to ten minutes and 
then m tap water for another five to ten 
minutes This washing is for the purpose 
of removing all uncombmed conjugated 
globulin A small drop of buffered glycerol 
IS placed on the smear and a coverslip is 
added The smear is then ready for ex 
amination 

In the indirect method the smear is 
treated with unlabeled anuserum exactly 
as in the direct test This is the primary 
combining reaction After this smear has 
been meubated and washed fluorescein 
labeled anuglobulm homologous to the 
globulin of the animal species whose scrum 
IS used m the primary reaction (eg if 
rabbit scrum was the primary reagent use 
labeled sheep antirabbit globulin) is added 
and the smear incubated and washed agam 
as m the primarv reaction The smear is 
ihen mounted in buffered glycerol and 
examined 

The inhibition test is used as a control 
for the specificity of a reaction In ibis test 
cuphcaie smears are used One smear is 
treated with a mixture of unlabeled ho- 
mologous antiserum and labeled homolo- 
gous anuserum The second smear is 
stained with a mixture of unlabeled nonnal 
scrum and labeled homologous anuserum 
Staining is earned out as m the direct test 
WTicn the stained smears are examined 
the first preparation (unlabeled homologous 
antiserum plus labeled homologous anti 


serum of the same species) should not 
fluoresce but the second smear (stained 
with normal scrum and labeled homologous 
anuserum of the same species) should 
fluoresce This technique may also be used 
to detect antibody m unknown (patients) 
serum It requires a great deal of standardi 
zauon and before one attempts to use this 
method it should be thoroughly understood 
The overall techmque is too lengthy for 
this presentation It is to be suspected that 
the direct and mdirect methods will be 
much more useful in the clinical laboratory 

As Fa vvork progresses the new appli 
cauons of this techmque that will no doubt 
evolve will make possible changes and re 
finements of present techmques Detection 
of antigen in tissues has been reported as 
well as the successful demonstration of

1&-2 and 16-3) It is also not possible to 
differentiate these organisms by gram stain 

The simplest way to differentiate be 
tween these organisms is to pick a colony

agar plate and apply an optochin disk * 
D pneumomae is inhibited by optochin 
(ethjihydrocupreme hydrochlonde) and a

may reveal such orgamsms and this find 
mg IS strongly suggestive (Fig 16-7) 

If cultures are inoculated by the pour 
plate method the hemolytic zones of beta 
streptococci are clearer One method is to 
add the inoculum to a tube containing 10 
ml of infusion broth One or two loopfuls 
are transferred to a sinulat second tube 
which IS shaken vigorously One miUihter 
IS then pipetted into a tube containing 20 
ml of mdted blood agar base which has 
been cooled to 45° C One miUilitet of sheep 
blood* IS then added and the mixture 
rotated and poured mto a Petn dish After 
sohdification the dish is incubated for 24 
to 48 hours and examined for beta he 
molytic colomes 

It IS important to determine the serologic 
group to which beta hemolytic streptococci 
Mtong since the presence of Group A 
streptococci ma> necessitate therapy other 
groups usually being Insignificant A simple 
procedure that is fairly accurate is to plate 
the streptococci on blood agar and to apply 
a bacitracin disct to the inoculated sur 
face A definite zone of mhibition of growth 
around the disc indicates presumptively 
that the organism belongs to Lancefield

Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods

Ophthalmological Society.) 

nique (see p. 899). These precipitation 
reactions depend on the presence of group 
specific polysaccharides, the C-substances. 

Staphylococcus aureus is easily identified 
when it is typical, producing its gold pig- 
ment and usually having a zone of beta 
hemolysis surrounding the colonies (Fig. 
16-8). Some strains do not hemolyze ^ 
types of blood and this must be kept in 
mind. The most reliable indicator of patho- 
genicity in S. aureus is considered to be 
the coagulase test, but unfortunately unless 
carefully standardized the test is subject 
to many sources of error. This test may be 
done as follows. 

1. Place 2 or 3 drops of an 18-hour broth 
culture of the S. aureus in a sterile test tube 
(10 X 100 mm.). One may use colonies 
from a plate by emulsifying a large loopful 
in 2 or 3 drops of broth. 

2. Add 0.5 ml. of plasma (human or 
rabbit) diluted 1:5 ivith physiologic saline 
and mix thoroughly by shaking. Desiccated 
or lyophilized plasma can be purchased for 
this purpose. 

3. Place the tube in a 37® C. water 
bath or incubator for three hours. ATost 
positive strains ivUl clot the plasma within 
one hour. Those not clotting at three hours 
are re-examined after incubation for an 
additional 18 hours. Any degree of clotting 
Is considered positive. 

Coagulase tests can also be done in plates 
containing fibrinogen (Bovine Fraction I) 
or plasma. Coagulase positive colonies pro- 
duce distinct zones of opacity after over- 
night incubation. 

Yet another method is the slide test for 
coagulase (Cadness-Graves, 1943), but 
this is useM primarily as a rough screen- 


ing procedure. Place a small drop of water 
on a slide and emulsify organisms from a 
single colony in it. Then add a small drop 
of plasma and mix thoroughly. If clumping 
of the organisms occurs in 5 to 15 sec- 
onds, the test is positive. If no clumping 
occurs, the organism should be tested by 
one of the other procedures. This test meas- 
ures “bound” rather than “free” coagulase. 

It has been found recently that estima- 
tion of deoxyribonuclease actiiity of staphj- 
lococci is considerably easier, more eco- 
nomical, and probably a better indication 
of potential pathogenicity than is the coag- 
ulase test. Details of this test may be found 
in the article by Weekman and Catlin 
(1957). 

Another useful test Is the estimation of 
phosphatase activity. This is accomplished 
by adding 0 01 per cent phenolphthalein 
phosphate to melted blood agar base- Swabs 
are plated in the usual way. After over- 
night incubation the plate is exposed to 
the fumes from a bottle of concentrated 
ammonia. Phosphatase positive colonies 
turn bright pink, while others remain un- 
clianged. This test correlates very well tvith 
the coagulase and deoxyribonuclease ac- 
tivity. 

Many other tests for determination of the 
potential virulence or pathogenicity of 
staphylococci are available. Most of these 
reactions aie impractical for the clinical 
laboratory. Details of these reactions may 
be found in tlie references.

eggs) 

4. Alpha hemolysin 

5. Leukocidm production 

6 Necrotoxin production 

7 Virulence in rabbits or mice 

8. Ammonium molybdate chemical test (A.M C.) 

Another reaction, particularly useful in 
identifying enterotoxigenic food poisoning 
strains of S. aureus, mvolves the capacity 
of the organisms to ferment mannitol and 
lo propagate in the presence of 7.5 per 
cent NaCl. These tests can be run simul- 
taneously in mannitol-salt agar. 

All staphylococci that axe coagulase neg- 
ative may be considered as Staphylococetts 
epidermidis. These are not typable ^'itn 
bacteriophage and are usually, but not al- 
ways, nonpathogenic. 

The emergence of considerable numbers 
of antibiotic resistant strains of S. aureus, 
especially in the hospital environment, has 
created a serious problem. It is important 
that antibiotic sensitivity tests be done on

tients in order to guide therapy Precautions 
must be taXen to a^oid transmission of the

(See Chapter 22 ) 

S aureus is antigemcall> rather heterog 
enous although certain definite antigen 
types have been descnbed A more work 
able classification is obtained by means of 
bacteriophage typing This procedure has 
considerable usefulness in epidemiologic 
studies but should probably not be at 
tempted m small laboratories and at least 
at present does not contnbute greatlj to 
diagnosis 

THE GRAM ^EGVTI^E COCCI

All Neissena are » oxidase positive but 
there are certain other microorganisms that 
are also positive (certam of the gram neg

O and Vi sera will allow satisfactory idcn 
ufication of most of the strains of Sal 
monella found in human disease 
Specific agglutinauon of suspected S 
typhi requires special comment Freshly 
isolated strains often have VI antigen, and 
such organisms may not agglutinate wth 
the S tijpJii antiserum One can obtain 
specific anti Vi sera and, if available, this 
should be used If such sera arc not avail 
able, the Vi antigen can be destrojed by 
placing tlie suspension of the bacteria in 
a boiling water bath for 10 to IS minutes 
Following this the organism should ag 


glutlnatc with the routine anti S typJii 
scrum. 

To establish an exact identification of 
the species of orgamsm, it is necessary to 
do further studies, since there are some 
times confusing cross reactions in the ag 
glutination tests, ic, some of the para 
colons (Paracohbaclr/ifrt) shire antigens

accomplished by doing biochemical studies 
and agglutinations with species specific an 
tlscra Bacteriophage suspensions specific 
for Sflimonelln are available and may also 
be useful in identification Smaller lab- 
oratories may have to send cultures to 
laboratories specialized in these techniques

IdenUficotwn of Enieropa^ho^en^c Types 
of Escherichia coli 

Smce the pioneer work of Kaufinann 
starting in 1943 on the antigenic analysis 
of Eschenchta coli it has been found that 
certain serologic varieties are associated 
with diarrhea m infants and children Se 
vere cases both sporadic and epidemic in 
which the etiology was formerly unknown 
ha\e been proved to be caused by these 
serotypes Consequently it is essential to 
isolate and identify these organisms from 
climcal cases and from earners 

Biochemical differences between the en 
teropathogenic strains and the normal types 
of E coh are insufficient to differentiate 
them adequately from each other Type 
differentiation thus depends entirely on 
their serologic behavior 

E coll possesses three types of antigens 
— O K and H The O or somatic antigens 
are not inactivated by heat The K anti 
gens also somatic antigens occur as 
sheaths or envelopes which block the 0 
agglutination They are destroyed by heat 
at 100® C The K anugens consist of three 
varieties known as L A and B H antigens 
are the flagellar antigens found only in the 
motile srrams 

In typing the enteropathogenic strams 
of E coll It is necessary to determme both 
the O antigen and the B \ ariety of K 
antigen The serologic types that most com 
monly are associated with diarrheal dis 
eases are listed in Table 16-8

be collected before specific therapy is m 
stituted Specimens may be taken from 
freshly soiled diapers or collected by means 
of rectal swabs If stools must be held for 
several hours before inoculation of media 
they should be emulsified in buffered glyc 
erol saline 

Specimens should be streaked on EMB 
or MacConkeys agar and usmg a light 
inoculum on a blood agar plate The blood 
agar is used because certain strains are 
inhibited on EMB or MacConkey’s and also 
because it is easier to avoid contaminants 
when picking colonies from this medium 
Sorbitol agar may also be useful since 
enteropathogenic strams of E coh tend to 
be sorbitol negative It is necessary how 
ever to use the other media since sorbitol 
positive strains of enteropathogemc E coh 
are occasionally encountered Sorbitol neg 
ative strams should be checked with the 
acnflavine dye test The test is done by 
suspending a colony in a drop of normal 
saline soluuon and adding one drop of 
neutral acnflavine (1 500 aqueous) If no 
agglutination occurs withm one minute the 
colony IS then typed with antiserum Those 
that agglutinate may be discarded as non 
pathogens In addiuon to these media the 
procedure for the isolation of Salmonella 
and Shigella and parasitologic examination 
must be followed and a specimen collected 
for possible virus isolation (See Table 
16-9 ) 

After overnight incubation at 37® C 
typical strains of E coh are picked to 
nutnent agar slants for serologic study 
There are no distinct differences m colonial 
morphology between the pathogenic and 
nonpathogenic serotypes hence colomes 
must be picked at random However en 
teropathogenic strams may give off a defi 
nite spermatic odor on first isolation and 
when they are present they tend to pre 
dommate The nutrient agar slants are 
incubated overnight and then tested with 
OB and O antisera 

Serologic Typing In t^qimg the entero 
pathogemc E coh the O antigen and the 
B vanety of K antigen must be determined 
Smce the B antigen masks the 0 agglutm 
abibty of Uvmg cultures the culture must 
be boUed before the O antigens can be 
determmed The OB antiserums* contain 
the agglutinins for both the O and B an 
tigens the O antiserums* are used only 
after the B antigen has been destroyed by 
heating

A drop of polyvalent OB antiserum is 
placed on a slide, and a small loopful of 
the culture from the agar slant is emulsi- 
fied in the serum to gne a homogenous 
suspension The slide is then rotated for 
one to two minutes and agglutination ob 
served macroscopically The clumping must 
be rapid and strong, otherwise it should be 
ignored If positive, individual (specific) 
OB antiserums are used Alternatively it is 
also possible to test individual colomes di 
rectly from the plates m OB antisera If 
strong agglutination occurs either in the 
polyvalent antiserums or in any of the 
individual serotypes, a preliminary report 
that an enteropathogemc E colt is present 
can be given and further serologic and 
biochemical tests done to confirm this and 
to determme the specific serotype 

If positive agglutmation occurs in the 
OB antiserum, the 0 antigen must be de- 
termined This can be done by first beating 
a saline suspension of the culture for 30 
minutes at 100" C and adding 0 5 per 
cent formalin Serial dilutions of the spe- 
cific antiserums are then made xn small 
test tubes so that a senes of dilutions 
ranging from 1 20 to 1 2560 in 0 5 ml of 
saline are prepared These dilutions depend 
on the original titer of the antiserum To 
each of these dilutions 0 5 ml of the 
cooled formalinized broth cultures is added 
The tubes are then incubated at 50" C 
for 16 to 18 hours Cultures showing ag 
glutmation in dilutions of at least I 160 
or more are considered to have the same 
O antigen as the corresponding antiserum 
If agglutination is not distinct except in 


low dilutions, this should be considered as 
negative for that particular 0 antigen If 
strong agglutination occurs in more than 
one antiserum, this probably indicates a 
mixed culture, and the original agar slant 
should be streaked for purity and individual 
colonies retested 

It is also possible to test the O antigens 
by the slide test, but this should always 
be confirmed by the test tube procedure 
The unboiled culture is tested on a slide 
with OB antiserums and a boiled culture 
with O antiserums Agglutination in both 
antiserums is strong evidence for the iden 
tification of that serotjpe 

The final step zn the identification is to 
check the strain biochemically to show 
that It belongs to the E coli group (see 
Table 16-9) 

The classification of the genus Paracolo 
bactrtim (paracolon) is rather complex 
The species may be designated accordmg 
to their position in relauon to the other 
Enterobactenaceae Thus the species are 
P colifonne (related to C coli), P aero 
fferiotdes (related to A aerogenes and in 
eluding the Hafnia group), P intermedium 
(intermediate), and P anzonae (Arizona 
group) On the basis of serologic and bio 
chemical characteristics the paracolons 
may be grouped into three categones now 
designated as the Arizona, Ballerup Beth 
esda. and Providence groups Many of the 
paracolons are slow lactose fermenters and 
mdol positive, and these reactions may be 
used as a differential test A number of 
strains have antigens in common uith cer- 
tain other enteric bacilli Some are associ

of plague (bubonic or pneumonic) Fortu 
nately few cases of plague have occurred 
in man m recent years The organism ex- 
ists in the rodent population over a wide 
area of the western United States and 
causes widespread epidemics, especially in 
ground squirrels (sylvatic plague) 

Bactenologic diagnosis of plague is not 
dltficuU Direct smear and gram stain from 
aspirates of buboes or sputum (pneumonic 
plague) may reveal gram negative bacilli 
with bipolar granules in large numbers, 
which can be grown on tryptlcase soy agar 
plates (Fig 16-32) The organism must 
be handed with extreme care In the lab-

Most cells ate slender slightlj curved rods 
which may have beads or bands of deep 
staining material (mctachromatic gran 
ules) Thcte cells tend to lie side b> side

dipfitficriae occurs as four t) pcs— gravis 
mills Intermcdius and minimus— and the 
cellular morphologj differs somewhat for 
each type 

As indicated in a previous section the 
identification of C dipht/ienac depends to 
a considerable extent on the colony inor

The cell of C diphthenae gravis is Jess 
CTanular and banded than the others There

like the diphtheroids Mitis miermedius 
and mimmus tend to be longer and more 
granular or banded

diphthenae does not invade the blood 
sufBciently to produce positive blood cul 
tures However, it can usually be isolated 
with ease from lesions in the throat or from 
the skin in cutaneous diphthena The or 
gamsrns may disappear from the throat of 
a patient vvithm one or two weeks after 
recovery, only to reappear at about the 
fifth or sixth week It is therefore impera 
live that all convalescent patients be ob- 
served for six to eight weeks to be certain 
that they are not acting as carriers of the 
disease Some individuals remam carriers 
for extended periods and present serious 
problems because the earner state is difii 
cult to clear 

/The diphtheroids (C pseudodiphthenti 
cum and others) are normal inhabitants of 
the throat and skm and have little if any 
pathologic significance Their importance is 
in their morphologic resemblance to C 
diphthenae, especially gmvis (Fig 16-39) 
vMost diphtheroids do riot_produce dark 
gray or black colonies on tellunte but some 
do They are usually smooth and glistening 
not wnnkled like gravis Occasionally one 
must do toxicity studies to dilTercntiate the 
organisms The toncity test is always the 
final test for virulence of a suspected C 
diphthenae (see p 729) Some differences 
m ^blochemlcal activity exist between the 
gravis mius mtermedius and minimus 
strains and the diphtheroids Mitis strains

gravis ferments starch '<vhile the diphther 
Olds arc quite inactive Gravis also tends to 
grow as a pellicle on the surface of fluid 
media

monocytogenes is a gram positive, motile 
bacillus that may resemble diphtheroids or, 
when the rods are short it may resemble 
Streptococcus pyogenes (Fig 16-40) The 
medium of choice is probably rabbit blood

the most toxic substances knmvn to man 
(the exotoxms) Cl tetam causes tetanus. 
Cl botnhnum causes botulism, and some 
species cause gas gangrene (Cl perfnngens 
Iwelchu] Cl septicum. Cl novyt [oedema 
tiens], Cl histolijticum) 

None of these organisms Is an actne jn 
vader of tissue Cl tetam and the gas 
gangrene organisms are usually introduced 
into wounds and multiply in necrotic tissue 
where anaerobic conditions exist Usually 
culture from such wounds reveals that 
other anaerobic bacteria or aerobic bac 
tena are also present and it is necessary 
to separately identify the various organ 
isms Thus, m diagnostic work it is best 
to streak the material on plates and to 
incubate anaerobically The material sub 


nutted for culture is usually tissue that 
can be macerated for culture and gram 
stain 

Cl botuliniim probably never multiphes 
in zivo It multiplies in food (home canned 
\egetables), producing its potent entero 
toxin, which is then ingested by man or 
ammals One may be able to demonstrate 
or to culture orgamsms from the suspected 
food or the toxin by injection into mice 
with suitable controls of ammals protected 
with anlitoxm Toxins A, B, and E are the 
most commonly found in human disease

ANAEROBIC STREPTOCOCCI 

The anaerobic streptococci are poorly

chronic abscesses of \anous tyTics in 
pilonidal cysts and in umbihcal lesions 
They are ^so present in some cases of 
puerperal sepsis Sometimes microaero- 
phihc streptococn are isolated from the

These orgamsms grow rather slowly, and 
cultures should be incubated anaerobically

nema are similar, bemg delicate, spiral 
orgamsms m which the 6 to 12 coils are 
rather loose, they tend to bend m the cen 
ter (See Fig 36^5 ) 

Borreiw appear in the blood at the onset 
of relapses and may be demonstrated in 
Giemsa stained blood smears, where they 
appear as wavy, hair like orgamsms Blood 
can be inoculated mto mice or rats Large 
numbers appear in the blood after a few 
days Mice often carry these organisms 
naturally, and great care must be exercised 
to make sure the mouse colony is free of 
the Borreha Culture of these orgamsms is 
difficult 

T pallidum IS best demonstrated by 
darkfield imcroscopy (see p 3) In the 
absence of darkfield equipment one may 
stain smears from the aspirate of the 
chancre by Fontana stain The india ink 
method to be described may also be used 
No cultural methods are a\ailable (Figs 
1&-54, 16-55) 

Leptospira tcterohaemorrhagtae, the 
causative agent of Weil s disease, is widely 
distnbuted in the infected individual and 
appears in the blood early m the disease 
After 10 to 14 days the orgamsms are pres 
ent in considerable numbers in the unne 
These organisms are rather easily cultured 
in fairly simple medium containing rabbit

serum, peptone, and Ringer’s solution, and 
Cox and Larson (1957) have shown that 
they can be cultured on simple sohd media 
Blood or unne may be inoculated intra 
peritoneally into a guinea pig, or into mice 
The organisms can be demonstrated in the 
blood after a few days or in the tissues 
at necropsy The Leptospira have tight 
coils and one or both ends are hooked In 
darkfield preparations they are seen to to 
rate very rapidly 

Patients with Weils disease show stnk 
mg antibody responses and agglutination 
or complement fbcation tests on acute and 
convalescent sera are useful in diagnosis 
Antigens are available for testing antibody 
rises against the various other species of 
Leptospira 

In addition to Weil s disease members of 
the Leptospira are responsible for certain 
other ^seases m various parts of the world 
e g , swamp fever m Europe (L gnppo- 
typhosa) and swmeherds thsease (L po 
mona) There are a large number of 
serotypes of these orgamsms based on differ- 
ences in aggluunation— lysis and cross 
absorption tests The differentiation of 
these strains is of considerable epidemic 
lope importance 

India Ink Method for Spirochetes A 
relatively simple means of oemonstrating 
spinxrheies in blood or unne involves the 
use of India ink It requires a good padc 
of ink * A small drop of the India Ink is 
mixed with 1 or 2 drops of the specimen 
This mixture is then spread over the slide 
and allowed to dry On examination with 
the oil immersion lens the spirochetes ap 
pear white on a brown or black back- 
pound Some India inks contain wavy veg- 
etable fibnis and bacteria that may be 
misleading, and exudates sometimes ag 
gluUnate the ink particles, making this type 
of preparation unsausfactory

THE ACID EAST BACTERIA 
(Ml COBdCTERimi) 

A number of acid fast bacteria are patho 
gemc for man M tuberculosis (human) 
and M hmis (bovine) have long been rec 
ognized for their role on human tubeicu 
losis and have been studied extensively In 
recent years two ne?i groups of aadlast 
organisms, apparently capable of causing 
tuberculosis have been recogmzed — the so 
called “yeUoiv bacilh and M fortmtum 
These are large acid fast bacteria that are 
not pathogenic for rabbits and guinea pigs 
but usually are pathogenic for mice Their 
pathogenicity is not yet completely under 
stood Af amum has been reported in cases 
of chronic involvement of localized lymph 
nodes but the extent of its pathogenicity 
m humans is not clear The relation of 
Hansens bacillus (Af leprae) to leprosy 
seems fairly well established although 
final undisputed proof of its primary role 
in the disease has not yet been accom 
plished 

In Table 1&-17 ate shown some of the 
important characteristics of the most Un 
portant mycobactena Numerous similar 
organisms exist in nature and infect a 
number of warm and cold blooded animal 
species 

The diagnosis of tuberculosis depends on 
clinical xray and bactenologic findings 
Every effort must be made to demonstrate 
the organism In sputum unne or other 
matenal by acid fast stain cultures and 
animal inoculations In pulmonary tubercu

secretions or gastric contents are e\

highly suggesuve and when this is fol

definitive Acid fast stains can be done on 
tissue smears and sections and maj be very

The human and bovine tubercle bacilli 
are slender straight or slightly curved 
rods which occur singly or in clumps They 
frequently have metachromatic ^nnules 
which may give them a beaded appearance 
or they may be bipolar, giving the organ 
ism a dumbbell appearance The nonpntho- 
genic acid fast bacilli tend to be less gran

humans In general these organisms pro> 
duce smooth pigmented colonies, have a

based on the recommendations of Bunyon 
is summarized In Table 16-18 
A simple procedure that is helpful m 
differentiating nonpathogenic acid fast or- 
ganisms from virulent strains of M tuber 
culosh IS as follows three tubes of Lowen- 
steln Jensen medium are inoculated uni 
formly uith the unknown organism (see 


Table 35—19) Tube 3 contains 10 per 
ml of INH (isomcotmic hydrazide) Tubes 
1 and 3 are incubated for three weeks at 
37® C and tube S is kept at room tern 
perature 

Virulence Tests for M Tuberailosis 

Neutral Red Test (Dubos and Middle- 
brook, 19 18; Morse, Dail, and Olitsky, 1953) 
A loopful of culture from the surface of 
solid medium or approximately I ml from 
the growth in hguid medium is transferred 
to a corked 15 ml comcal centrifuge tube 
containing 5 ml of 50 per cent methanol 
The tube is alloued to stand 30 to 60 mm 
utes at 37® C and is then centrifuged 
thoroughly The sediment is resuspended in 
another 5 ml portion of methanol and re 
incubated for another hour The sediment 
is then suspended in 5 ml of buffer (NaCl 
5 gm , sodium barbital, 1 gm , distilled 
water. 100 ml , 0 05 per cent neutral red, 
0 2 nil ) The tube is allowed to stand at 
room temperature for one hour, shaken at 
15 minute intervals, and examined with a 
bright light and a hand lens Colonies of 
virulent strains stain light pink to deep 
red Avirulent organisms do not change 
the color of the dye, the buffer remaining 
clear amber in color Adequate controls 
should accompany each test, consisting of 
known virulent and avirulent strains The 
test must be done m a hood or safety cabi 
net because of the danger of spread of 
virulent tubercle bacilli 

Niacin Test (Konno and Sbarra, 1959)

THE TAR^VSITIC PROTOZO \ 

As indicated In a preMous section a 
number of protozoa are capable of li\'ing 
in the intestinal tract of man None of 
these is a normal inhabitant although most 
of them are considered nonpathogenic 
However the presence of large numbers of 
any one of these organisms in the stool of 
a patient may be Mewed with some sus 
picion that the organism may be contnbut 
ing to whate\er clinical condition may 
exist Most of the entenc protozoa have a 
worldwide distribution and the percentage 
of an) population harbonng these organ 
isms IS determined by their living condi 
tions diet and samtary habits 

There are in addition several protozoa 
that live in the blood and tissues of man. 
All are pathogemc producing such dis 
eases as malaria trypanosomiasis and 
leishmaniasis Their distnbution is usually 
bmited to areas where the proper arthropod 
vectors are present In areas where they 
exist they present serious problems in diag 
nosis treatment and prevention In this 
section the fundament^ charactemtics of 
the parasiuc protozoa will be related to 
diagnosis 


The Intestinal Amebae (Rhizopoda) 

There are five well recognized species of 
amebae belonging to four genera that are 
found m the human digestive tract En 
tamoeba histolytica Entamoeba colt En 
dohmax nana lodamoeba hutschln (vvil 
bamsi) and Dientamoeba fragilis These 
amebae with one exception exist in three 
forms in the digestive tract of man The 
trophozoite or vegetative stage multiplies 


Labor atorv Methods 

by binary fission and mov es about by 
means of pscudopods which are quite char 
acteristic in some of the species Tin. 
trophozoites ingest particles and contaui 
these particles in vacuoles in their cyto- 
plasm In the prccyst stage the trophozoite 
rounds up the inclusions are extruded and 
the cell wall thickens The nucleus may 
divide dunng this period Tlie cyst is an 
extension of the preejst The cell wall be 
comes fairly thick and resistant and the 
nucleus may divide once or several times 
so that the c>st depending on the species 
may contain one to eight nuclei These nu 
del arc much smaller than those in the 
trophozoite 

TTie differentiation of the species of pro- 
tozoa depends on the size type of pseudo 
pod and nuclear and cytoplasmic struc 
lure of the trophozoite and on the size and 
nuclear and cjtoplasmic structure of the 
cjsts and precysts One must become thor 
oughlj familiar with these features to do 
reliable parasitologic examinations (Fig 
1&-59) 

Entamocb'i histoljtica Entamoeba his 
tolytica IS the most pathogenic of the en 
tenc amebae It produces acute amebic 
dysemer) in tropical areas and occasion 
all) in temperate zones and there is little 
question of its direct euologic significance 
in this condition A varying percentage of 
various population groups in the temperate 
zones is infected with E histolytica Certain 
of these infecuons are asymptomauc and 
may remain so for extended periods Others 
have an vnegular course with short bouts 
of diarrhea intermingled wnth periods of 
constipation There may be selective dys 
pepsia to certain foods such as milk and 
greas) foods with considerable gas and 
abdominal discomfort It is not easy to 
evaluate the role of E histolytica in pa 
tients with these symptoms It is highly 
desirable that m patients with chronic 
gastrointestinal disease m whom E his 
tolytica is found a complete workup be 
done to rule out such conditions as car 
cinoma and ulcerative colitis before at 
tempting to determine the role of the 
amebae 

The trophozoite of E histolytica has cer 
tarn diagnostic characteristics The nucleus 
IS round with a debcate nng of chromatm 
around the penpher) which tends to be 
beaded The chromatm ring may on oc 
casion be heavier m some areas than m 
others The nucleus has a smaD debcate 
centrall) located kar)osome The nucleus is 
usually about one third the diameter of the

trophozoite The cytoplasm is delicate and 
may appear foamy m stained preparations 
with a thm cell wall This organism char 
acteristically ingests red blood cells and the 
finding of red blood cells in the trophozoite 
IS diagnostic In fresh warm specimens 
the trophozoites send out clear hyaline 
pseudopods which tend to continue coming 
out in the same direction gix'ing what has 
been termed umdirectional motion The size 
of E Justofytfcfl trophozoites vanes from 8 
to 9 microns to as much as 20 to 25 im 
crons 

The precyst is usually round and the cell 
wall is thicker than in the trophozoite 
Tliere may be one or tivo typical nuclei 


Charactenstically there appear nther large 
structures called chromatoidal bars ivhich 
are cigar shaped and stain black mth 
hematoxylin stain but remain unstained 
with iodine When found these are diag 
nostic but they do not always occur 

The cyst of E histolytica has a heaiy 
cyst wall with a delicate nongranular c> 
toplasm The chromatoid bars tend to dis 
appear There are characteristically four 
nuclei although occasionally there may be 
eight The nuclei are much smaller than 
those in the trophozoite but ha\e the same 
structure Tlie size of the cysts ^arles from 
5 to 15 microns

trophozoites of £ hisloli/lica has led to an 
arbitrary classification into tt o races The 
large race comprises those uith average 
cyst sizes of 10 microns and over and the 
small race those with average cyst sizes 
under 10 microns Evidence indicates that 
the two races are different in certain funda 
mental respects The large race is associ 
ated with the most severe pathologic le 
sions i c acute amebic dysentery liver 
lung and brain abscess and cutaneous 
amebiasis The small race tends to be found 
in persons with chronic gastrointestinal 
disease in which their role is difficult to 
evaluate they have not been found in liver 
abscess or in other extraintestinal compli 
cations They do not ingest red blood cells 
and are much more difficult to culture 
Some workers have descnbed additional 
small amebae which resemble the small 
race very closely and are termed En 
taiiioeha hartmanni they are said to be 
nonpathogenic Further study Is needed to 
clarify the relationship between the large 
and small race E histolytica and E hart 
manm (Figs 16-60 16-61) 

The laboratory diagnosis of acute amebic 
djsentery is usuall) not difficult Examlna 
tion of warm freshly passed stool reveals 
characteristic trophozoites In the chronic 
or asjmptomatic case of amebiasis in 
which the stool may be formed it is usual 
to find only the cysts in the stools The 
cjsts may be present in very small numbers 
and considerable search fs necessary Tlifs 
IS particularly true in small race infections 


in which the cysts may be sparse and 
small It IS also important to emphasize 
that small race cysts are very difficult if 
not impossible to ^ffcrentiate from En 
tlolimax nana cysts in wet preparations 
(unstained or iodine stained) Thus hema 
toxyhn stained fecal smears are very Im 
portant 

The number of positive findings depends 
on the care diligence and experience of 
the person doing the examinations An ex 
perienced worker may be able to make a 
systemauc search of a slide in ten min 
utes but the less experienced will need 
more time The number of daily stool ex 
arrunations for a given patient will be de 
termined by the degree of suspicion that 
exists One should never do less than three 
complete stool examinations and six are 
recommended Certain structures in the 
stool ma> be confusing and ft Is important 
to be thoroughly familiar with stool cy 
tology Macrophages are likely to be trou 
blesomc since they are motile and Ingest 
red blood cells Their nuclear structure 
however is quite different and can be used 
for differentiation especially when stained 
with hematoxylin The presence of certain 
structures in the stool such as Charcot 
Le>den crystals has been considered sug 
gestive of E hisfo/j/ficc infection However 
these structures occur also in the absence 
of these amebae (Fig 16-62)

the amebae are present in the tissues at the 
edge of the abscess and are only Infre 
quently found in the pus in the center of 
the lesion Tlius smears or sections made 
from tissue at the edge of the lesion should 
be examined Lung abscess results some 
times from extension of a liver abscess 
through the diaphragm In such cases the 
amebae can be demonstrated in aspirated 
material Amebic peritonitis and involve 
ment of other organs have been described 

Cutaneous amebiasis occurs most fre 
quently in the perianal region and on the

Other Intestinal Vmebae Entamoeba 
coll is a nonpathogemc ameba that occurs 
usually in a higher per cent of indmduals 
than does E histoli/iica It is important 
from two standpoints First it is necessary 
that E coll be differentiated from £ fits 
tolytica for it bears a considerable resem 
blance to the large race Second since this 
and other intestmal amebae are transmitted 
in the same manner as E fiistoUjtica its 
presence in the stool increases the suspicion 
that E histolytica might also be present 

The trophozoite of Entamoeba coli is 
generally larger than that of E htstohjUca 
varymg from 15 to 35 microns m diameter 
Its nucleus has a denser nng of chromatin 
around the edge and its karyosome is 
larger and eccentnc The karyosome may 
appear to be centrallj located depending 
on how It is oriented The cytoplasm of E 
coU IS coarse and it does not ingest red 
blood cells It may ingest bactena The cell 
wall tends to be thicker and its pseudopods 
are not so clear as those of E histolytica 
The pscudopods (end to come out in sev 
eral directions and its motility is not um 
directional 

The precysi may have one or more nu 
clei and chroznatoid bars but the bars arc 
Me/y to be shorter and thicker and to hate 
splintered ends The cytoplasm is rather 
coarse 

The ripe cyst of E coli is usually larger 
(15 to 25 microns) than that of £ hts 
tolytica and usually has eight nuclei with 
eccentnc karyosomes The cytoplasm again 
is coarse and the cell wall is heavier than 
that of E histolytica With expenence the 
differentiation of £ coh from E histolytica 
IS not too difficult especially with the cysts 
and precysts 

Endolimax nana is a nonpathogen that 
occurs in a varying percentage of the popu 
iation It IS a small ameba and may be 
confused easily with the small race of E 
histotytica As mentioned previously it is 
not easy to distinguish between these or 
ganisms m wet preparations 

Trophozoites are motile by means of 
clear hyaline pseudopods and tend to be 
unidirectional In unstained preparations 
they have a greenish coloration Their cy

a large karyosome which may fill a con 
siderable part of the nucleus There is a

Gf»ii<5 Tryfiauosoma 

Trypanosomes have been found In the 
blood plasma of a great variety of verte- 
brates Many of them appear to produce 
no symptoms, but a few are of great patlio 
gcnic importance Many species have lx;cn 
described Tlie forms found in the blood 
arc easily recognized as trypanosomes, but 
accurate determination of species Is difii- 
cult and may be impossible on the basis of 
their shape alone They are elongated, 
spindle shaped bodies, the average length 
of difTercnt species varying from 10 to 70 
microns Along one side runs a delicate 
undulating membrane, the free edge of 
which appears to be somewhat longer than 
the attached edge, thus throwing it into 
folds Somewhere In the body, usually near 
the middle, is a comparatively palo-otainfng 
nucleus and nt.ar the posterior end is a 
sroalJer, more deeply siiinlrtg chromatin 
mass, the micronucicus or blcpharopKibi 
A number of coarse, deeply staining gran 
ulcs— chromatophorcs— may be scattered 
through tlic cytoplasm A flagellum arises 
In the blepharoplast, p.asscs along the free 
edge of tlic undulating membrane, and 
continues posteriorly .as a frtc flagellum 
These dct.ails of structure are shown in

hosts v.arious insects playing the part of 
Intcrmcdi.aio host At least three species of 
Trypanosoma arc pathogenic for man 
These arc pathogenic to a variable degree 
for some of the lower mammals, which In 
the wild state serve as reservoirs from 
which man may become infected through 
the agency of the insect host 

The best known trypanosome of human

they can be found also in the cerebrospinal 
fluid The length of the parasite varies from 
15 to 33 microns There are short, stumpy 
forms, long, slender forms, and intermedi- 
ate forms The parasite is transmuted by 
a biting fly, Glosstna palpatis A second 
species that causes sleeping sickness in 
Africa IS Tn/panosoma rhodestense The 
chief difference between it and Trypano- 
soma gambiense is the situation of the 
nucleus close to, or even posterior to. the 
blepharoplast It is transmitted by the fly, 
Glossina morsttans The antelope and other 
large game animals are probably the reser- 
voir for these African tr^anosomes 

Trypanosoma cruzi is the cause of Brazil 
lan trjpanosomiasis or Chagas’ disease 
In the febrile stage of the disease the or 
ganism is found in the peripheral blood 
without much difficulty Its average length 
IS about 20 microns The life cycle is very 
complicated In the vertebrate host mul- 
tiplication takes place m the muscles and 
certain internal organs in which the para 
sites assume forms resembling Letsiimnnia 
donovant The early phase of the flagellated 
stage IS passed within erjthrocytes. the 
later phase in the blood plasma The ar- 
madillo is probably the natural reservoir 
The insect host by which the trypanosome 
15 transmitted to man is a large bug be- 
longing to the genus Panstrongylns, which 
IS abundant in the dwellings of the poorer 
classes m Brazil There arc several species 
of which PanstTongylus megistus is most 
important and best known De Coursey re- 
ported a case of fatal Chagas’ disease 
observed in Panama Besides PanstrongyUis 
megistus other species of the superfamily 
ReduvUdae have been found to be vectors 
Reduvjid bugs are found also in the United 
Stales Opossums, armadillos bats, dogs, 
and squirrels have all been found to be 
natural hosts Packchanian demonstrated 
that a Texan strain of Trypanosoma cmzt 
found m a bloodsucking msect, Tnatoma 


heidemanni, was capable of infecting man 
with a disease clinically identical with 
Chagas* disease 

Trypanosoma lemst, a very common and 
afiparently harmless parasite of gray rats, 
especially sewer rats, is interesting because 
It closely resembles the pathogemc forms 
and IS easily obtained for study Its pos 
tenor end is more pomted than that of 
Trypanosoma gambiense 

Trypanosoma evanst, Trypanosoma 
brucet, and Trypanosoma eqntperdum pro-

ine, which are common and important dis 
eases of horses, mules, and cattle in the 
Philippines, East India, and Africa 

The S/iorozoa 

A number of protozoa of the group be- 
longmg to the Sporozoa (subclass Telo 
sporida) are parasitic, and there are three 
genera that contain species parasitic m 
man These are Isospora hominis, Eimeria 
gublen and stiedne, and Plasmodium vivax, 
malanae, falciparum, and ovale Hie latter 
species are the causative agents of malaria 
m man Each of the sporozoa has a life 
cycle involving propagation by means of 
sporulation In some the life cycle is quite 
complex, involving sexual and asexual re 
producave cycles (Plasmodium) 

Isospora Hominis 

Isospora hominis has been found in hu 
man feces Apparently it causes no par 
ticular disturbance Diagnosis depends on 
the recogmtion of oocysts m the feces 
These are colorless, ovoid bodies, measuring 
about 14 by 28 microns They have a 
clearcut, definite wall, which usually con- 
sists of two or more layers When they first 
pass out of the body, the protoplasm is 
unsegmented and appears as a rounded, 
granular mass that does not fill the cyst, 
as m Fig 16-439 They might easily be 
mistaken for the eggs of some unknown

infected with Eimena gublen This species 
has not been studied thoroughly therefore

Eimena stiedae which is commonl) found 
in rabbits and has been studied extensuely 

Eimena stiedae when fully developed 
is ovoid in shape it is about 30 to 50 mi 
crons long and has a shell like integument 
The parasite develops within the epithelial 
cells of the bile passages Its presence in 
rabbits causes the formation of whitish 
nodules which usually have caseous con 
tents On reaching the adult size the para 
site divides into a number of spores or 
merozQites which enter other epithelial 
cells and repeat the cycle A sexu^ cycle

with macrogamete a zygote is formed This 
acquires a defimte membranous wall and 
thus becomes an oocyst which passes out 
with feces Its contents then divide into a 


number of sporozoites The cyst remains 
quiescent until it reaches the stomach of 
a new host usually through contammated 
food Here the wall of the cyst is digested 
and the sporozoites arc set free to trav el to 
the liver and enter epithelial cells where 
they imtiate a new cycle 

A number of related species of Eimena 
have in very rare instances been found in 
man In most of these cases the oocyst was 
large and spherical 

Genus Plasmodium 

In the class Sporozoa and in the suborder 
of blood parasites usually called Ilaemo- 
sporidia is found the genus Plasmodium 
which includes all the parasites causing 
malaria in man and other animals Al 
though malaria is now rare in the United 
States It is still a very important disease 
in much of the world and is responsible 
directly or Indirectly for much debilitation 
and death 

Four species of the protozoan Plasmo 
dutm the genenc name of the cUologic 
agent are known viz iivax falciparum 
malanae and ovate Transmission from 
man to man is through the bite of certain 
species of infected female Anopheles mos

the parenchymal cells of the hver at which 
time there is a progressive development 
through several stages that eventually re 
suits in the development of merozoites 
These merozoites either initiate the erythro* 
cytic cycle by rupturing from the cell and 
penetrating red cells or penetrate other 
liver parenchymal cells to continue the 
exoeryihrocytic phase 

Once the asexual phase of the cycle is 
begun in the ted cells the parasite de 
velops beginning with nng forms and pro- 
gressing through the trophozoite to the 
early and mature schizonts This process 
known as schizogony is a 48 to-72 hour 
process depending upon the species and 
begms with a primary splitting of the 
ebromatm contmuing until merozoites are 
formed These merozoites rupture from the 
mature schizonts and penetrate new red 
cells This rupture of the red blood cells is 
associated with the chill and fever that 
charactenze clinical malaria After several 
asexual cycles some tend to become sex 
ually differentiated forms the male or mi 
crogametocyte and the female or macro- 
gametocyte while the majority continue 
the erythrocytic cycle The gametocytes do 
not contribute to the production of symp- 
toms and remam alive as long as the red 
cell lives about 120 days The paroxysm 
chill and fever is somewhat characteristic 
and occurs every 72 hours with P malartae 
infections but at 48 hour intervals with the 


other three species Different broods of 
organisms may give irregular paroxysms 
wbeh may be quotidian rather than strictly 
tertian or quartan 

Only the gametocytes aro mfective for 
the mosquito In the stomach of the female 
mosquito they mature as zmerogametes and 
macrogametes The mictogamctcs exflagcl 
late and fertilize the macrogamete to be 
come a zygote The zygote elongates and 
becomes actively motile and is called an 
ookinete This form penetrates the stomach 
wall and rounds up on the outside of the 
wall to become an oocyst As it matures to 
a sporocyst slender sporozoites develop 
and these break out and migrate to the 
sahvary glands where they are retained 
until the next blood meal at which tune 
they enter the blood of the human 

Differentiation of Species Walker (1952) 
has given a concept of the basic facts of 
malana that have an important bearing on 
the recognition of the species under the 
microscope as shown at the top of p 673 

Species diagnosis is important according 
to Walker to Insure the immediate treat 
ment of falciparum malana in which com 
pletely unpredictable symptoms may de 
velop Furthermore m vivax malana it is 
useful to be able to estimate from the 
observation of the developmental stage of 
the majonty of the parasites when the next 
paroxysm may be expected

Toxoplasma Gomlii 

Toxoplasma goadh is the causative 
agent of toxoplasmosis in man and animafs 
and was ongmally described from a North 
African rodent, the gondi In human adults 
the infection is usually asymptomatic and 


unrecognized, although occasional sjmpto 
matic and fatal cases occur In chddren 
the disease may produce a syndrome in 
vohing the central nervous system and the 
viscera Congemtally acquired infection oc 
curs and is manifest m the infant or young 
child as an encephahtis accompanied by 
such features as chorioretinitis, hjdroceph 
alus or microcephaly, micro ophthalmos 
intracerebral calcification, and mental re 
tardation Convoilsions may occur In such 
cases parenchymal and reticuloendothelial 
cells are generally affected, and lesions oc 
cut in the bram spleen kidneys, adrenals, 
and bmph nodes 

Serologic studies indicate that infecuon 
ttith T gondii is fairly widespread in the 
population, although active cases in adults 
are, as mentioned previously, rare Such 
active cases usually have prolonged remit 
tant fever with such accompanying features 
as pneumonitis, encephahtis and myo 
carditis There may be a rash, generahzed 
lymphadenitis and myositis accompanied 
bj generalized aching and pain In some 
areas 50 per cent or more of the populaaon 
at age 20 years show a positive serologic 
test 

T gondii, when it occurs in the free 
stage, IS curved or crescent shaped meas 
unng 4 to 6 microns m length and 2 to 3 
microns in width with one extremity more 
rounded than the other When stained by 
Wnghts or Giemsas method, the cyto 
plasm is blue and the nucleus is a red or 
purple, irregular structure occupying one 
fifth to one fourth of the cell The nucleus 
lies near the rounded end of the orgamsm 
The cells tend to occur singl> or in pairs 
(Fig 16-74) 

When T gondit is found m the paren- 
chymal or reticuloendothelial cells, the or- 
ganisms lose their crescent shape and may 
be confused with the lelshmanias They 
occur singly or in clusters in these tissue 
cells In certain instances, especially in 
the brain of mice, T gondii occurs as clus 
ters of organisms called pseudocysts 

The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis depends 
on demonstration of the organisms in 
blood, bone marrow cerebrospinal fluid, or 
exudates from serous cavities by staining 
or by Intracerebral or intrapentoneal inocu 
lauon of these matenals into mice After 
three to six weeks the inoculated mice are 
sacrificed, and Ijmph nodes spleen iiver

Serologic tests are of talue as presump- 
tive evidence of toxoplasmosis Complement 
fixation the Sabin Feldman dye test or 
fluorescent antibody techniques may be 
used Since few laboratones are equipped 
to do these tests JO ml of blood should 
be collected aseptically and sent to an ap- 
propriate laboratory (usually the state 
health department laboratory) It is not 
usually possible to demonstrate the organ 
ism m congenital cases thus it is usually 
necessary to do serial serologic tests on the 
blood of both the mother and the infant 
Slun tests (toxoplasmm) are of some value 
and are discussed on p 814 

THE HELMINTHS 

Two phyla of worms (helminths) are of 
medical importance ^cmathelrnlnches 
(roundworms) and Platyhelminthes (flat 
worms MZ flukes and tapeworms) 

Diagnosis of these helminthic infections 
in the chnlcal laboratory is based upon the 
demonstration of the ova larvae or otlier 
stages of the parasite in body fluids stools 
and tissues or in the environment The life 
cycles of the helminths may be quite com 
plex, and one should know something of 
these life cycles to be belter able to decide 
what examinations are needed The most 
important human helminths are presented 
in Table 16-20 

The \emalodes 

Distinguishing features of the nematodes 
arc as follows cylindrical shape nonseg 
mented body tapered ends and a cuticular 
covering The Intricate digestive system is 
complete with both mouth and anus The 
nematodes are diccious and generally the 


males are much smaller and more slender 
than the female worms 

Several females of the newatodes ore 
viviparous but generally ova are produced 
in quantities each day a fact that makes 
diagnosis easier Some of the common 
nematode ova are seen in Fig 16-75 The 
reproductive organs are bilaterally sym 
metneal tubular and coiled within the 
body An excretory system and a nenous 
system ejost but vascular and respiratory 
systems do not 

Enicrobius \crmiculans The seatworm 
pr pinuorm causing human enterobiasis or 
oxyiinasis is Entcrobius vcrmlcitlans 
(Oxyuns xeTimciilans') This common hcl 
mimh is widely distnbuted in famihes and 
in institutions Broadly speaking sanitation 
Js not a pnmary factor In its dissemination 
rather it is neglected individual hygiene 
that permiis rapid spread of the infection 
This infection occurs at all economic levels 

TTie female vvorm is distinctive In pos 
sessing a long narrow sharply pointed 
tail the characteristic from which it gets 
the name pmworm Females measure 8 to 
13 mm in length and 0 5 mm in diameter 
the male is 2 to 5 mm In length and 0 5 
mm in diameter with a vcnirally curved 
postenor end The adults possess cephalic 
alae or wings at iheir anterior end (Fig 
16-76) 

The site of predilection of the adult 
worms is the neighborhood of the cecum 
The gravid femaJo migrates to the anus 
where she crawls about on the perianal 
folds and deposits large numbers of eggs 
These eggs are fullv embryon^ted are Im 
mediately infective and only need to be 
swallowed for reinfection or to establish 
an infection in a new host 

Since ova and adults arc seldom ‘:cen in 
feces specific diagnosis rests upon the re 
covery of the eggs or adult females from 
the perianal region Althougli there arc 
numerous methods available the best 
known is the Graham scotch tape tech

Rather the female migrates usuall) at 
night while the induidual is resting and

eggs can be picked up best by using a 
scotch tape method early in the morning 
before getting out of bed or at least before 
defecation Since the worms maj not mi 
grate each night scotch tape preparations 
should be made on three successive mom 
mgs 

1 Apply a strip of scotch tape to 3 
inches in length on the upper side begin 
mng at one end of a tongue blade A small 
portion of the end on the opposite portion 
of vhe tongue blade abould be folded ow 
Itself This provides a nonsticky surface for 
h andlin g the tape 

2 To obtain a sample pull the folded 
tab so that the sticky side of the tape is 
freed still leaving enough of it stuck to 
the tongue blade 

3 Carry the freed tape over the end of 
the blade so that the sneky side is out 

4 Hold the tongue depressor with the 
thumb and second finger and hold the tape 
to the tongue blade with the forefinger 

5 Press the sucky surface onto the right 
and left penanal folds but do not insert 
the blade mto the rectum 

6 Replace the tape onto the tongue 
blade (These blades can be sent by mail 
to the laboratory ) 

7 Transfer the tapes to microscope 
slides 


8 Pull tape back from the shde leavmg 
a small portion attached 

9 Add a drop of toluene and replace 
the tape on the slide (The toluene clears 
everything except the ova and adults )

IS about S mm thick or about the size of 
a lead pencil with most of the worm given 
to reproductive organs the males 10 to 30 
cm long are more slender and have a ven 
trally curved tail The cuticle Is pinkish

their size have tnlobate lips at their an 
tenor end an outstandmg charactenstic 
that aids in the identification of small im

this genus 

The fertilized ovnim (Figs 36-75 16-80)

in length by 3o to oO microns in breadth 
The thick shell has an outer albuminous 
covenng which is coarsely mammilatcd 
and IS stained with bile to a golden brown 
or yellow color Those fertihzed ova that 
have lost their albuminoid coat are denoted 
as decorticated and tbev must be diiferen

Trichnrts trichtura Tnclmns triclnura 
(TnchocepJfflhis tnclniirn) is commonly 
called the whipworm and causes trichun 
asis (tnchocephaliasis) The adults (Fig 
16-85) are 3 5 to 5 0 cm long with an 
attenuated vvhip-hke antenor end and a 
thicker postenor portion which is bluntly 
rounded in the female and coiled like a 
watch spring in the male The worms ire 
pinkish white in color The characteristic 
ova (Fig 36-86) are football shaped with 
mucus plugs at either pole They are golden 
brovm with a thick shell and measure 50 
to 54 microns long and about 23 microns 
wide 

Embryonated ova in the soil are infective

Tnchoslrotigyliis orientolts A number of 
species of Tnchostrongylus have been 
found in man, although they are primarily 
parasites of herbivorous animals The lar 
vae from the soil are ingested with con 
tammated food The adults are small and 
live in the jejunum and upper ileum of 
man Diagnosis is based upon finding the 
ova (Fig 16—75) in the feces They meas 
ure 75 to 91 microns m length and 39 to 
47 microns in diameter They resemble 
hookworm ova in that they have a thin 
shell, but they are more nearly pointed at 
one end and are larger The rhabditiform 
larva possesses a characteristic small knob 
at the tip of the tail (see Table 16-21)

slightly larger Ancylastoma is larger than 
J\ecator Males possess a fan shaped bursa 
at their posterior end Spicules are separate

a pronounced dorsal flexion which is hook 
like The buccal capsule reveals diagnostic 
features In Necator cutting plates are seen 
in contrast to teetli in Ancylostoina (Tig 
16-87) 

The ova (Fig 16-88) of the two genera 
are identical except for a slight variation 
in size Ancylostoma ova are 56 to 60 nu 
crons m length and 36 to 40 microns m 
breadth whereas Necator ova are 64 to 76 
microns and 36 to 40 microns These ova 
which possess a hyaline shell are tmseg 
mented or in the four<ell stage when 
passed in the fresh stool These must be 
differentiated from Tnchostrongylus and 
Heterodera ova Occasionally larvae may 
be seen within the ova especially in stools 
that have been standing without refngera 
tion for a few dajs 

The rhabditiform larvae have a long buc 
cal cavity as evidenced by the position of 
the esophagus (see Table 16-21) These 
larvae must be differentiated from those of 


Strongyloides, Bhabditis homims, and Tn 
chostrongylus Rhabditiform larvae may ap- 
pear in cultures in a feu days but eight 
days are required for the filariforms (see 
Appendix p 936) The laboratory worker 
should be cautious when handling cultures 
containing the filariform larvae 

The Cestodes 

The cestodes or tapeworms are common 
parasites of man The adult tapeworms 
dwell in the small intestine and consist ol 
a family of segments or progloltids which 
ate attached to the wall by means of 
suckers or m some mstances by booklets 
situated on the rostellum of the scolex or 
head This chain of segments is called a 
strobila Behind the scolex is the neck re 
gion from which the worm grows longer 
Posterior to the neck one sees immature, 
mature and grand segments the latter 
bemg the oldest and displaying distinctive 
uterine designs Segments may be her 
mapbroditic Ova m the uterus generally 
are released bj disintegration of the seg 
ment but in one genus are expelled through 
a birth pore 

Tapeworms utilize one or more interme 
dlate hosts in which the larval stage is 
found Consumption of the viable larval 
stage results in infection in man 




Bacteria Protozov Helminths and Arthroeods 685 

Differentiating the tapeworms (Fig cysticerci Cysticercus celltdosae which are 


16-89 16-90) may be achieved by a study 
of their ova segments and scohces as the 
case may be To study the uterine design 
of the gravid segment press the segment 
between two wide glass slides and hold 
the segment against a good light source 
Segments \%hich may be passed singly or 
in chams are frequently brought to the 
physician These should be placed in saline 
and sent to the laboratory for identifica 
tion The *^colex however remains attached 
to the intestinal wall and the worm con 
tinues to groiv Since the necJc region be 
hind the scolex is the source from which 
the worm grows it is imperative to search 
for the head folloiving therapy The entire 
post therapy specimen should he submitted 
to the laboratory where a search should be 
made by straining the specimen through a 
coarse sieve 

Taenm solium is the porh tapeworm oc 
cumng wherever man consumes raw or 
insufficiently cooked pork but it is ex 
tremely rare in the United States Infective 


small bladders containing a scolex are 
found m the pork Man also may harbor 
the cysticerci Extraordmary caution should 
be taken by the laboratory technologist in 
handhng the adult worm or stools contain 
ing Tnema ova since the ova are immedl 
ately mfective 

TTie adult worm is 2 to d meters in 
length and although numerous cysticerci 
may be swallowed usually only one worm 
develops to maturity The scolex (Fig 
16-90) has four suckers and a rostellum 
with a double row of 25 to 30 booklets 
therefore it is an armed scolex The 
gravid segments (Fig 16-90) are longer 
than they are wide and contam a branched 
uterus From the mam uterine stem 7 to 
14 mam branches arise on one side only 
This number is of diagnostic importance 
because it differentiates these segments 
from those of T saginata Species diagnosis 
cannot be made on the basis of ova alone 
because the eggs of the taemas are mot 
phologically identical (Fig 16-89) These

Tnenta saginata the beef tapeuorm of 
man is commonly found m the United 
States This worm may be 4 to 10 meters 
m length mth as many as 2000 segments 
thus it IS larger than T sohttm Usually 
only one worm develops to matunty even 
though many cysticerci may be consumed 
m raw or msufficiently cooked beef The 
scolex (Fig 16-90) has four suckers but 
IS “unarmed” and about the size of a large 
pmhead The gravnd segments (Fig 16-90) 
are longer than they are wide and are 
characterized by the presence of 15 to 30 
mam lateral branches on one side of the 
uterme stem The ova (Fig 16-89) cannot 
be differentiated from those of T solium 
They are however infective for cattle but 
not for man In the musculature of cattle 
the larv'al stage (_Cysticercus boils') develops 
and serves as the source of infection for 
man (Fig 16-91) 

The dwarf tapeworm Htjmenolepis nana, 
differs from the larger tapeworms In that 
there may be hundreds of adult worms m 
a host whereas only one of the other tape- 
worms of man develops to matunty 


The adult (Fig 16-92) is 1 to 4 5 cm 
long and 0 4 to 0 7 mm wide The “armed’’ 
rostellum may be mvaginated or evaginated 
and enabraces 24 to 30 booklets Segments 
which may number 200 are broader than 
long Eggs escape only when the segments 
disintegrate Charactenstic ova (Fig 16- 
89) are found by routine stool examina 
tion but in light infections sedimentation 
is helpful They are hyaline and nearly 
sphencal and possess a thin outer shell and 
a hexacanth embryo From each pole arise 
four to eight slender filaments or hair like 
structures which spread toward the center 
over the embryo Considerable focusmg 
may be necessary to locate these filaments 
These eggs are immediately infective thus 
hypeimfection may occur \Vhen swallowed 
they hatch m the small intestme and the 
onchospheres burrow into the vilh where 
they become cysticercoid larvae These 
leave the vtHi and descend farther down 
the small intestine where they attach them 
selves and grow to maturity 

Hymenolepis dimimita, the rat tape 
worm measures 20 to 60 cm in length 
and about 4 mm m width The scolex is 
“unarmed” but there are four suckers The

microns by 24 to 40 microns (Fig 16-89)

and which may be observed in the stool, 
are of diagnostic importance. They are 
broadly oval and bro>vn in color 'with a 
thick shell, possessing an outer thickening 
that is frequently striated. There are no 
polar filaments but there is an onchosphere. 

Dipylidium caninum or the dog tape- 
worm causes dipylidiasis in man, more par- 
ticularly in children who may acquire the 
infection by accidentally ingesting infected 
fleas from infested pets, such as cats and 
dogs. 

Adult D. caninum range from 15 to 70 
cm. in length. The scolex is "armed." The 
mature and gravid proglottids have a bi- 
lateral set of reproductive organs and are 
longer than they are ■wide. The ova, 36 to 60 
microns in diameter, arc found in clusters 


or packets in the stool. Each cluster may 
have 8 to 25 ova, each ovum containing 
sLv booklets. 

Diphyllobothrium latum, the broad fish 
tapeworm, is the animal parasite causing 
dlphyllobothriasis in man. Man becomes in- 
fected upon consuming infected fresh- 
water fish, which are eaten raw or im- 
properly cooked. The adult worms may 
teach a length of 10 meters with as many 
as 3000 segments, and generally only one 
worm develops, Mthough multiple infec- 
tions are known, in which case the worms 
are smaller. The “unarmed” scolex (Fig 
16-90) is characteristically spoon-shaped 
and possesses two slit-like grooves, or 
bothria, which are placed laterally. The 
mature and gravid proglottids are broader

Taenia sohurn (Cysticcrcosis) Cysticer 
cosis is the disease in man caused by the 
larval stage Cysticercus cellulosae of the 
tapeworm Taenia sohurn Thus man may 
sene as the mtermediate as well as the 
definime host of the pork tapeworm The 
eggs are infective for man therefore there 
IS danger of infection from handlmg the 
adult worms or becoming contaramated

Ee/inwcocciis grantilostis (Hydatid Dxs

Ecfnnococctis granulosus Dogs harbor the 
adult worm usually m great numbers 
Man cattle and sheep sene as intermedi 
ate hosts for the larval stage of hydatid 
cysts (Fig 16-98) which cause echino- 
coccosis or hydatid disease 

The adult worm the smallest of the tape- 
worms IS 2 5 to 5 0 nun long and is com 
posed of a scolex and neck and immature 
mature and gravid proglottids The gravid 
segment contains many ova which resem 
ble those of Taenia Ova from dog feces 
reach the digestive system of man where 
the hexacanth embryos are set free and 
find their way to the liver lungs or other 
organs in which they slowly develop into 
hydaud cysts which vary considerably m 
size From the inner layer of the cyst wall 
brood capsules and daughter cysts bud 
Within the former scohees or "hydatid 
sand” (Fig 16-99) bud Brood capsules 
with “hydatid sand" inside develop within 
the daughter cysts This sand is composed 
of ovoid orgamsms which are 0 2 to 0 3 
mm long and have four lateral suckers and 
an “armed” rostellum which may be in 
vagmated or evagmated This type of by 
datid is knovvji as the unilocular cyst Two 
other types may occur (he alveolar or

raultUocular, and the osseous, which in- 
volves the bones. Some cysts may be sterile, 
i.e., without the “hydatid sand.” 

Laboratory diagnosis may be made by 
finding the scolices, brood capsules, or 
daughter cysts in the cysts after surgical 
removal. Skin testing and x-ray are also 
aids in diagnosis. 

MuIlicefJS inulticeps (Coenurus Disease). 
Multiceps multiceps adult worms are found 
in dogs and the larval stage (coenurus), in 
cattle, sheep, and man. The disease is 
known as coenurosis. 

Ingested ova hatch in the small intes- 
tine where the onchosphere penetrates the 
intestinal wall, enters the circolalion, and 
migrates to various sites in the body, par- 
ticularly the central nervous system. The 
embryo transforms into a bladder-type 


worm, the coenurus, ^vhich differs from a 
cysticercus by possessing multiple heads 
invaginated from the wall into the bladder 
cavity. Diagnosis is made at autopsy. 

Spargannsis. Man may acquire the spar- 
ganum, the lar\-al stage of a species of 
Diphyliohothriiim, by ingestion of the in- 
fected fresh-water copepod Diopfomns, by 
ingesting raw infected flesh of certain 
frogs, snakes, and birds; or by applying a 
poultice of infected flesh of frogs on open 
wounds or the eye. 

The sparganum, tvhicb can be removed 
by surgery, is distinguished by its elongated 
ribbon shape tvith no transverse segmenta- 
tion but »vith a pseudosucker and no .scole.v. 
The li\1ng spargana elongate and contract 
like typical tapeworms.

TrichmeUa spiralis Tnchinella spiralis 
IS the trichina worm responsible for pro 
ducing the disease known as trichinosis 
tnchmiasis or tnchmelliasis The adult 
worms inhabit the small intestine where 
the females give birth to hvmg larvae 
which migrate to the skeletal muscles of 
the body alter entering the circulatory sys 
tem The larvae coil themselves m the 
muscle fibers and become encapsulated 
(Fig 16-104) and eventually the capsule 
becomes calcified 

Man becomes infected after the con 
sumption of insufficiently cooked or raw 
pork or pork products containuig encap 
sulated larvae Pigs are mfected from un 
cooked garbage the infected meat is 

ingested by humans the ingested encap 
sulated larvae are released and penetrate 
into the mucosa of the mtesune and there 
develop into adults m several days The 
adult males measure 2 mm or less vvith a 
breadth of 0 04 mm while the females 
are 2 to 4 mm long and 0 06 mm wide 
These adults may be observed micro 
scopically in the stools of patients with 
diarrhea during the first few weeks of the 
infection They live in the mtestine about 
eight weeks before they die 

The diagnosis m humans usually rests 
upon the history of having eaten im

Bacteria, Protozoa, Helminths, and Arthropods 


Scorpions. Scorpions (Fig. 16-107) sting 
their prey and introduce neurotoxic venom 
by means of their caudal stinger. An 
ascending paralysis may be accompanied 
by respiratory failure, especially in chil- 
dren. The adult scorpions occur in and 
around houses in warm moist or dry areas 
and are nocturnal or hide themselves in 
dark places. 

Spiders. The black widow spider, Latro- 
dectus viactans (Fig. 16-108), is the best 
known of the poisonous spiders and is 
widely distributed throughout the western 
hemisphere. 

The adult female L. niactans is a lustrous 
black on its dorsal surface, and a diagnostic 
red spot, which usually resembles an hour- 
glass, appears on the raidventural surface. 


Hie spherical abdomen gives the spider the 
appearance of a shoebutton, a name by 
which it is sometimes called. 

. The spider inliabits trash piles, out- 
houses, hollow stumps, lumber piles, cel- 
lars, and garages. The females are about 
13 mm. In length, and the males are about 
half this size. 

yirac/niulfsm (slmler poisoning). As the 
spider bites the human \ictim, the toxin is 
injected into the skin. Within one hour 
severe pain develops with redness and swell- 
ing at the site of the bite. Abdominal 
cramps develop followed by pains in the 
muscles of the legs, chest, and back In 
time, marked board-like rigidity develops. 
These acute symptoms may persist for 
J2 to 48 hours. Accompanying the muscu-

The rickettsial diseases transmitted are 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever, 
fievre boutonneuse, and tick typhus. Viral 
diseases transmitted are Russian spring- 
summer encephalitis and Colorado tick 
fever. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, is 
also transmitted. Dennacentor andersoni, 
a hard-bodied tick, is the chief vector of 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

jury of their bites, by transmission of micro- 
organisms, and by tick paralysis. 

Tick paralysis. This disease occurs 
mostly in young children and is character- 
ized by an ascending flaccid paralysis. The 
tick is attached to the body, usually near 
the base of the brain or along the spmal 
column. The disease has a rapid onset and 
death may occur. Removal of the tick 
usually results in gradual recession of pa- 
ralysis and abatement of symptoms. 

Mites. Mites are smaller and longer than 
ticks and do not have a leathery integu- 
ment. The hypostome, if present, may be 
without teeth. On the cephalothorax of 
some mites spiracles are present. Mites 
serve as vectors of certain human diseases. 
They may penetrate the skin directly, caus- 
ing injury, as in scabies. 

Sarcoptes scabiei, the itch mite (Figs. 
16-111, 16-112), is cosmopolitan in its 
distribution and causes a disease known as 
scabies or sarcoptic mange in man. The 
female is about 0.5 mm. in length, and the 
male is smaller. The adults tunnel in the 
superficial layers of the skin (Fig. 16-113),

to feed at mght They are brown, flattened, 
o\Jil insects without ivings The area of the 
bite may produce swelling itching, and 
scratching and may produce secondary bac

experimentally as earners of pathogenic 
organisms 

The Reduviidae are the kissing bugs The 
reduviid bugs or “cone nose bugs” (Fig 16- 
120) feed on blood, and certain species are 
responsible for the transmission of Cha 
gas s disease, which is caused by the hemo- 
flagellate, Tryjmnosoma cruzi One out- 
standing species is Panstrongylus megistus 
(Tnatotna magtsta) The bite of the bug is 
not always painful The infective stage of 
T cruzt IS deposited with the feces, and the 
puncture wound becomes contaminated

The Diptera are the true flies and include 
mosquitoes and flies They usually have two 
wings with the halteres as the second pair 
The mouthparts are adapted for sucking 
and m some instances for piercing 

Mosquitoes are flies that are slender and 
dehcate Those that suck blood play an 
important role in the transmission of 
human diseases, such as malana, illanasis,

dengue, yello^v fever, and some of the 
encephaliudes The mosquitoes can be dif 
ferentiated from other flies by the presence 
of scales on the 'vvings and a proboscis, 
which IS adapted for piercing and suckmg 
The antennae are long with 15 jomts 
Many species of the several genera of 
mosquitoes serve as vectors of human dis 
eases The genera incrimmated are Anoph 
eles, Culex, Aedes, and Mnnsonia Differen 
tial diagnosis is based upon many varied 
morphologic structures, details of which 
can be found in textbool,s on entomology 
The principal differences between cuhcine 
and anopheline mosquitoes are shown in 
Figs 16-121 and 16-122 

The IVonbJoodsuching Phes. The non 
bloodsucking flies are the filth flies, which 
have fleshy mouthparts adapted for suck 
mg liquids The adult flies may be me 
chanical transmitters of disease, but the 
larvae may Invade the broken or unbroken 
skm or develop from mgested fly eggs to 


produce a condition knomi as myiasis (see 
Fig 16-123) 

Sliectfic Eggs or larvae from 

cenam flJth ^es are deposited on the 
tissues of the specific host, and the larva 
becomes parasitic as it invades the area 
Examples of flies that produce this type of 
myiasis are the screvvvvorm Calhphorn 
(Cochliomyta) amencana and C macel 
larta the botfly, Dennatobia hominis, the 
sheep botfly. Oestrus ouis, the cattle botfly, 
Hypodenna, and Gasterophilus 

Setnispecific mytasis Eggs or larvae of 
the semispecific flies are deposited in rot 
tmg vegetable matter or m open wounds 
and sores 

Acndeiiial mywsts Eggs of the acci 
dental myiasis producing flies are laid m 
feces or decaymg organic matter or on food 
Man becomes infected bj ingestion of the 
eggs or larvae or by contamination of 
wounds Examples are Alusca dome$tica 
and Fannia

Culex (Cutexpipiens) show

antennae The male is dis 
tmgulshed from the female 
by the longer hairs on the 
antennae Note that the 
palpi of the male are about 
as long as the proboscis, 
while those of the female 
are very much shorter (com

Speed and accuracy have always been of 
great importance in the clinical bacteriology 
laboratory and the advent of numerous 
specific chemotherapeutic and antibiotic 
drugs has served to re*emphasize this need 
Improved methods for the isolation and 
identification of microorganisms are con 
stantly being developed and it is impera 
tive that medical bacteriologists constantly 
re*evaluate their techniques with the view 
of adapting new equipment and media to 
their own routines Fortunately improved 
media both for routine and special purposes 
are now available in dehydrated form or 
already prepared in tubes or plates and can 
be obtained from several commercial 
sources It is no longer necessary and in 
most cases is not desirable to go through 
the lime consuming procedure of preparing 
media from basic ingredients Certain gen 
era! principles may be used to guide the 
laboratory in its operation 

In some cases the direct gram stained 
smear may permit tentative identification 
of an organism but most often culture on 
appropriate media is essential for both the 
tentative and final identifications To that 
end appropriate inoculations on certain 
basic media have to be made In order to 
choose the proper procedure the nature and 
source of the material to be cultured must 
be known and some information about the 
condition of the patient should be available 
The latter will help to select the suitable 
t)pe of examination and the most direct 
approach for the isolation and identification 
of the offending microorganism 

With the battery of antibiotic drugs now 
available it is in many cases desirable to 
know the antibiotic susceptibility of an or 


ganism at the earliest possible moment At 
times this is of more immediate importance 
than •>n exact identification For that pur 
pose pure cultures of the organism have 
to be available for testing Consequently 
antibiotic testing techniques are a part of 
bacteriologic methods and will be dealt 
with in that way here and not as a sep 
araie subject 

There are points in the operation of a 
diagnostic microbiologic laboratory that 
cannot be overemphasized Proper collec 
tlon of material for examination and Its 
transport to the laboratory arc of utmost 
importance No matter how good the meth 
ods used in the laboratory it is not possible 
to get satisfactory resu/fs with specimens 
that arc collected Improperly or delayed 
unduly in arnving at the laboratory Under 
ro circumstances should a specimen amv 
ing at the laboratory with any of the in 
fectious matenol on the outside of the con 
tamer be accepted because there may be 
potentially serious consequences to those 
handling the specimen Thus there should 
b« complete understanding and free ex 
change of infonnation between the physi 
Clan and those examining the material in 
the laboratory both before and during the 
course of the procedure 

In the laboratory the proper operation 
depends upon the availability of properly 
cleaned and sterilized glassware and the 
preparation appropriate handling and 
choice of media and reagents These arc 
basic in the operation of the laboratory In 
the actual operation it Is of course essential 
to adequately organize standardize and do 
velop the techniques of preparation stain 
mg and culturing specimens Accuracy

speed, and efficiency are to be emphasized 
The prompt recording and reporting of re 
suits are important When possible^jj^terun 
reports can be of great assistance ' 

In smaller laboratones physicians’ of- 
fices, and clinics where space, time and 
personnel are bmited it is possible to ac 
complish a great deal \vith simple methods 
and a minimum of material In larger lab 
oratones more extensue procedures can be 
made available and more extensive service 
offered The size of the laboratory does not 
necessarily determine the amount or quality 
of the services rendered, for experience, 
organization and ingenuity can accomplish 
a great deal 

GENERAL TECHNIQUES OF MICRO 
BIOLOGIC EXAMINATIONS 

ir<u/iiHg GInssiiare 

The efficiency of a laboratory can be 
greatly influenced by the availability of an 
adequate supply of glassware and con 
tamers Ideally there should be on hand two 
or three times the amount required for da) 
to-day operation in order to preside a turn 
over and to allow for efficient cleaning and 
sterilizing The glassware itself should be 
of good qualit) and the test tubes, flasks 
and Petri dishes should not be of soft glass 
if this can be avoided There are now avail 
able certain disposable items such as 
plastic Fetn dishes (either plain or divided 
into two three, or four sections), plastic 
syringes, pipets, and coverslips Other simi 
lar items are bemg developed continuous!) 
and will no doubt offer considerable ad 
vantages in ceriam situations 

Adequate cleaning of glassware is es 
sential to insure the best results in micro 
biologic work It is no longer necessar) or 
desirable to use dichromate cleaning solu 
tion although there are times when it is 
useful For almost all purposes a good de 
tergent cleaner is adequate Test tube wash 
ers and mechanical glassware washers of 
various sizes and complexity are a\ailable 
for use in an) size laborator) In the ab 
sence of such a machine, washing cm be 
accomplished in a sink, using stiff bristle 
bnishes to assist in the removal of solids 
grcise, and dirt from the glassivare After 
being washed the glassware should be 
nnsed several times in running tap water 
to remove all detergent and then passed 
through at least three or four rinses in dis 
tilled water After being nnsed the glass 
ware should be dried in an inverted position 


in an oven or allovvcd to dry at room tern 
perature on a clean dust free table This 
lyill suffice for test tubes flasks, and Petri 
di$hes but pipets and slides require special 
comment 

In general the same washing procedure 
can be used with pipets as with other glass 
ware, but rmsmg requires special care For 
this purpose an automatic pipet washer 
serves best although nnsing can be ac 
compUshed by holding the pipets under the 
water tap and then rmsmg m distilled 
water New slides should be washed with 
detergent, nnsed and immersed in 95 per 
cent alcohol They should then be wiped 
dry with a soft Imt free cloth and stored in 
a covered contamer or slide dispenser Used 
slides should be cleaned with an abrasive 
soap, such as Bon Ami, before washing in 
detergent This is important because it is 
necessary to remove all adherent bacteria 
and debns If bacteria are left on the slide 
there may be difficult) m interpreting sub 
sequent gram stains Etched slides should 
be discarded since bactena or other mate 
rial may be caught in crevices and may not 
be removed on cleaning One can obtain 
prevvashed slides commercially if desired 

Fluggingj Co/>/}ing, mid Atsembl) of 
Classnnre 

Before sterilization of test tubes flasks 
and pipets it is necessary that they be 
plugged with cotton or that a cap be ap- 
plied If cotton plugs are to be used, it is 
desirable to use a good grade of long fiber 
nonabsorbent cotton Synthetic plastic 
materials for plugging are now available 
Many workers prefer a rolled plug made 
by taking an appropriate size portion of the 
cotton and rolhng it to a diameter that fits 
snugly into the orifice of the tube or flask 
If Kepi dr), such plugs may be used repeal 
edl) The plugs should be of sufficient 
length to extend about one inch into the 
tube leaving enough outside for eas) rc 
moval Other workers merely stuff the cot 
ton Into the opening with a pencil or similar 
tool Such plugs cannot be reused For large 
tubes or flasks it is desirable to wrap tlie 
cotton In a double layer of gauze Such 
plugs should fit snuglj into the onficc and 
ma) be tied with string to form i llltlc bag 
There arc several alternatives to the use 
of cotton plugs for lubes and flasks Screw 
cap tubes and flasks of man> sizes arc aval! 
able The) have the great advantage of 
dcla)'ing evaporation of stored media and 
reagents and have found wide use in the

laboratory One can also use caps of alu 
muium stainless steel or certain other 
materials 

Pluggmg of pipets must be done wth 
care If the plug is too tight it ivill offer too 
much resistance and make it difficult to 
draw up matenals and if it is too loose 
the plug may shp down into the barrel of 
the pipet and contaminate what it touches 
Pipets can be obtained with constrictions 
which pre\ent the dropping of the plug 
After bemg plugged the pipets can be 
wrapped mdividually in paper or packed in 
special!) designed stainless steel cans for 
stenlization and storage 

Petn dishes should be assembled after 
drying and may be ivrapped in paper either 
singly or in packages of tivo to four before 
stenhzation Metal cans with removable 
racks provide an efficient means of pack 
mg and storing Petri dishes (Fig 17-1) 

Syringes may be wrapped in paper either

Stenlizatton of Glasmare and Reaf’ents 

There are four general methods of ster 
ihzing glassware and reagents each of 
which has its special advantages depend 
mg on the material and its projected use 
These are moist heat (autoclaving or in 
spissatmg) drj heat (oven) filtration and 
use of chemic^ agents 

Moist heat sterilizing is most frequently 
accomplished by using steam under pres 
sure m an autoclave or pressure cooker 
Many types and sizes of autoclaves are 
used horizontal or vertical single or double 
wall gas or electrically heated or opera 
non on a steam Ime (Figs 17-2 17 3) 
There are single or double wall automatic 
or manually operated machines suitable for 
any laboratory Small table model elec 
tncally operated autoclaves have been de 
veloped recently and can be used in small 
laboratories or physicians offices These 
have many advantages over the pressure 
cooker The standard autoclaving procedure 
requires a pressure of 15 lb per square inch 
and a temperature of 121* C (250* F ) 
for 15 mmutes for most materials In 
manually operated autoclaves it is impera 
tire that all the air be allowed to escape 
before closing the escape v ahe since air

steam mixtures ivill not produce the re 
quired temperature e\en though the pres 
sure IS the required 15 lb ^Vhen large 
quantities of material are bemg autoclaved. 
It may be necessary to stenlUe for more 
than 15 mmutes to insure proper sterility 
One can use heat indicators of \anous 
types that are designed to record the tem- 
perature reached inside packages 
Most of the routine m^ia and salt solu 
tions used in the laboratory may be sler- 
ihzed by autoclaving However, certain 
media contammg carbohydrates, serum, or 
egg and solutions of vitamins or other 
growth factors may be damaged by the 
autoclave temperature Such materials may 
be sterilized by filtration or inspissation 
Glassware may be sterilized in the auto- 
clave, but It is then necessary to provide 
some means of drying Most double wall 
autoclaves can be run under vacuum and 
evacuated after the stenlizatjon is complete 
in order to remove moisture 

Dry heat stenhzation is accomphshed in 
an oven either operated by gas or elec- 
tricity Such stenluation requires a higher 
temperature and a longer time than auto- 
claving A good standard to use is 160° C 
for two hours This temperature will not 
char paper, cotton, or gauze In packing 
matentd in an oven for sterilization, it is 
important to leave adequate space on the

shelves to aUow for free circulation of air 
If this IS not done, the material on the 
lower shelves closest to the source of heat 
will get too hot, while the upper shelves 
may not reach the required temperature 
(Fig 17-1) 

Test tubes, pipets, Petn dishes flasks 
syringes, and needles should be sterilized 
in dry heat, since it is desirable that these 
matenaJs be dry for use and for storage 
Rubier goods and certain other matenals 
are adversely affected and must not be 
sterilized m an oven When sterilizing screw 
cap glassware, it is desirable to leave the 
caps slightly loose durmg sterilization and 
to tighten them after removal from the 
oven 

Hmidhtig Coiitamwated Matertals 

The problem of disposal of contaminated 
glassware, media, swabs and specimen car 
tons in a laboratory is of considerable im 
portance in order to avoid spread of in 
fectious matenal throughout the laboratory 
area and us surroundings and to avoid 
cross-contammation of media which may 
result in serious errors All bench tops 
should be of good construction with a hard 
smooth surface and should be kept unclut 
tered They should be washed frequently 
with a good disinfectant 

Porcelain or stainless steel containers 
with snug fiiung tops are needed for the 
discard of contaminated glassware Butcher 
pans, which can be obtained from res 
taurant supply houses, are quite good For

pipets one can use cylindrical jars or tec 
tangular pans containing disinfectant 
These items should be placed conveniently 
to provide ready access Once an item is dis 
carded it should never be removed from 
the discard pan until the pan and its con 
tents have been autoclaved After autoclav 
mg the glassware can be removed and 
washed Pipets do not ordinarily need to be 
autoclaved provided they are sufficiently 
immersed m disinfectant 

Specimen cartons applicators tongue 
depressors cotton and other combustible 
materials should be discarded mto a gar 
bage pail with a tight cover Lining the pail 
with a waterproof paper bag is recom 
mended so that the bag can be removed 
and placed directly into an incinerator All 
mfecUous materials such as sputum from 
tuberculous pauents must be autoclaved 
before they are discarded 

Preparation Dispensvie, ant! Stenlization 
of Media 

Most of the media used m diagnosQc 
work can now be obtained from several 
sources in dehydrated form Each of the 
firms producing such media has descriptive 
catalogues or pamphlets which give m 
gredients recommended use and method 
of preparation for each medium The pnn 
ciples of preparing dispensmg and stenliz 
ing media are essentially the same whether 
one uses the dehydrated form or starts from 
the beginning and adds the vanous in 
gredients separately All the basic media 
contain a peptone and certam salts to which 
may be added growth promotmg substances 
or agar depending on the need Since 
numerous peptones of superior quality are 
now available commercially it is no longer 
necessary to prepare infusions and extracts 
although this may be desirable for large 
laboratories for reasons of economy 

There should be available a good balance 
for weighing the mgredients of the medium 
If dehydrated media are used one does not 
need an analytic balance but may use a 
good trip balance or its equivalent But if 
one IS to make media adding all the in 
gredients individually an analytic balance 
should be used 

Instructions for reconstituting dehy 
drated media are giv en on the label of each 
bottle and it is only necessary to weigh out 
the required amount of the powder and to 
add distilled water It is important to use 
an Erlenmever flask of sufficient size to 
allow adequate stirrmg or shakmg to dis 


solve the medium For example if one is 
making one liter of medium it is desirable 
to use a two-liter flask If the medium does 
not contain agar, it may dissolve without 
heatmg but all media containing agar re 
quire the application of heat to raise the 
temperature to 100“ C or thereabouts This 
heating should never be done over an open 
flame because there is danger of scorching 
the medium or breaking the flask The flask 
should be placed in a boiling water bath 
and stirred or shaken thoroughly at fre 
quent interv als until the agar is melted One 
can determine when the agar is melted by 
inspecting the sides of the flask during 
shakmg If flecks of agar can be seen the 
agar is obviously not melted and heat 
ing should be continued These media 
should be dispensed into appropriate con 
tamers while still hot (above 45“ C ) else 
they will solidify and need to be remelied 
If prolonged heating is necessary volume 
may be decreased owmg to ev aporation and 
It may be necessary to add distilled water 
to replace the loss Certain types of dehy 
draied media can be dissolved without 
heating Direcuons to this effect are sup 
pbed with the media 

Except under special circumstances no 
pH adjustment is necessary with dehydrated 
media When this is necessary or when one 
starts with basic ingredients relatively 
simple methods of adjustment are avail 
able (see p 735) A pH of about 7 0 is 
used for most bacteriologic work although 
some bactena require higher or lower pH 
values 

The methods of dispensmg the dissolved 
media mto tubes or flasks depends on the 
type of medium and the purpose for which 
It is to be used Fluid media (e g infusion 
broth) may be pipetted mto tubes usmg a 
serologic pipet or an automatic pipet call 
brated to dehver the desired amount It is 
not necessary to use sterile tubes for this 
purpose although at tunes this has con 
siderable advantage especially m handling 
maienal that needs to be inspissated For 
larger instillations one may use specially 
constructed flasks with delivery tubes at 
the bottom to which may be attached a 
standard glass filling device 

Media containing agar must be dispensed 
while hot (50“ C or above) Media con 
taiiung sufficient agar to be sohd on coolmg 
(1 5 per cent or more) are used ordinarily 
for agar slants or Petn dishes For slants 
the medium is dispensed into test tubes 
autoclaved m the vertical position and then 
cooled in a slanted position on the table 



Microbiolocic Methods 


715 


lop The amount of medium per tube is 
determined by the length of slant and butt 
desired To pour Petri plates the agar 
medium must first be sterilized in flasks or 
tubes and then poured to a depth of to 

Inch into sterile plates Since the medium 
tends to dry out when stored in Petn 
dishes owing to the large surface the 
medium should be stored in flasks or test 
tubes, melted in a boiling water bath and 
poured into the Petri dish just before use 
The melted agar is cooled to 50 to 55® C 
before pouring the plates to prevent con 
densation of moisture on the walls of the 
container Semisolid media (0 1 to 0 75 per 
cent agar) are tubed and sterilized in the 
same manner as fluid media 

It is often necessary to add carbohydrates 
or other substances to media for special 
studies In some instances these materials 
can be weighed and dissolved in the me 
dium before stenbzation but in other cases 
heat may adversely affect the substance and 
It must be added aseptically to the ster 
Ilized base For carbohydrate fermentation 
tests it IS necessary to use a base medium 
free of carbohydrate to which the desured 
carbohydrate such as dextrose or maltose 
IS then added to produce a 0 S to 1 0 per 
cent concentration It is convenient to add 
the desired carbohydrate aseptically using 
a filtered 10 to 20 per cent solution to a 
previously sterilized base medium Such 
base media containing an indicator (brom 
thymol blue bromcresol purple or phenol 
red) are readily available The inAcator 
changes color when acid is produced by 
bacteria 

To detect gas production one can place 
an inverted vial or Durham lube (3 X 20 
mm ) m the medium (Fig 17 5) When 
autoclaved this vial fills with medium Gas 
production is mdicated when a bubble of 
gas appears in the vial after bacterial propa 
gation If one uses semisolid agar (0 5 per

cent agar) the vial is unnecessary because 
gas production will bs revealed by bubbles 
in the medium 

There are now available sterile discs of 
dehydrated fermentation media which 
when added aseptically to tubes with sterile 
distilled water, provide a medium for fer 
mentation tests There are also discs con 
taming various carbohydrates that may be 
added to a suitable base m the same man 
ner or may be placed on agar plates These 
materials seem ideally suited for use m 
small laboratories 

For sterilization of media in most cases 
autoclaving at 15 lb pressure for 15 mm 
utes IS satisfactory If the medium is in 
screw cap tubes the caps should be left 
loose before autoclaving and tightened after 
removal from the autoclave Some carbo- 
hydrates and other materials are changed 
or destroyed by the high temperatures 
Media containing carbohydrates Loefilers 
medium and certain of the media for TB 
cultures (Petragnam and Lowensteins 
media for example) can be inspissated by 
exposing the media to free flowing steam m 
an inspissator for one hour on each of three 
successive days There are various types of 
inspissators and Arnold sterilizers available 
(Fig 17-6) 

Ailjusting the Hydrogen Ion (riH) Con 
centraiion of Culture Media Tne colon 
metne method for the adjustment of the 
pH of culture media is widely used and 
has the advantages of speed and simplicity 
Tljere are limitations to this procedure 
however and for more accurate work a 
potentiometer ( pH meter ) is necessary

2000 ml of medium to be adjusted to a pH 
of 7 8 and it requires 0 6 ml of N/10 
NaOH to bring the tube containing 10 ml 
of medium to the same color as the stand

hon of this amount would increase the 
>olume too much it is necessary to add 
12 0 ml of N/1 NaOH

Most media particularly those containmg 
carbohydrates become slightl) mote acid

able to make a check determination on a 
10 ml portion of the stenhzed product that 
has been withheld for this purpose 

The same procedure can be followed 
using HCl if the medium is too alkaline 
although this is seldom necessary Other 
indicators besides bromthymol blue can also 
be used (Table 17-1) 

Determination of the pH after growth of

the culture and testing them m the po* 
tentiometer Proper precautions must be 
taken when testing cultures of pathogenic 
bacteria A simpler method is the spot plate 
procedure One loopful of culture is placed 
in the conca%e depression of a white por 
celam plate One drop of indicator soluuon 
IS mixed and the pH estimated by noting 
the resulting color and comparmg it to the 
color chart for the indicator used Another 
procedure is to add one or more drops of 
indicator solution to 1 0 ml aliquots of the 
culture that have been transferred to small 
test tubes The same amount of indicator 
solution IS added to 1 0 ml \olumes of 
standard buffer solutions in similar tubes 
The standard tube most closely matchmg 
the unknown is determmed by wsual ex 
aminauon 

In the case of the Clostridia it is best 
to read the pH after growth by the spot 
plate procedure just described because 
many strains will destroy the indicator m 
the media rapidly and thus give erroneus 
results 

Preparation of Blood and Cliocolatc 
Agar Media containing nhole blood are 
the most commonly employed media in the 
diagnostic laboratory and the type of blood 
the agar base and the technique of prepara 
tion are aery important for the proper isola 
tion of microorganisms 

The type of blood used in making blood 
or chocolate agar depends in most cases on 
what IS available Some laboratories can 
get human blood from blood banks others 
have access to defibnnated rabbit sheep 
or horse blood Although certain of these 
may have advantages over others in special 
situations any one is satisfactory for most 
purposes The blood should not be more 
than a few days old unless collected in a 
special preserving solution such as Al 
sever s If the blood is too old the red cells 
are likely to be fragile and may hemoij’ze 
making the blood agar unsuitable for use 

There are several good blood agar bases 
that can be obtained commercially One 
should not use just any peptone agar be 
cause some contain agents detrimental to 
the blood and the results will be undtsir 
able 

To make blood agar the stenlc blood agar 
base contained in a flask is melted in a 
Itoilmg water bath and cooled to 50 to 
55" C (This cooling is essential because 
higher temperatures will adversely affect 
the blood when it is added to the agar ) 
Blood is then added to the melted agar (5 
ml of blood per 100 ml of medium) and

thoroughly mixed by rotating the flask 
After It IS mLxed, the agar is carefully 
poured into sterile Petn dishes to a depth of 
Ys to *4 ^ch The depth to which the plate 
IS poured is of considerable importance, 
since one is often interested in the presence 
or absence of hemolysis If the agar is too 
thick, the hemoljsis may be missed Too 
vigorous shaking should be a\oided, since 
air bubbles may make the agar rough 
Air bubbles that do appear in the plates 
may be remo%ed by passmg a Bunsen flame 
quicklj over the surface before the agar 
has set Some workers prefer to place a 
layer of plain agar over the bottom of the 
plate and superimpose a thin layer of 10 
per cent blood agar over this 

To make chocolate agar, the flask con 
taimng the medium with blood added is 
placed in a water bath at 70’ C and shaken 
gently until it has attained a definite choco- 
late color This takes usually about five 
mmutes Excessive heating should be 
avoided The agar should then be cooled to 
50 to 55* C and poured mto sterile Petn 
dishes 

Blood and chocolate agar can be stored 
m the refrigerator at 4* C for several days 
but should not be used if there is evidence 
of excessive drying or, in the case of blood 
agar plates, if the blood has darkened or 
oUierwise changed its appearance All blood 
and chocolate agar plates should be incu 
bated overnight and checked for sieriLty 
before use Addition of Bacto-Supplement 
B or Fildes’s peptic blood digest sumulates 
growth of the more fastidious organisms 

Preparation of Coagulated Serum or Egg 
Media The preparation of Loefllers serum 
medium and coagulated egg media jcguires 
special technique If these are autoclaved 
in the usual manner, the resultmg medium 
IS unsatisfactory for use The ingredients 
are mixed thoroughly, avoidmg bubbles, 
and tubed in the same manner as for other 
media Because these media coagulate on 
beating they must be slanted during heat 
mg They may be stenbzed by mspissadon 
They axe coagulated on the first day and 
are then merely heated in the inspissator 
on the two succeeding days for one hour 
each day 

An autoclave can be used with this type 
of medium, but special procedures must 
be used Layers of tubes should be placed 
in an enamel pan m a slanted position with 
several thicknesses of newspaper or similar 
material beneath the bottom layer of tubes, 
between the layers of tubes, and above the 
top layer to prevent too rapid heating or 


cooling Not more than two layers of tubes 
should be used, for otherwise the insulat- 
ing effect may prevent sufficient heaung of 
the middle layers Some workers use other 
materials but paper serves well The auto- 
clave is first brought up to 15 lb pressure 
without releasing the air from the inner 
chamber After about 15 minutes the air 
IS slowly released, maintammg the pressure 
at 15 lb until the air has all been replaced 
with steam and the temperature has 
reached 121° C This temperature is then 
maintained for 15 minutes and the pressure 
allowed to fall slowly If these media are 
made in screw cap tubes, the tubes may be 
stored at 4° C for indefinite periods of 
time 

Methods of Examhialion of Specimeiu 

The examination of specimens received 
in the microbiology laboratory involves two 
general types of procedures First, they may 
be examined by dhrect smear, stained or un 
stained, and, second, they may be cultured 
on appropriate media 

When certain specimens are being sub- 
mitted for bactenologic or mycologic ex 
amination, properly prepared and stained 
preparations may give excellent leads as to 
what media to inoculate or what further 
examination can be done A preliminary 
report on such observations may, as m the 
case of spinal fluid, urethral smears, and 
sputum, be of defimte value to the physician 
in the management of the patient 

Clean sbdes must be used to make 
smears, and the slide must be marked ade- 
quately for identification and for debnea- 
Uon of the area in which the smear is to 
be placed A sbde may be divided mto sev- 
eral sections with a markmg pencil and 
several smears placed on the same sbde, 
provided they are all to be stamed iden 
ucally 

One or two inoculatmg loopfuls of the 
matenal to be smeared are spread evenly 
over the designated area of the sbde and 
allowed to dry The dried smear is then 
passed rapidly through a flame to heat fix 
the material to the sbde This is an essential 
step for most staining procedures 

There are sev eral staining procedures 
used in bactenologic work, the most com- 
mon and useful bemg that of Gram or one 
of Its many modifications Loefller's methy- 
lene blue, the acid fast slam, spore stains, 
capsule stains, and flagella stains may be 
useful for special purposes

Ed ) 

Culture methods in the laboratory are 
designed for essentiall) three purposes 
isolation identification and maintenance 
or presen ation The first two are most ini 
portant in diagnostic work 

The isolation of bactena from specimens 
submitted to the laboratory is almost in 
variably accomplished by streaking on the 
surface of an agar plate The purpose of 
streaking is to spread an inoculum so as 
to insure the appearance of isolated colonies 
on incubation Most such isolated colonies 
will be pure cultures of an organism and 
ma> be picked for the next step — identifica 
lion The characteristics and the cellular 
morphology will also assist in final identi 
ficatlon It is therefore imperative that a 
suitable streaking technique be used 

A recommended technique is as follows 
With a sterile inoculating loop place two 
loopfuls of the matenal near the edge of 
the plate The loop should then be sterilized 
in the flame and allowed to cool It should 
then be applied to the material on the plate 
and streaked using a gentle pressure in the 
manner illustrated in Fig 17-8 


Each of the streaking techniques is de 
signed to insure that at some place dilution 
will be sufficient to provide isolated colonies 
for study and transfer 

The streaked plates are incubated in an 
inverted posiUon media side up at 37® C 
and examined at 24 and 48 hour intervals 
The various colonies should be observed 
carefully and mdmdual ones fished for 
gram stam and for transfer to appropriate 
media for further study Fishing of colonies 
may be done with a loop if the colony is 
well separated from other colonies but it 
may be better to use a straight wire for this 
especially if the colonies are close together 
It is essential that gram stains be done on 
all colonies to study staining characteristics 
morphology and punty 

Pour plates are sometimes used on cer 
tain types of specimens i e unne or blood 
The pour plate is made by placing a meas 
ured amount of the material in a sterile 
Petn plate and pounng in melted agar 
(cooled to 50® C ) The plate is then rotated 
to mix the material thoroughly throughout 
the medium After solidifying at room tem 
perature the plate is inverted Incubated 
at 37® C and examined for colonies This 
technique has the advantage of giving 
quantitative bacterial counts For heavily 
contaminated specimens dilution must be 
made 

Agar slants arc used frequently for 
maintenance of cultures or for certain bio 
chemical studies The slant is inoculated 
from a colony picked from a plate or from 
a broth culture A loop is used to transfer 
the inoculum to the slant and is streaked 
over the entire slant Slants are used only 
with pure cultures and are not for isola 
tion It is sometimes necessary to stab into 
the butt of a slant as with Kliglers iron 
agar for entcnc organisms Tills is done 
with a straight wire slabbing carcfuUy in 
a straight line into the center of the lube 
The stab should never be made completely 
to the bottom of the tube Slants are ex 
amincd after 24 and 48 hours of incubation 
and gram stains are made to check purity 
of the culture 

Semisolid media are used for motility or 
biochemical studies and are stabbed with a 
straight wire The stab is not extended to 
the bottom of the tube Motility is read by 
examining for migration of growth away 
from the stab line thus it is import'int that 
the stab be made with care 

Broth media (e g Infusion and extract 
media) are used for maintenance of cu! 
turcs and other studies (such as carfaohv

draie fermentation). They arc inoculated by 
transfer from colonies or other growth wth 
a loop or wire. Propagation of bacteria In 
such media is indicated by the develop- 
ment of cloudiness. It is important to ascer- 
tain growth in fermentation media, since 
failure of growth results in no change of 
the indicator and may lead to false negative 
interpretation. Gram stains should be done 
on all broth cultures to determine the purity 
of the culture and to make sure no con- 
tamination has occurred. 

For short-term storage of cultures one 
should use broth or agar slant cultures, 
since Petri dishes tend to dry out unless 
sealed with a rubber or plastic band. 

Inaibatinn in an Atmosphere of 10 Per 
Cent COj. To obtain an atmosphere of 10 
per cent carbon dioxide for assistance in 
the culture of numerous organisms, the 
simplest and probably most useful method 
is to use the candle jar. This Is simply a 
jar or can with a tightly fitting top into 
tvhich Petri dishes can be placed along 
with a smokeless candle. The candle is 
lighted and the lid sealed tightly with 
plasticine or tape. When the candle burns 
out. the atmosphere contains approximately 
10 per cent carbon dioxide. Other methods 
have been described, but most arc complex 
and not necessarily any more dependable 
than the candle jar. 

^trinerolfir Cu/tiire Melftods 

Most of the recognired pathogenic bac- 
teria are aerobic or facultatively anaerobic 
and propagate well in an atmosphere free 
of oxygen; others are microaeropljlllc. pre- 
ferring reduced oxygen concentrations. 

Several pathogenic and nonpathogcnic 
bacteria are Incapable of propagation in 
the presence of oxygen and require a low 
oxidation-reduction potential. Tbe.se are 
classified as obligate anaerobic bacteria. 

Special methods are necessary for the 
isolation and study of anaerobic bacteria. 
The techniques are essentially of three 
types; the use of media containing reduc- 
ing substances that eliminate oxygen from 
the medium; the use of media and methods 
by which oxygen can be excluded from the 
medium; and the use of anaerobic jars, 
plates, and incubators from which oxygen 
(air) can be removed and replaced with 
hydrogen or nitrogen. 

One of the most useful media for anaero- 
bic culture is Brewer’s fluid thioglycollate 
medium. This medium contains sodium thio- 
glycollate, which absorbs oxygen from the 


medium. It also contains a low concentra- 
tion of agar, which limits convection, thus 
reducing the absorption of oxygen from 
air. Cysteine or reduced iron filings may 
also be used with or In place of the sodium 
thioglycollate. Other useful media - are 
cooked meat and litmus milk, both of which 
can be obtained in dehydrated form. Before 
use these media should be heated in a boil- 
ing water bath for 10 to 15 minutes to drive 
off dissolved oxygen. 

Fluid media serv'e well for stu dy and 
identification of anaerobic baHena out are 
not generally satisfactory for isolation of 
cultures from lesions or feces unless 
handled in a special manner as with spore 
bearers (see p 722) For isolation it is 
desirable to streak plates of blood agar, in- 
fusion agar, or thioglycollate agar. Such 
plates are then placed in an anaerobic jar 
or other special container and the oxygen 
removed. The Brewer anaerobic jar is satis- 
factory for this purpose (Fig. 17-9). This 
jar is equipped xvith a special top, which 
contains an electrically heated platinum 
coil. The air is exhausted from the jar and 
replaced with hydrogen, exhausted again, 
and refilled with hydrogen. Then the jar is 
connected with electric current, which 
heats the platinum coil. This catalyzes the 
reaction between hydrogen and oj^gen to 
form water, thus removing all remaining 
oxygen. Several other types of jars or con- 
tainers are available, i.e., the Brewer 
anaerobic plate (Fig. 17-10) or Spray dish 
(Fig. 17-11), and function adequately if 
properly used.

countered wth the anaerobes is that of 
spreading overgrowth Various methods of 
avoiding this are available, such as use 
of chloral hydrate, increased agar (4 per 
cent), and certain antibiotics (poljmyxin 
B, neomycin, and similar substances) 

Most of the pathogenic anaerobes, such 
as. Cl fefani. Cl perfnngens, and Cl botu 
hnum, produce spores that are resistant to 
beat of a degree capable of destrojmg all 
vegetative bacteria It is often possible in 
attempting to culture these anaerobes from 
feces, suspected food or wound swabs to 
inoculate fluid thioglycollate cooked meal 
or infusion broth or deep agar shake tubes 
The culture is then put in a water bath at 
75° C for 10 to 15 minutes This will 
destroy all vegetative forms (aerobic or 
anaerobic) and the spores will generate at 
incubator temperature and grow out This 
ma> be more successful than attempts at 
plating (Anaerobic techniques are detailed 
m the texts of Smith (19551 imd Mackie 
and McCartney [1960] ) 

Choice of Media 

Many media are now available for use 
and one of the problems in all laboratones 
IS the choice of media for particular pur 
poses Practically, particularly m small lab- 
oratones, It IS desirable to limit the number 
of media and to choose those that offer the 
greatest usefulness Once media are chosen 
It IS important that the technologist become 
thoroughly familiar with each This is best 


accompbshed by constant use and careful 
observation Changes in media should be 
made when improved formulae become 
available but should be done with care 
Cultures on new medium should be run 
alongside the old for a time in order to de- 
cide whether or not the new medium offers 
advantages in the particular laboratory 

Media may be divided into categories as 
follows isolation media ennchment media, 
media for maintenance, identifying or dif 
ferentiating media (such as carbohydrate 
fermentation, hemolysis, or indol), and 
media for storage 

Isolation media are used to streak out 
specimens, such as urine or spmal fluid 
TTiey may be used for general isolation or 
for the selective isolation of a particular 
organism or group of orgamsms 

To be used for general isolation, a me 
dium has to be capable of supportmg a 
large variety of pathogenic and nonpatho- 
genic bactena Blood and cholocate agar are 
such media and find wide usage in rouune 
isolation work Special media are designed 
for isolation of certain bactena when their 
presence is suspected and may be used by 
larger laboratones, but for most laboratones 
blo^ and cholocate agar, used either under 
atmospheric condiuons or in the CO 3 jar, 
should serve very well These general isola 
tion media are saUsfactory with such speci 
mens as spinal fluid unne, and throat 
swabs m which the number of types of bac- 
tena is not excessive but when one deals 
mth fecal culture it becomes necessary to 
use seiective media 

Selective media incorporate substances 
inhibitory to propagation of a group of bac 
tena but allow other groups to grow Tlius, 
for enlenc culture, media such as eosm 
methylene blue (EMB) and salmonella 
shigella (SS) contain certain dyes and other 
ingredients, which inhibit gram positive or 
gamsms and allow the gram negative en 
tenc bacilli to propagate If, on the other 
hand, one wishes to isolate enterococci or 
staphylococci in enteric work, one can m 
corporate such a substance as sodium azide 
in blood agar, which inhibits the gram 
negative bacilli 

Ennchment media may be used to good 
advantage, particularly m entenc cultures 
Such media are designed to enhance the 
propagation of certam orgamsms without 
favoring othere Such a medium is Selenite 
F, which may be used to good advantage in 
the isolation of S typht from stools (see 
p 740)

and range from the fluid base with specific 
carbohj drates added through semisolid 
motility media and urea media for aid in 
identifymg members of the genus Proteus 
to the more complex media such as Klig 
let s or triple sugar iron medium for aid in 
differentiation among Salmojiella Shigella 
and Escherichia Certam media such as 
blood agar may ser\e a dual purpose In 
addition to its usefulness for primary isola 
tion blood agar is very useful in establish 
ing the tentative identity of a number of 
bactena Observations of colony morphology 
effect on blood (hemolysis) and growth 
characteristics as well as the gram staining 
characteristics and cellular morphology are 
very useful especially with gram positive 
cocci (Fig 17-12) 

Maintenance media may be of various 
tyTies Infusion broth Is satisfactory for 
many of the less fastidious organisms as 
are infusion agar slants For some organ 
Isms one needs an enriched medium and 
blood or chocolate agar slants can be used 
Certam organisms lo Diplococcus pneu 
moniae produce considerable amounts of 
acid from dextrose and tend to autolyze In 
these cases a medium with only a little fer 
mentable carbohydrate Is advisable else the 
culture may be lost In general cultures 
are best maintained by lyophihzation 

Aside from these general statements the 
experienced bactenologist must be guided 
m the choice of media for use m any ui 
stance by the type of speamen the nature 
of the suspected clinical condition and the 
results of a preliminary examination of the 
specimen such as gram stain 

In the section to follow there will be pre 


sentcd a set of procedures and certain al 
tematives for diilerentiatmg specimens of 
different types First there will be a list of 
the normal and abnormal microorganisms 
commonly found in the particular material 
or area involved and then the routine of 
isolation identification and reportmg of 
findings will be described In a later sec

small institutions

■ — "Collect on of Sputum The technique of 
collection of sputum is important not only 
to assist in the proper examination but also 
to avoid contamination of the outside of 
containers and of the surroundmgs and to 
prevent imdue nsk to those handling the 
matenal Wide-mouth bottles with screw 
caps are best but waxed paper cartons with 
tightly fitting tops may be used Ideally 
the containers should be stenle but this is 
not absolutely essential provided they have 
not been used previously or In the case of 
glass bottles have been thoroughly cleaned 
and dned The patient should be carefully 
instructed about the proper procedure be 
fore collection 

It is important to distinguish sputum 
from saliva and postnasal discharges and 
care should be taken to insure that only 
sputum IS collected It is desirable to nnse

the mouth well before collection and then 
to raise the sputum by coughing If diffi 
culty is encountered in raismg sputum it 
sometimes helps to have the patient he a 
few minutes with head and shoulders be 
low the chest Smee infants and small chil 
dren tend to swallow sputum and cannot 
be mduced to cough so readily as adults it 
IS frequently necessary to perform gastnc 
bronchial or laryngeal washmgs and to ex 
amine the aspirate This is particularly use 
ful m cases of suspected tuberculosis 

Early morning collection of sputum and 
immediate transport to the laboratory is to 
be recommended Collection over a 24 to- 
72 hour period is sometimes desirable for 
tuberculosis but this is not suitable for 
routine bacterial examination 

The procedure for exammation of spu 
turn m the laboratory depends on the sus 
pected condiUon It is always desirable to 
make direct smears and stains In acute 
bacterial pneumonias such smears often re- 
veal large numbers of organisms such as 
Dtp/ococcHS pneumoniae and Staphylococ 
CMS In certain other types of pneumonia 
(e g viral) bacteria may be very sparse 
Prompt reporting of such findings may be 
of great value to the physician in guiding 
therapy 

To make smears one should pick mate 
rial from the more purulent portion of the 
sputum flecks of mucus and especially 
any blood tinged matenal Care must be 
used m examining gram stains of such 
preparations since the morphologic appear 
ance of an organism may be misleading 
For example staphylococci quite frequently 
are seen in pairs and may be mistakenly 
reported as resembling D pneumoniae It 
IS also important to report on cytologic com 
ponents of the matenal especially pus cells 
and to note the presence of ingested 
bacteria 

Some of the matenal similar to that used 
for staining should be used for culture 
Since most of the bacteria found m acute 
pneumoma grow well on blood agar this 
IS the medium of choice The various gram 
positive cocci Staphylococcus Streptococ 
CMS and Dtplococcus found m such condi 
tions produce characteristic colonies on this 
medium and tentative idenufication can be 
made after from 18 to 24 hours incuba 
tion If the gram stain has shown small 
gram negauve bacilli one may wash espe 
cially in children to inoculate a chocolate 
agar plate (H influenzae') or if the bacilli 
are larger an EhlB plate (K pneumoniae)

the medium and predominance of organ

stained t\ith the gram stain Tentative 
identification can often be made at this 
point and a report on findings should be 
made It should be made clear that such 
reports are tentative with final identifica 
tlon to follow Further study of the iso 
lated organisms depends on the tentative 
identification It may be desirable to do 
antibiotic susceptibihty tests especially if 
such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus 
or K pneumoniae are isolated For methods 
of final identification of specific organisms

istics of the species (Chap 16) 

Examination of Sputum for Vcid fast Or 
gamsms In suspected cases of tuberculosis 
special staining and cultural procedures are 
necessary Ideally inoculation into guinea 
pigs should also be done although wth

Since M^fnherciilosfs and other acid fast 
organisms cannot he stained by gram

The finding of acid fast organisms in 
sputum and gastric washings does not es 
tabhsh the diagnosis although it is highly 
suggestive Nonpathogenic acid fast organ 
isms do occur in these areas (M smeg^ 
matis and M phlei for example) and can 
only be differentiated by culture or amma! 
inoculation Thus the reports on the 
stained smear of necessity read "acid fast 
organisms seen” or no acid fast organisms 
seen ” 

Concentration techniques may be usc^

Clinical Diagnosis b\ 

routinely to prepare samples for culture 
and animal inoculation. In addition, acid- 
fast stains on smears from concentrates 
may reveal organisms when stains on the 
direct smear are negative. 

Concentration of the sputum is accom- 
plished by liquefaction, using one of sev- 
eral reagents (sodium hydroxide, sodium 
hypochlorite, trisodium phosphate). This 
not only hquefies but also destroys bacteria 
other than the acid-fast organisms so that 
they do not overgrow the culture or ad- 
versely affect the inoculated animal. 

Technique of concentration 

1. Place 2 to 4 ml. of sputum in a suit- 
able test tube, preferably a pointed cen- 
trifuge tube, and add an equal volume of 
4 per cent NaOH. 

2. Shake for five to ten minutes or until 
bquefaction has occurred. The shortest 
time is most desirable, since on longer ex- 
posure the alkali may adversely affect acid- 
fast bacteria. 

3. After bquefaction, centrifuge at 3000 
r.p.m. for 15 to 30 mmutes. 

4. Ascpucally remove the supernatant 
fluid to a disinfectant solution. 

5. Add one drop of phenol red indicator 
to the sediment. 

6. Neutralize by adding 2 N HCI drop 
by drop to a faini pink endpoint. This is 
an important step and must be done care- 
fully. 

TTie concentrate is then used to make 
smears for acid-fast staining, to inoculate 
special media'-(Lbwenstein-Jensen or Pet- 
ragnam’s, for example), or to inoculate 
gumea pigs. Penicillin (50 to 100 units) 
may be added to the concentrate to help 
inhibit the growth of contaminating or- 
gamsms. 

To inoculate media, three or four drops 
are spread over each of several slants, and 
the slants are sealed to prevent evapora- 
tion and incubated at 37° C. The media 
should be mcubated with the slant face 
horizontal for the first 24 hours to avoid 
settlmg of the entire inoculum into the 
point of the slant. Since nonpathogcnic 
acid-fast bacteria groiv faster than the 
pathogens, the appearance of colonies of 
acid-fast bacteria in the first three to eight 
days of incubation probably indicates this 
type of organism. The pathogenic add- 
fast organisms may produce dsible colonies 
in 10 to 14 days, but often this takes four 
to six weeks. For descriptions of the type 
of growth and cell morphology, see section 


Laboratorv Methods 

on basic charactenstics of species (p. 
653). 

'Animal Inoculation. The 'guinea pig is 
the animal of choice for inoculation, be- 
cause it is highly susceptible to both the 
human and bovtine strains of M. tubercu- 
losis. At least* two guinea pigs should be 
inoculated with each specimen. The in- 
oculum should be as large as possible, up 
to 0.5 ml., and may be given intraperi- 
toneally, subcutaneously in the •■groin, or 
intramuscularly in the thigh muscle. Tlie 
subcutaneous route is probably preferable, 
although some workers prefer the intra- 
muscular or intraperitoneal route to a\'oid 
local abscess formation. The animal should 
be checked weekly after the, third week, 
noting evidence of disease and enlarged 
• lymph nodes. At the end of six weeks au- 
topsy should be performed on one animal 
to examine for enlarged, caseous l>’niph 
nodes and disseminated tubercles through- 
out the various organs. Acid-fast stained 
smears from the lesions should reveal acid- 
fast bacteria. The second animal should be 
held for several more weeks before au- 
topsy. If after from four to six weeks an 
animal shows no visible evidence of Infec- 
tion, a tuberculin test may be done (0.1 
ml. of 1:100 old tuberculin administered 
subcutaneously in the flank). A positive 
test IS strong evidence of infection. Intra- 
peritoneal injection of such an animal with 
tuberculin may produce rapid death^ 

Cough Plates. The cough plate is used in 
the culture of 'Bordetella pertussis from 
cases of whooping cough. The plate is made 
with vBordet-Gengou medium (glycerin- 
potato agar containing 20 per cent blood 
and 0 3 to 1 unit of penicillin per ml.). 
The plate is held a few inches in front of 
the mouth of a child suspected of having 
whooping cough, and the child is encour- 
aged to cough on the plate. The plate is 
incubated at 37° C. for two to four days 
and checked for the appearance of typical 
hemolytic, half-pearl colonies of B. pertus- 
sis. Some workers prefer to use a naso- 
pharyngeal sivab (described in the next 
section), which is streaked on Bordet- 
Gengou agar plates. This is considered to 
be superior to the cough method for isolat- 
lnS~rB. pertussis. 

v^Throat, Nasopharynx, and Sinus 
Drainage Cultures 

Organism^ -'normal to the throat and 
nasopharynx include: -Streptococcus virl- 
dans. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria 



Microbiolocic Metjiods

Candida albicans Actinomyces tsraelii and 
Borrelia iincentu 

In evaluatmg cultures from the throat or 
nasophar>Tix it is important to remember 
that an unusual predommance of a par 
ticular organism e\en though it may be 
considered a normal inhabitant may hate 
some significance and such a finding 
should be reported The hst of organisms 
just given IS not a complete one and a 
given situation might cause a so^alied 
normal inhabitant to exert a deleterious 
effect One cannot tell whether the pre 
dominance of one orgamsm represents a 
cause or a result of some process 

Collection and Hxammauon of Spea 
mens Throat and nasopharyngeal cultures 
are collected with cotton swabs These may 
be prepared by twisting a pledget of a 
good grade of absorbent cotton on the end 
of a wooden applicator stick One or several 
of the swabs may be placed in a test tube 
and sterilized by dry heat Cotton swabs 
can also be purchased at low cost Alginate 
swabs if available are highly recommended 
for taking cultures 

To collect the culture insert the swab 
through the mouth being careful not to 
touch the tongue cheek or other oral stir 
face The tongue may be depressed with a 
tongue depressor Any obvious lesions (ab 
scesses foUicles or plaques) in the throat 
or tonsillar surfaces or any visible crypts 
should be explored v igorously with the 
swab rotating it and getting beneath the 
surface It is not sufficient simply to pass 
the rotating swab gently d\er the surface 
If no obvious lesions are present the swab 
should be vigorously rotated over tonsillar 
and other surfaces especially any inflamed 
areas In these cases it is well to obtain 
material from the nasopharyngeal area 
which is behind and above the uvula For 
this purpose a swab made with a bent wire 
which may be inserted well up into the 
nasopharyngeal region has definite advan 
tages 

The nasopharyngeal swab has the ad 
vantage of avoiding much contamination 
with the normal flora and is particularly 
useful In cases of suspected whooping 


cough Cultures taken from the upper naso- 
pharynx have been found particularly sue 
cessful m our experience with children For 
this purpose a very thin swab on a flexible 
aluminum or copper wire (19 gauge) is 
mserted through the previously cleared 
nasal passage being careful to avoid touch 
mg the sides It is inserted until it meets 
defimte resistance and there gently rotated 
Such swabs maj yield nearly pure cultures 
of organisms in cases of bronchial pneu 
moma and meningococcal infection and 
may be very viseful m whooping cough It 
cannot be too strongly emphasized that 
care m the collection and handling of 
swabs vv^ll be most rewarding in terms of 
results 

It IS imperative that swabs not be al 
lowed to dry out before transfer to culture 
media This can be avoided by transporting 
the specimen to the laboratory immediatel) 
and inoculatmg the media by inoculating 
the media at the bedside or by placing the 
swab in a tube containing sterile infusion

It IS advisable to collect two swabs one of 
which is smeared over a marked area on a 
clean dr) slide In most cases the smear 
should be gram stained but special stains 
may be desired especially in cases of sus 
pected diphtheria or Vincents infection 
The results of examining direct smears 
should never be considered definitive but 
may be used to guide cultural procedures 
Any reports made from such an examina 
tion must be descnptive and tentative 

The streakmg of plates with swabs ma> 
be done in sev eral ways the primary goals 
bemg to obtain representative growth of 
the orgamsm and to provide isolated col 
omes for study One may rub the swab 
back and forth over one fourth to one third 
of the agar plate with continuous rotation 
This ma> be followed by streaking with the 
inoculating loop at a 90° angle to the swab 
streaks crossmg over the swabbed area 
each time and covering all the rest of the 
plate Some workers prefer to moisten 
the swab with broth before streaking on the 
plate Another method is to emulsify the 
swab with broth before streaking on the 
plate The swab can also be emulsified in 
0 25 to 0 5 ml of infusion broth by vigor 


ous agitation before streaking out three or 
four Joopfuls of the broth emulsion When 
bedside inoculation of media can be done 
the first method may be used but when 
some ume elapses between collection and 
inoculation emulsification is probably best 
to avoid drying 

The inoculated plates are incubated at 
37** C and examined after 24 hours at 
which time the colomes are studied care

per cent CO-> enhances growth of N men

must be explored with the swabs vigor 
ously enough to break the surface At least 
two and preferably three swabs should be 
taken

For morphologic descriptions of C 
diphthenae refer to the section describing 
the vanous species of micTooTganisms (p 
643) One must examine these direct 
smears carefully and interpret the findings 
wnth caution Failure to see typical C dipli 
tbenae does not rule out their presence in 
the throat Positive findmgs must be cor 
related with clinical findings smee there 
are nontoxic C diphthenae that are mor 
phologically and culturally typical This 
does not negate the value of the direct 
smear but does imply caution 
^'Three media should be inoculated in 
cases of suspected diphtheria -^oefllers 
serum of Pai s slant a tellurite agar plate 
and a blood agar plate There are several 
suitable tellurite media among them Muel 
lers tcUunte medium Tinsdales medium 
and chocolate blood tellurite medium If 
two swabs are available one should be 
streaked over the entire Loefflers slant and 
on the surface of the tellurite agar The 
other swab should be streaked on the blood 
agar plate All media should be incubated 
at 37° C 

Growth on the Loefflers slant should be 
checked after 12 to 18 hours of Incubation 
More than 24 hours of incubation is not 


recommended smee overgrowth of other 
organisms may obscure the C diphtheriae 
Smears are made from the growth on the 
slant and stained with Albert s or Loefller s 
alkaline methylene blue stain These stained 
smears are examined for the presence of 
morphologically typical C diphthenae 

ThC'blood agar plate is examined after 
24 hours for typical small beta hemolytic 
colonies of Streptococcus pyogenes The 
presence of numerous such colonies is sug 
gestive of folhcular tonsillitis but one must 
still rule out C diphthenae because the two 
organisms may occur together in cases of 
diphtheria 

The 'tellurite plate is incubated for 48 
hours and examined for the typical black 
or gray colonies of C diphthenae Since 
certain other orgamsms e g staphylococci 
yeasts and diphtheroids may produce 
black colomes on this medium it is neces 
sary to do gram stains to determine the 
type of organism present It is well to be 
famihar with the differences between the 
microscopic appearance of C diphthenae 
on tellurite medium and a specimen yield 
mg morphologically typical bacilli after 
growth on the Loefflers slant Another 
tellunte plate should be streaked from the 
grotvth on the Loefflers medium Likewise 
failure to see typical orgamsms from 
Loefflers when suggestive colomes are 
found on the tellurite plate should be fol 
lowed by inocvlation of a loefflers slant 
horn the colony on the tellurite medium 

As mdicaied before there are morpho 
logically and culturally typical C dtph 
theriae that are not toxigenic that is do 
not produce toxin and are consequently 
nonpathogenic Perhaps the simplest way 
to determine this is to grow a pure culture 
of the isolated organism on a Loefflers 
slant for 24 to 48 hours and wash off the 
growth in 3 to 4 ml of infusion broth Add 
the broth to the slant and rotate vigorously 
between the hands Inoculate 0 5 ml of 
the suspended culture mtrapentoneally into 
each of two guinea pigs one of which has 
been protected by giving mtrapentoneally 
500 to 1000 units of diphtheria antitoxin a 
few hours previously The unprotected 
guinea pig should die within four or five 
days and the protected one should show 
no ili effects The protected guinea pig 
should always be included to show that no 
toxic organisms other than C diphthenae 
are present The toxicity test is not so im 
portant in clinically typical cases but is 
very important in following convalescents 
and In detecting carriers or doubtful cases

Klebsiella pneumoniae and Psewdomonas

any other microorganism ma) be found in 
the spinal fluid (For fungi and Mruses see 
Chapters 18 and 19 ) 

Some of these organisms occur much 
more frequently in meningitis than others 
and some ha\e a definite age distribution 
WemophilMS influenzae occurs most fre 
quentl> in joung children and seldom in 
adults N mcntngtdtus occurs frequently 
in children but also affects older age groups 
and may occur in epidemic form Other 
organisms are sometimes found in spinal 
fluid Occasional!) as a result of injuries 
bacteria of the normal flora may gain entry 
Thus an) finding must be checked (hor 
oughi) before a final decision is made 
about its etiologic significance 

When cerebrospinal fluid is collected for 
bactenologic examination it must be irans 
ported to the laboratory immediatcJj and 
examined at once This is particularly im 
portant in meningococcal Infection since 
this organism tends to autoljze rapidl) and 
thus maj be missed Speed is only slightly 
less important in other forms of memn 
gitis since the earlv initiation of appropri 
ate treatment Is of the greatest urgency 

In the bactenologic examination of ccrc 
brospinal fluid the gram stained smear is 
extremely important The specimen should 
be ceninfuged at 2000 r p m for ten min

sediment is used for smear and culture A

since one quite frequently finds strands of 
proteinaceous material in such preparations

It Is also important to note the rehthe 
number and types of cells present on the 
smear In general polymorphonuclear leu 
kocytes ire indicative of bacterial infection 
but a predominance of lymphocytes points 
to viral involvement The findings of this 
direct examination should be reported Im

-For culture the media of choice arc blood 
and chocolate agar and it is well to in 
oculatc each specimen on plates of both 
media if possible N meningiiidis and H

These plates should be incubated under 10 
per cent CO It is also desirable to in 
oculatc a tube of fluid thioglycoUatc me

be poured into the original tube containing

734 Clinical Diagnosis by 

The diagnosis of gonorrhea in the female 
presents certain problems The disease may 
✓be asymptomatic or it may manifest itsetf 
only by an mcreased vaginal discharge 
Swab specimens for smear and culture may 
be taken from the cervix vagina or 
urethra as determined by the examinmg 
physician Oumg to the complex bacteri^d 
flora and the presence of epithelial cells 
the exammation of gram stained smears 
from such material is difficult and failure 
to find typical mtra and extracellular gram 
negative diplococci cannot be considered 
final This is especially true of chronic 
longstanding infections Thus in the fe- 
male culture is a necessary adjunct m 
attempting to make a diagnosis Swabs 
should be streaked over the surface of a 
V chocolate or GC agar plate and the plate 
incubated m the CO jar The addition of 
a few drops of a 250 units per ml solution 
of polymyxin B to half the agar plate be 
fore inoculating it with the swab is of 
considerable help m suppressing over 
growth by cohform organisms (Crookes 
and Stuart 1959) 

It IS possible to culture unne sediments 
from either the male or the female The 
unne should be the first morning specimen 
and should be sedimented and the sediment 
cultured immediately 

If condiuons other than gonorrhea are 
suspected the cultural methods will depend 
on the clinical impression Puerperal fever 
m the female is caused usually by aerobic 
or anaerobic streptococci or srapbjJococci 
Inoculation of swabs on blood agar or fluid 
thioglycoUate and the use of anaerobic 
methods should reveal these organisms An 
orgamsm recently shown bv Gardner and 
Dukes (1955) Brewer Halpem and 
Thomas (1957) and others to be a cause of 
leukorrhea vaginius and cervicitis is 
known as HemophtUis vagmitn This is a 
a small pleomorphic gram negauve bacil 
lus On wet moimts of the discharge epi 
tfcehal cells may be seen covered with such 
large masses of this organism as to ob 
hterate the cell membrane — the so-called 
-clue cell ' Cbaractensticall) there is an al 
most complete absence of leukocvtes in the 
preparation Cultures on rabbit blood agar

staining In exposed chancres material 
for examination is collected b> first 
cleansing the surface and then grasping 
the lesion between thumb and forefinger 
and expressing the clear amber fluid by 
pressure The operator should aliva^s wear 
rubber gloves and dispose of contaminated 
material m disinfectant solution The ex 
pressed fluid maj then be touched with a 
clean covershp and the shp applied to a 
clean new microscope shde Alternatively 
the fluid may be collected with a capillary 
pipet The covershp is sealed around the 
edge with petrolatum and the preparation 
promptlj examined by darkfield microscopy 
Considerable care and experience are re- 
quired m making this exammation Some 
umes nonpathogemc spirochetes are pres 
ent These are usually much less delicate 
than T pnlltdum (See section on specific 
orgamsms p 65] ) 

For cervical vaginal or other unexposed 
lesions n is necessary to visualize the lesion 
with a speculum or other instrument and to 
collect exudate with a Pasteur pipct or 
inoculating loop This is placed on a shde 
and covered with a covershp as just de 
senbed No methods are available for cul 
turing T pnllidum 

Another condition occurring m the same 
region is soft chancre (chancroid) which 
IS caused bj Hemophilus ducreyi Gram 
stained smears from the lesion may reveil 
small gram negative bacilli arranged in 
rows Culture from the lesion may be made 
on enriched media or clotted rabbit blood 
but IS frequently unsuccessful 

A rare condition granuloma ingumale 
IS a granulomatous lesion usually involving 
an inguinal lymph node Stained aspirates 
from these lesions reveal gram negative 
bacilli with large capsules (Donovan 
bodies) The causative agent (Calym 
matobacterium granulomatis) is verv diffi

Bicteni on the skin may be either “tran

constantly present and consist primarily of 
gram positive cocci (Evans et al 1950) 

IVlien lesions occur in or upon the sUn 
and microbiologic examination is desired 
certain basic principles should be observed 
Material for smears and culture should be 
taken from an area as close to normal tis 
sue as possible that is the edge or base 
of an ulcer or boil after removal of pus or 
debris In certain instances it is not profit 
able to culture pus or necrotic material Pus 
may be completely sterile even though the 
lesion from which it is derived may be 
caused bj a specific bacterium On the 
other hand it may be heavily contaminated 
with saprophytic bacteria and the culture 
ma> >ield nothing but confusion One 
should culture for anaerobic bacteria (C/ 
tetam Cl perfnngens and anaerobic strep 
tococci) especially in deep or penetrating 
wounds 

In certain conditions in which skin 
rashes occur the causative organism may 
sometimes be demonstrated m the lesions 
of the iTish In mcningococcemia inasion 
of the bright red petechiae followed by a 
gram stained smear and culture on choco 
late agar may reveal the typical gram neg 
ativc diplococci Certain of the viral dis 
eases (smallpox and herpes) that produce 
skm lesions can be examined by stained 
smear and inoculation into embryomlcd 
eggs or animals (See Chapter 19) 

The fnosf common cause of borfs fu 
runcles and carbuncles is Staphylococcus 
aureus although other organisms such as 
Streptococcus pyogenes and certain anaer 
obic organisms may rarely be Involved 
Cultures from such lesions should be taken 
with care to avoid contamination with or 
gamsms from the skin surface The area 
around and over the lesion should be thor 
oughly cleansed with 70 per cent alcohol 
and allowed to dry Pus or other material 
in the lesion should be removed and a 
stcnle swab used to explore the base of the 
lesion More than one swab may be used 
depending on the number of procedures to 
be done The swab should be emulsified 
m a small amount of infusion broth The 
broth suspension should be streaked on a 
blood ngar plate and inoculated into a tube 
of fluid tluoglj collate medium for detcc 
tion of anaerobes Also ^^ben possible one 


should streak a second blood agar plate 
and incubate in the anaerobic jar A swab 
should be smeared on i slide and stained 
with gram stain Such a stained smear may 
suggest the type of organism involved 

If the organism cultured proves to be 
Staphylococcus attrcits it is important to 
do tests for antibiotic susceptibility and to 
test for coaguHse and deox>'nbonucIeasc 
activity 

In superficial infections such as im 
petigo or acne the surface area should be 
cleansed thoroughly before cultures are 
taken The surface of lesions should then 
be broken and material collected on swabs 
as in boils and furuncles Staphylococci 
streptococci (aerobic and anaerobic) 
Corynebactenum acnes and certain anaer 
obic bacteria may be present m such 
conditions It is not always easy or possible 
to assess the role of the isolated organisms 
In these conditions especially m acne In 
impetigo the causative agent is usually 
either Streptocoeem pyogenes or Staphylo 
coccus flureus 

Blood agar is the medium of choice as 
well as fluid thJoglycollaie medium for 
isolation of anaerobes It may be desirable 
to inoculate two blood agar plates and to

in large measure by the existing situation 
The site and method of taking material for 
culture are determined by the nature of 
the wound and whether evidence of obvious 
infection exists Numerous organisms may 
be involved depending on the amount of 
dirt and debns that may have been intro- 
duced Wounds involving considerable 
trauma or penetrating wounds may contain 
anaerobes such as Cl tetani or Cl pir 
fringens Thus it is essential to do both 
aerobic and anaerobic cultures

Blood culture ;s one of the movt im 
ponant and cntJcal procedures in clinical 
microbiology When done properly It can 
be of greatest assistance in diagnosis but 
when poorly done it can introduce con 
fusion and misunderstanding One of the 
best Indications for blood culture is the 
presence of fever especially if it is per 
sistent 

The time at which the blood culture is 
taken is important It should always be 
taken before initiation of antibiotic therapy 
and jf possible should be taken when thu 
fever is rising Once antibiotic therapy Is 
started the chances of obtaining a positive 
culture are greailv reduced if not com 
plcicly nullified The stage of the disease 
may he important For example In lyTihoJd 
fever the blood culture is most likely to be 
positive during the first two weeks of the 
disease In some conditions such ns sub 
acute bacterial cndocardlils repeated blood 
cultures should be done This is also indJ 
cated in hruccllosls In which at best the 
organism is difficult to culture

the patient should be placed in a comfort- 
able position with the vein accessible. As 
a rule one of the veins in the antecubitai 
fossa is used for puncture in adults. In 
small children and babies blood may be 
collected from the jugular vein. This must 
be done by one experienced in such tech- 
niques. The skin over and surrounding the 
area of puncture should be cleansed thor- 
oughly with alcohol or soap to remove all 
oily deposits and then painted with disin- 
fectant. Tincture of iodine (3 per cent 
iodine in 70 per cent ethyl alcohol) is rec- 
ommended. The iodine should be left on 
for a few minutes and the area allowed to 
dry before the puncture is made. The area 
should be wiped off vnth alcohol after the 
blood has been collected. A tourniquet is 
apphed to the arm and tightened to sup- 
press venous, but not arterial, flow of blood. 

The materials for collection must be dry, 
e.g., sterilized wth dry heat. There are a 
number of techniques for collection of 
blood that can be used, depending on the 
situation. The technique involving the least 
number of steps in collection and inocula- 
tion of appropriate media is the most de- 
sirable, since each step increases the pos- 
sibility of contamination. One can obtain 
'blood culture sets''commercially at mod- 
erate cost. Each set consists of a rubber 
cap vacuum bottle containing suitable me- 
dium and a' sterile rubber tube with a 
needle at both ends. One needle Is inserted 
into the vein and the other through the 
rubber cap Into the bottle. The vacuum 
draws the blood Into the bottle. When the 
proper amount of blood has entered, the 
rubber tube is pinched off, the tourniquet 
is removed, and the needle is removed from 
the vein. If the bottle contains 50_jnl. of 
medjum, one should collect no more' than 
5___ml. of blood. If one wishes to do an 
aerobic culture, a piece of sterile cotton is 
placed over the needle, and air is allowed 
to flow into the bottle. If anaerobic culture 
is to be done, the needle is removed from 
the bottle while the rubber tube remains 
pinched shut. Most such bottles con^in 
increased COj. 

If the blood is collected with a needle 
and syringe, one should collect 5 to 10 nil., 
release the tourniquet, and remove the 
needle. A pledget of cotton should be ap- 
plied to the site of the puncture and pres- 
sure applied for several minutes with the 
arm elevated. Immediately after collection 
the blood should be transferred directly 
into media or into a sterile flask or lest 


tube containing 4 ml. of 2 per cent sodium 
citrat e to prevent clotting. It is recom- 
mended that one use a bottle containing 
50 ml. of blood culture medium and fitted 
with a screw cap and rubber diaphragm. 
The needle is Inserted through the cap, and 
not more than 5 ml, of blood is introduced 
into the medium with gentle shaking. Once 
the medium is inoculated, it should be 
incubated as soon as possible. 

If the blood is citrated, the tube or flask 
should be shaken gently and transported 
immediately to the laboratory for inocula- 
tion of media. Delays should be avoided, 
since antibody may adversely affect the 
organisms and citrate itself may be detri- 
mental. 

By using the blood culture sets already 
mentioned, one can do "aerobic or anaerobic^ 
culture or both as desired. If the bottles 
and flasks are made in the laboratory, it is 
well touse a good aerobic broth as well as 
fluid-tmoglycoUate medium fw anaerobic 
culture. Both media can be obtained readily 
in dehydrated form. In most chronic or 
subacute conditions it is well to inoculate 
both types of media, since anaerobic or 
microaerophilic streptococci, Bocferoitlcs, 
and certain similar organisms will not 
grow out aerobically.. 

•ylxi a number of conditions, such as sub- 
acute bacterial endocarditis and brucello- 
sis. in which the number of organisms may 
be low, it may be desirable to culture more 
than 5 ml. of blood. In such instances It is 
better to inoculate several 50 ml. portions 
of media than to increase the amount of 
blood in each bottle. If one uses excessive 
Wood, the naturai inhibitory substances or 
antibodies present may prevent growth of 
bacteria that may be in the blood. 

Some ivorfcers prefer to use a Castaneda 
bottle for blood culture. This is made by 
placing a layer of an agar medium (blood 
agar or infusion agar) on one side of a 
square or rectangular bottle, then adding 
aseptically 50 ml. of blood culture broth. 
After the blood is added, the bottle is tilted 
to bathe the agar, and colonies may then 
appear on this surface. 

^It is desirable to add 0.05 per cent para- 
aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to the blood 
culture medium to counteract sulfonamide 
drugs that may be in the blood of patients. 
Appropriate amounts of penicillinase may 
be added routinely or only in cases in which 
the patient has been treated with penicil- 
lin. 

The conditions of incubation are Im-

of the other organisms 

After inoculation the cultures should be 
shaken to distribute the blood throughout 
the medium before incubation at 37* C 
Daily examinations should be made Evi 
dence of bacterial growth may appear as

of growth ^pears samples should be re 
moved for f^ratn stain and iubculturc With 
no visible evidence of growth samples for 
gram stain and subculture should be taken 
at 24 to 48 hour intervals for seven to ten 
days and vvcekly thereafter 

To take a sample from the blood culture 
bottle one should use a dry sterile needle 
and syringe The culture is shaken and 
great care used to sterilize the top before 
insertion of the needle Routinely a drop 
should be smeared on a slide for gram stain 
and one or two drops streaked on a*'blood

other media may be inoculated For c\

tivc bacilli suggests a ^almouiUa infection 
and One should streak an EMD plate or

The results of the gram stain the type 
of growth in the blood culture and the 
clinical appearance of the patient will do 
much to determine the procedures for iden

The microbiologlc examination of feces 
Involves several procedures bactcriologic 
examination involving culture of specific

structures of intestinal helminths examina 
tion for viruses and cytologic descriptions 
of the feces in terms of cellular elements 
undigested food particles fatty acid crys 
tals and yeasts The presence of yeasts Is 
not necessarily diagnostic in the ordinary 
sense but may be viewed as a rcflcc 
tion of conditions in the intestinal tract 
Such examination often gives valuable 
leads about what cultural or other pro- 
cedures might prove of value For example 
the presence of large numbers of pus cells 
might indicate a bacierJal infectious proc 
ess and the presence of much undigested 
protein or fatly acid crystals may indicate 
faulty absorption 

In this section the methods for bactcrio- 
logic and parasitologic examination of fcccs 
w1H be described For viral isolation see 
Chapter ID and for morphologic descrljv 
tlons see Chapter J6 

The decision to describe bactcriologic 
and parasitologic methods in the same see 
tton stems from the rccognJfJon that quite 
frequently both types of examination arc 
indicated in a gJvin patient and that idcalh 
a laboratory should be capable of doing 
both simultaneously Actually the cytologic 
cxarnlmtlon may be done by the person 
examining for parasites since one may 
belter recognize cysts and ova if he is 
familiar with the other structures that may 
be present in feces Viral studies require 
quite different management 

The loner portion of the intestinal tract 
represents a complex biologic system in 
which numerous species of microorganisms 
may normally be found The flora may con

that enterotoxin producing strains of 
S(( 2 p%{ococct<s aureus are present fre- 
quently if not always Under speaal cir 
cumstances these organisms may produce 
severe disease Proteus mor(;anu has been 
suspected of contributing to dianhea m 
children Certain gram positive organisms, 
such as staphylococci and possibly strepto 
COCCI have been suspected of playing a 
role in ulcerative colitis These relation 
ships are dlfllcult to evaluate and the whole 
subject of enteric disease needs much fur 
ther study 

Occasionally patients who are given 
prophylactic antibiotics prior to surgery de 
velop large numbers of staphylococci in the 
Intestinal tract, apparently replacing to a 
large extent the normal intestinal flora 
Such patients may go into shock unless 
promptly treated This condition Is known 
as pseudomembranous enterocolitis Gram 
stain of the stools reveals large numbers of 
gram positive cocci, and cultures on azide 
blood agar or Staphylococcus Medium 110 
reveal almost pure cultures of Staphylococ- 
cus Other organisms may also cause this 
condition (cJostndia and fecal streptococci 
for example) 

Certain serotypes of Eschenchia colt 
Can cause serious and sometimes fatal 
diarrhea in Infants and children Numerous 
outbreaks of diarrhea in nurseries have 
been caused by these E coli Interestingly 
enough, recent work has shown that house 
hold pets may serve as reservoirs of infec 
Qon with these organisms (Mian, 1959) 
(See Chapter 16 ) 

Certain members of the normal flora of 


the intestine are capable of producing dis 
ease outside the digestive tract E coh, 
Klebsiella, Profews, and Pseiidomonns aeru- 
ginosa are common causes of urinary tract 
infection These organisms are not Infre

The most common entenc bactenal 
pathogens are as follows Salmonella typhi 
and other salmonellas. Shigella (several 
species), Paracolobactrum (paracolon, 
pathogemcity vanes), enteropathogenic E 
coll, Vibrio comma, and Staphylococcus 
aureus 

The pathogenic protozoa are Entamoeba 
histolytica, Dientamoeba fragilis, and 
Giardm lamblia 

The pathogenic helminths of which the 
ova or other structures may be found in 
feces are as follows Necator amencanus, 
Ancylostoma duodenale, Strongyloides ster- 
corahs. Trichans tncliiiira, Ascans Inm 
bncoidcs, Enterobius vermiculans, Dtphyl 
lobothnum latum, Taema saglimta. Taenia

Schistosoma mansoni, haematobium, and 
joponiciim. Fasciola hepattca, Fasciolopsts

Collection of Specimens from the 
Intestinal Tract 

A specimen of feces for examination 
should ideally be the first of the mormng 
When they^can be examined immediately, 
the specimens can be collected in waxed 
paper cartons vvith tight fitting tops Col 
lection may be made in bed pans and trans 
ferred to cartons, but if this is done care 
should be exercised to avoid mixing with 
unne With infants one may collect the 
feces from a diaper In any case the speci 
men should be in the laboratory and ready 
for examination within 30 to 60 minutes 
after collection The use of banum or 
mineral oil should be avoided in patients 
whose stools are to be collected for micro 
biologic examination The presence of these 
substances renders stool examination very 
difiicuU Some workers prefer saline 
purged stools for parasitologic examination 
and this can be quite useful However, if 
It is possible to examine a sufficient number 
of normally passed stools, purgation may 
be unnecessary 

Fresh, unpreserved specimens are prefer- 
able, but It IS not always possible to obtain 
them If it IS not possible to obtain fresh 
specimens, one can use certain preserva- 
tives For bacterial culture one may emul

The number of stool examinations neces 
sary to diagnose or to rule out a given 
infection has been the subject of much 
study It is difficult to establish a number 
in any given situation, and one should per 
haps never set a maximum The number 
of exammations depends on several or 
cumstances In general though, for both 
bactenal and parasitologic examinations one 
should examine at least three specimens 
collected on successive or alternate days 
For the viruses that may occur in feces 
see Chapter 19 

Bacteriologic Examination of Feces 
Since the feces normally contain a con 
slderable number of different bactenal 
species the isolation of any single speacs 
or group requires special techniques 'The 
principles of fecal culture depend on the 
use of media designed either for enhance- 
ment or selection of parucular orgamsms 
Most of the well recognized bacterial dis 
eases of man (typhoid and enteric fever, 
bacillary dysentery, Salmonella food poison 
mg and Asiatic cholera) are caused bj 
gram negative entenc bactena of the 
genera Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibno 
Sometimes other gram negative eptenc 
bacilli, such as Proteus vwrganii, entero- 
palhogemc Eschenchia coh, Alcaligenes 
fecalis, and certain paracolons, may be in 
volved The isolation of this group of or 
ganisms depends on the use of media con 
taming certain substances that Inhibit the 
growth of gram posiuve organisms They 
also contain lactose to assist in separating 
the coh aerogenes bactena from the organ 
isms that do not produce acid from this 
carbohydrate On such media the lactose 
fermenting bactena produce colored col 
omes, although the colonies of nonlactose 
fermenters are colorless 

The numbers of any given pathogenic 
bactenum in the feces vary considerably 
depending on the severity and type of in 
fecUon and the stage of the disease For 
example, in typhoid fever the number of 
S tijphi may be very small in the early 
stages but tends to increase greatly after 
the second week of the disease In severe

cases one ma^ find a nearly pure culture of 
this organism in the stools This may also 
occur with V comma in cholera in the 
carrier state the number of the organisms 
usually IS quite small 

The enhancement media, selenite F and 
tetrathionate broth, are designed to assist 
m the isolation of Salmonella in cases in 
which few organisms are present In these 
media Salmonci/a muluphes more rapidlj 
than the other organisms dunng the first 
12 to 18 hours of incubation at 37® C 
Thus if one inoculates from the fecal speci 
men into one of these media, incubates 
for from 12 to 18 hours and then streaks 
from this onto the selectue media, the 
chances of isolating these pathogens ate 
increased 

Selcctii c media for entenc bacterial 
pathogens can be divided into tuo groups 
those that are highly selectne and those 
that are moderately seleciuc The latter 
might better be termed differential Tlie 
most commonl) used lughlj selective media 
are salmonella shigella (SS) agar, hnlliant 
green agar. Wilson Blair bismuth sulfite 
agar and desoNycholate-citrate agar The 
most commonly used less selective or differ* 
ential media are eosin methylene blue 
(EMB) agar, Endo agar, and MacConkeys 
agar It is not recommended that one use 
all these media, but it is well to choose one 
from each group A good combination is 
SS and EMB, altfiough others may serve 
equallj well, depending on experience and 
need 

The routine procedure for fecal culture 
in the laboratory is as follows Pick, por- 
tions of the stool containing mucus or 
blood for inoculation of media If the stool 
is liquid It Can be streaked directly on EMB 
and SS agar plates Appropriate portions, 
particularly any blood or mucus, of formed 
OL semiformed stools should be used to 
make a heavj suspension in infusion broth 
The SS agar should be streaked heavily, 
using several loopfuls of the material, but 
the EMB plate should be streaked with two 
to three loopfuls At the same time a por- 
tion the size of a pea should be inoculated 
into a tube of selenite F or tetrathionate 
ennehment broth and thoroughly emulsi 
fied The enrichment culture should be 
incubated 12 to 18 hours at 37° C and 
then streaked on a SS agar plate The EMB 
and SS agar plates should be examined 
after 24 and 48 hours and suspicious col- 
onies picked for further study If suspicious 
nonlactose fermenting colomes are seen, 
this should be reported to the ph>sician.

It should be emphasized that, in enteric 
infection in which fever exists, blood cul 
ture may be of great help The siniultane 
ous isolation of an o-gamsra from blood 
culture and fecal culture is si gnifi cant 
Unne culture is also desirable, espeaally 
in fjphoid fever 

It IS frequently desirable to culture feces 
for Sfaphylococcas or Streptococctis Here

A number of protozoa occur in the in

without producing disease, some of the hel 
minths are only mildly pathogenic Hecog 
niuon of the nonpathogemc protozoa is 
important for two reasons First, they must

species (Entamoeba histolytica, Dlenta- 
moeba fragilis, Ctardia lambha) and, sec 
ond, the finding of nonpathogenic protozoa 
should encourage further search for patho- 
gens, since the mode of infection is essen 
(tally the same for pathogens and non 
pathogens 

The parasitic protozoa exist with some 
exceptions In three stages m the intestinal 
tract the trophozoite or vegetative stage, 
the rounded precyst, and the cyst Some of 
the protozoa exist only as trophozoites For 
descriptions of the morphology of the vari 
ous protozoan forms see Chapter 16 

The hfe cycle of the helminths is much 
more complex than that of the protozoa, 
and usually only one stage is found in the 
stool Most commonly tins is the ovum, 
although other structures (larvae and prog 
lottids, for example) are found in some 
cases and when found are diagnostic These 
structures are described in Chapter 16 

The aims of parasitologic exammation of 
stools are to find and identify any pro 
tozoa or helminths present in the stool, to 
carry out a sufficient number of procedures 
with sufficient care to be reasonably sure 
that none of these orgamsms has been

missed and to recognize and describe the 
cytologic and other elements in the stool 
in order to assist in establishing the proc 
esses that may be going on in the digestive 
tract It IS important that the examiner be 
able to recognize pus cells macrophages 
yeasts undigested food particles fatty acid 
crystals and Charcot Leyden crystals in 
order to di/Tercntlate between these and 
the protozoan cysts 

It has been shown repeatedly that there 
is a direct relationship bctuccn the num 
ber of procedures done on a stool specimen 
and the percentage of positive findings of 
protozoa and helminths This is particularly 
true in the case of the important pathogen 
Emamoeba histolt/ticn (Fig 17-17) (Sa 
Witz and Faust 1942) Routinely it is de 
sirable to do at least four procedures on 
each fecai specimen Direct smear in 
saline direct smear with iodine stain direct 
smear stained with iron hematoxylin or 
other permanent stain and concentration 
of feces by ffltcfifes formafin-erfter methotf 
or by zinc sulfate flotation stained with 
iodine The same holds for the study of 
preserved feces 

The direct smear in saline is done to 
demonstrate trophozoites of protozoa and 
since one of the diagnostic characteristics 
of these forms is motility this should be 
do«c immediately and provision should be 
made to use a warmed (37® C ) slide and 
saline This is important since the motility 
is lost on cooling If the stool cannot be 
examined immediately it should be held in 
the refrigerator and warmed In the 37® C 
incubator before examination To make the 
preparation two or three drops of the saline 
are pheed on a slide and a small portion 
of the fecal simple is emulsified in it For 
lions containing mucus or blood arc most 
desirable Care should be exercised to avoid 
making this preparation too thick Fxpen

siutable iodine preparation on a slide and 
emulsify the fecal matter as m the saline 
preparation Both preparations may be 
made on the same shde The examination is 
identical in each case 

Certain of the protozoa cannot be dis 
tmguished readily from one another by 
direct smear exammatlon This is paiticu 
larly true with the small races of En 
tavioeba histolytica and Eiidohmax nana 
Therefore adequately prepared and per 
manently stained smears are made and ex 
aimned (Fig 17-18) For this it has been 
a common practice to use Delahelds iron 
hematoxylin stain or one of its modifica 
tions (Felsenfeld and Young 1945) An 
other useful stain that is somewhat easier 
to do is a modification of Mallory s phos 
photungstic acid technique (see Appendix 
p 933) It is important that the laboratory 
staff be famihar with one or the other of 
these stains and use it routinely 

Quite frequently the number of cysts or 
osa m the stool is small and they may not 
be seen on direct smear It is therefore 
necessary to use a suitable concentration 
method There are seteral such techmques 
two of which (Ritchies formalm'eihcr 
technique and the zinc sulfate flotation) 
are widely used One or the other of these 
IS an essential part of the fecal examma 
tion 

Ritchie Formalin Ether Concentration 
Method 

1 Emulsify a portion of stool about the 
size of a walnut in 10 ml of saline 

2 Strain the emulsion through damp 
ened gauze mto a test tube 

3 Centrifuge at 1500 lo 2000 rpm for 
two minutes Decant the supernatant 

4 Resuspend the sediment in fresh 
saline centnfuge and decant as before 

5 Add approximately 10 ml of 10 per 
cent formalin to the sediment mix thor 
oughly and allow to stand for fi\e mm 
utes 

6 Add 3 ml of ether stopper the tube 
and shake tigorously 

7 Centnfuge at 1500 rpm for about 
tno minutes This should result in four 
layors a small amount of sediment con 
taming most of the parasites and o\a a 
layer of fonnalin a plug of fecal debris on

stick and carefully decant the top three 
layers 

9 Examine the sediment after mixing 
with two or three drops of iodine solution 
and applying a co\erslip One may also 
ivish to use a saline preparation 
Zinc Sulfate Flotation This method de 
pends on the differences in sp-^cific gravity 
between cysts and ova and fecal debris If 
a zme sulfate solution with a specific grav 
ity of 1 16 or 1 18 is used the cysts and 
ova float while most of the fecal debns 
sinks to the bottom Trophozoites of the 
protozoa are destroyed and some of the 
more fragile cysts may be damaged al 
though this is not usually serious The 
method is not satisfactory for operculated 
helminth ova 

Zi«c sulfate soltiiton Dissolve 400 gm 
of ZnSO^ (U S P Crystalline) m 1000 ml 
of water Check the specific gravity with 
1 hydrometer and add water until the spe 
cific gravity of 1 18 is obtained 

Procedure 

1 Emulsify a pea size piece of feces 
in distilled water in a 13 x 100 mm test 
tube 

2 Filter the suspension through one 
layer of wet cheesecloth to remove large 
particles 

3 Centnfuge for approximately two 
minutes at 1800 rpm and pour off the 
supernatant by inv erting the test tube 
quickly 

4 Add approximately 2 ml of tap 
water Break up the sediment and fill the 
tube "ath water Centnfuge and repeat 
these washings until the supernatant fluid 
is fairly clear 

5 Add a small amount of the zinc 
sulfate soluuon and break up the sediment 
Fill the lobe with the zinc sulfate solution 
and centnfuge Al this point the cysts and 
ova should be floating on the meniscus 

6 With a wire loop (5 to 6 mm in 
diameter) carefully remove a few loopfuls 
from the meniscus and place on a slide 

7 Add one or two drops of D Antonis 
iodine stain and mix by gently rotating the 
slide 

8 Add a coverslip and examme for 
cysts and ova 

The diligence ivith which these examma 
uons are done and the training and ex 
penence of the examiner determine in large 
measure the number of positive findings 
reported Reports on stool examinations 
should incorporate all findings including a

scopic c>tology, and of course an> pro- 
tozoan or helminthic forms seen There are 
times when structures that are unidentifi 
able resemble protozoa These should be 
reported so that the physician can decide 
whether or not to submit more specimens 
One cannot put an upper limit to the 
number of specimens to be examined when 
a high degree of suspicion exists 

Some workers ha\e reported success in 
the diagnosis of infection with Entamoeba 
histolytica by examination of proctoscopic 
aspirates These aspirates are collected 
through the proctoscope uith a serologic 
pipet or an appropriately prepared glass 
tube and rubber bulb The mouth of the 
pipct is placed o\er a lesion (pinpoint ul 
cer) and mucus is sucked into the pipet 
This material is then placed on a slide 
and examined for trophozoites Later it 
may be stained wth iodine for cysts Per 
manent stains may be made by smearing 
the aspirate on a slide previously moistened 
wth PVA fixative 

ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILm' 
TESTS 

Chemotherapy, I e the destruction of 
microorganisms by drugs was initiated by 
the pioneer studies of Ehrlich which cul 
minated in the development of salvarsan 
for the treatment of syphilis The sulfona 
mJdcs were introduced In 1935 with 
Domagk’s work on the use of Prontosil the 
active principle of which is sulfanilamide 
in the treatment of streptococcus infections 
in mice Since that time dozens of nen 
sulfonamides have been synthesized with 
ever increasing antibacterial activity and 
decreased toxicity 

The term “antibiotics" refers to sub- 
stances elaborated by living microorgan 
isms that have the capacity to inhibit the 
growth of other microorganisms The story 
of the discovery of penicillin by Fleming in 
1929 its application to the treatment of 
human disease and the subsequent do 
vclopment of a host of new antibiotics is 
well known Actually there Is no cleircut 
difTcrcniiation lietwcen the terms “antlbl 
otic" and “chemotherapeutic agent " be 
cause some of the antibiotics originally 
Isolated from natural sources have also 
been prepared synthetically (A notable 
example of this is chloramphenicol ) Con 
sequcntlj the terms arc used intcrcbanj^ 
ably 


Lahoratorv Methods 

The sulfonamides are primarily bacteri 
ostatic substances Tliey are supposed to 
inhibit growth by compeung with the ml 
croorganism for a special enzyaru system 
associated with the essential metabolite 
para aminobcnzoic acid (Wood Fildes) 
The mode of action of penicillin and other 
antibiotics in cellular metabolism is essen 
daily unknown but probably depends bas 
ically upon interference with specific steps 
of enzymatic processes in susceptible or 
ganisms In contrast to the sulfonamides 
the action of some of the antibiotics such 
as penicillin is primarily bactericidal 

The tendency of many bacteria to be 
come resjstam to aniibiotics has become a 
problem of ever increasing importance 
particularly with staphylococci and tubercle 
bacilli For example, it has been found that 
as high as 90 per cent of scrams of co- 
agulase positive staphylococci in hospital 
populations are now resistant to penicillin 
These resistant strains have caused an 
alarming number of serious infections in 
and outside hospitals This emphasizes (hat 
improper use of antibiotics can lead to sen 
ous consequences and. hence the impor 
tance of selecting the correct antibiotic 
with the aid of susceptibility tests 

The exact mechanism of the development 
of increased bacterial resistance is not 
clear It is known that all bacterial popu 
lations arc heterogeneous In their susetp 
tibillty to a given antibiotic Tlic resistant 
baclcna in a population may arise spon 
tancously as a result of mutation (Dcmtrcc 
1948) or perhaps by adaptation In some 
Instances resistance to an antibiotic is a 
function of the prtiductlon of a specific 
enzyme that destroys the drug e g , peni 
clUinasc production by staphylococci It is 
also possible that an organism actually can 
become dependent upon an antibiotic 

Many infections respond promptly to the 
empinc administration of one or another 
of the commonly used antibiotics and bac 
tcriologic cultures are unnecessary liow 
ever, when the diagnosis is uncertain in 
cases that relapse when the patients do 
not respond quickly to therapy, and when 
the disease is severe and fulminating lab- 
oratory assistance is essential and may be 
lifesaving The decisive factor Involved in 
the choice of the proper antibiotic is the 
relative susceptibility of the invading bac- 
terium As used here, the terms "scnsltiv 
ity" and “susceptibility" are synonymous 
The term "antibiotic susceptibility" is pref 
erablc to "sensitivity," since the latter term

The most wideh used methods at the 
present time are 

Test TuIkt Dilution Methods Tubes of a 
nutrient lehiclc containing serial dilutions 
of the antibiotic are inoculated with sus 
pensions of the test organism A measure 
of the snscepubilUi to the drug Is manifest 
b> failure of the organism to grow In a 
ghen dilution 

Diffusion Methods Paper discs or strips 
impregnated «ith knoum amounts of anti 
bioucs are placed on the surface of Petri 
dishes seeded with the lest organisms Sus 
ccptibiht) Is indicated by a 2 onc of in 
hlbited growth around the paper containing 
the drug 

Streak Plate Methods Agar plates con 
taming knoivn amounts of antibiotics arc 
streaked with the test organism and m 
hJbiiion of growth is noted 

Other Procedures Susceptibility can also 
be shoivn by physical or chemical changes 
that accompany growth such as shift in 
pH reduction of hemoglobin and inhlbi 
tion of hemolysis 

The choice of the method used depends 
to a large extent on the facilities and ex 
perience of the laborator> personnel It does 
not necessarily follow that a laborious tech 
niquc such as the tubc*dilullon method is 
more accurate than a simpler technique 
such as a diffusion method By the tube 
method gross errors can be obtained if the 
following factors are not taken into consid 
cration and adcquatel) controlled the size 
of the Inoculum the solubility and stability 
of the antibiotic being tested the composi

growth requirements of the organisms be

method gives results that are stnctl> quali 
tatUe The size of the zone of inhibition 
depends on both the solubilit) and di/Tusi 
biluy of the antibiotic and does not neces 
sanly comcide with antibacterial activity 

The important factors in all antibiotic 
susceplibihty testing regardless of the pro 
cedure used are to make certain that the 
method is accurate and reproducible that 
all Steps are earned out precisely with ade 
quate controls and that the results are re 
ported properl> (Goldin and Davidsohn 
1954) 


There are many “short cuts practiced in 
antibiotic susceptibility testing that should 
be avoided if possible In cases of life 
threatening infections it might be advisable 
to attempt to determine the relative sus 
cepubihty of the invading organisms di 
rectly from the specimen In general how 
ever there is no adequate substitute for 
cuUunng the specimen determining the 
possible etiologic agent and performmg 
accurate susceptibility tests on those or 
ganisms for which tests may be useful 
Susceptibility tests to the following organ 
Isms arc ordinarily unnecessary since they 
have thus far shown no tendency to change 
in resistance Streptococcus pyogenes Dip 
lococctis pneumoniae and Neisseria menin 
gtlidts For organisms such as the following 
susceptibility tests may be imperative 
coll acrogenes group Proteus Pseuilomonas 
flcriK/inosu Staphylococcus nureus and 
Streptococcus faecalis 

Antibiotic susceptibility tests done on 
mixed cultures directly from the specimen 
arc almost worthless and may even be mis 
leading Such tests should not be done 

Proceihires 

Ttsc Tube Dilution Procedure Prepare 
twofold serial dilutions of the antibiotics as 
follows Place ten sterile 13 x 100 mm 
test tubes in a rack To each of the last 
nine tubes add 0 5 ml of Penassay or 
irjiuicase soy broth To the first and second 
tubes add 0 5 ml of a solution of the anti 
bioijc containing 100 or 1000 units per ml 
Mix and transfer 0 5 ml from the second 
tube to the third tube Continue this process 
until the last tube is reached and discard 
the last 0 5 ml 

In the same broth used for the test 
prepare a 1 100 or 1 1000 dilution of the 
organism to be tested Add 1 5 ml of this 
suspension to each tube of the senes as 
well as to a control tube containing no 
antibiotic Incubate the tubes at 37° C 
overnight and note inhibition of growth of 
the organisms in each tube The least 
amount of antibiotic resulting in complete 
inhibition of growth is the endpoint and is 
recorded as the MIC (minimal inhibitory 
concentration) The first tube of the senes 
would contain 25 units per ml if the 100 
unit solution of antibiotic was used the 
second 22 5 the third 6 25 and so on 

The concentration of antibiotic used to 
prepare the stock solution (which is then 
further diluted) depends in part on the 
nature and site of the infection It is ob 
vious that an organism not inhibited by

complete inhibition is obtained 

Vgar Dillusion (Disc) Mt-thud This 
method is the simplest and most rapid for 
the determination of susceptibility of ml 
croorganisms to antibiotics but It is subject 
to the shortcomings mentioned previously 

1 The medium used can be either in 
fusion or blood agar For testing suscepii 
biht> to sulfonamide drugs Mueller Hinton 
agar should be used 

2 The growth from a young broth cul 
turc of the organism is streaked over the 
surface of the plate with a stcnle cotton 
swab in such a manner as to allow a uni 
form confluent growth Alternatively the 
specimen or exudate may be suspended in 
broth and then streaked on the plate This 
should not be a routine procedure for rca 
sons discussed previously 

3 The inoculated plate is placed m the 
incubator and allowed to dry thoroughly 
because extra moisture will tend to leach 
out the antibiotics in the filter paper and 
give erroneous results 

4 Discs are then placed on the plates at 
equidistant intervals taking care that the 
medium makes contact with the entire sur 
face of the disc Tlie discs may be of three 
ijpcs the “wet disc" prepared by dipping 
sterile Alter paper discs into solutions of 
the antibiotic just before adding them onto 
the plate dried discs prepared commercially 
or In the laboratory or multiple discs con 
taming several different antibiotics in one 
unit The Important factor in the choice 
of discs is that they be of the proper 
potency and be carefully standardized (Fig 
17-19) 

The Anal concentration of antibiotic in 
the disc for each antibiotic is computed by 
comparing the zones of inhibition obtained 
with different concentrations of antibiotics 
in the discs with the minimal inhibitory 
concentrations determined by the tube dilu 
tion method (Table 17-4) 

5 The plates are incubated at 37“ C 
overnight or until growth develops In some 
cases particularly if heavy inoculations 
have been made m the morning readmgs 
can be taken after Ave to six hours 

Readings are based upon the presence or 
absence of a disunct zone of inhibition 
around the discs The diameter of the zone 


747 

of inhibition varies with the antibiotic and 
with the test organism and actual meas 
urements of zone sizes should not be made 
The results b> tins method are stnctly 
qualitative and the diameter of the zone 
of inhibition does not indicate the relative 
effectiveness of the antibiotic If two 
strengths of antibiotics are used results 
should be reported as follows

surface and dned discs containing differ 
ent concentrations of dihydrostrcptomycin 
isomcotinic acid hydrazide (INH) vio- 
mycin para aminosahcjhc acid (PAS) 
or other drugs desired are placed on the 
surface The plites ire then scaled and 
incubated for sufficient time to allow good 
growth this may require two to eight 
weeks The presence of zones of inhibition 
surrounding the discs indicates suscepubll 
ity to that agent as discussed previously 

Liquid Media Liquid media such as 
Proskauers and Becks or Dubos are 
made up in measured volumes and stcnl 
ized To these tubes sufficient concentra 
Mons of antibiotics are added aseptfcally 
These usually consist of 1 10 and 100 
meg of sireptomycin 1 5 and 25 meg of 
INH and 1 10 and 100 meg of P A S 
Various combinations of these or other 
drugs may be used as required and the 
concentrations may be varied if necessary 

Each tube is inoculated with 0 1 ml of 
a 10-day-old growing culture or a drop of a 
suspension of a culture is ground in a mor 
tar with the medium A control tube con 
taming no drug is inoculated at the same 
time All tubes are incubated at 37^ C and 
readings at seven-day intervals are taken 
The least amount of chemothcnpcutle 
agent that prevents growth is recorded as 
the susceptibility level of the strain tested 

Solid Midia This procedure has the ad 
vantage of allowing the same medium to 
be used for isolation and for susceptibility 
tests and is more satisfactory for perform 
mg ibis test directly from the pathologic 
material than is cither of the two methods 
described previously However the material 
must contain a moderately large amount of 
tubercle bacilli and must be carefully di 
gested and concentrated before it can be 
used successfully Performing the test 
using a pure culture of the strain being 
tested is obviously more satisfactory pro 
vided the delay in time is not objection

or similar media may be used The medium 
Is prepared as usual Just before inspissa

antibiotic are also included The slants are 
incubated and examined weekly for Six

The estimation of the amounts of a gi\en 
antibiotic in a body fluid is not so fre 
quently required as in the past, since \ery 
large doses are usually gi\en Tlic methods 
bnelly described can be readily adapted to 
the determination of other antibiotics 

PxNiciLUN (Method of Randall, Price, 
AND Webb) 

J The test organism is Bacillus subtiUs, 
N RR L strain 558 

2 Place 0 5 ml of Penassay broth m 
nme small test tubes Prepare serial dilu 
tions of the fluid being tested (which must 
be stenie) by adding 0 5 ml to tubes 1 
and 2, mix and transfer 0 5 ml from tube 
2 to tube 3 and so on to tube 9 Discard 
0 5 ml from tube 9 

3 Prepare a standard for companson 
b> diluting penicilbn of known potency 
(reference standard) to one unit per ml m 
broth Dilute this one unit standard exactly 
as for the body fluid in a second series of 
tubes, each contaming 0 5 ml of broth 

4 Add 1 5 ml of a 1 100 dilution of an 
18 hour culture of the test organism to all 
tubes Incubate at 37® C oi'emight 

5 The endpoint is last tube in which 
no grouth occurred Determine the con 
centration of the unknowm by comparing 
the endpoint wth that of the standard For 
example 

Tube Nol2345G789 
Standard 0000000 + + 
Serum AOOOO + + -1-4- + 
Scrum B000000 004- 

In this example the standard caused 
complete inhibition in the seventh tube 
Since this represents one unit per ml 
serum A contains 0 125 umt per ml be- 
cause It required a solution eight tunes as 
strong to cause complete inhibition Serum 
B thus contains 2 umts per ml 

To determine potencies lower than these. 
It IS only necessary to vary the dilution 
senes of both the standard and the un 
knoivn 


Streptomycin (Method of Price, 
Nielsen, and Welch) 

1 The test orgamsm is BactliHs cir- 
ciilans, A T C C No 9966 

2 Place 0 5 ml of streptomycin assay 
broth m stenie 12 x 100 mm tubes and 
make senal dilutions by halves as for peni 
cillm 

3 Prepare a standard for companson by 
diluting a streptomycin salt of known po 
tency in broth to contain 10 meg of the 
base per ml Senally dilute this standard 
in the same manner as the body fluid 

4 To all tubes add 1 5 ml of a 1 100 
dilution of an overnight culture of the test 
orgamsm in broth 

5 Incubate overnight at 37° C and con 
sider the last tube m which no growth oc 
curred as the endpoint 

6 The interpretation is similar to that 
described for penicillin

Medical Mycology 


By JAMES G SHAFFER. Sc D , and MILTON GOLDLN, M S 


Many clinical pathologists and medical 
technologists become discouraged m their 
attempts to study fungi because of the un 
famihar nomenclature the confusing syn 
onymy and muldpUcity of itucroscoptc struc 
tures and the wdely held idea that my 
cologic techmques are difficult and com 
plex In actuality once a names and 
basic concepts are mastered, the identifica 
tion of pathogenic fungi can become sun 
pier and more rapid than that of bactena 
In this chapter descnpuons of the most 
important fungi are necessarily bnef be 
cause of the limitations of space More 
detailed descriptions may be found m the 
excellent texts listed m the bibliography 
Fimgi are essentially plant hke organ 
isms belonging to the phylum Thallophyta 
Unhke the algae they lack chlorophyll and 
hence are either saprophytic or parasitic 
They reproduce by spores which germinate 
into long filaments called hyphae As the 
hyphae continue to grow and branch, they 


develop into a mat of growth called the 
mycelium (pi myceha) From the my 
cehum spores are produced in character 
istic arrangements These spores, when 
dispersed to new substrates genmnate and 
form new growths 

Reproduction of the pathogemc fungi is 
essentially asexual The simplest type of 
reproduction is that characteristic of the 
yeasts, i e , budding A true yeast is a 
fungus that is umcellular and reproduces 
by budding 

Spores formed by budding are called 
blastospores In certain fungi e g , Can 
dtda, the budding spores may elongate re 
mam attached to the parent cell, and form 
short aborti\e myceha the pseudomycelta 

In other fungi different types of spores 
are found Thev may be thick walled rest 
mg spores, the chlamydospores, or may be 
formed by rectangular segmentation of the 
my cehum the arthTospores Those formed 
at the end of a specialized branch of the

hypha the conidiophore, are known as co- 
nidia The conidia vary greatly in size and 
shape and these differences help to iden 
tify many species Small conidia are known 
as mtcTocomdia and large multicellular 
ones as macroconidia Spindle shaped mac 
roconidia such as those found in the genus 
Microsponim, are called f«seau.T (Fig 
18-1) 

Fungi assoaated %vith human disease 
can be divided into those affecting only the 
superficial keratinized layers of the skin — 
the dermatophytes, those capable of infect 
ing the deeper tissues or organs within the 
body — the deep or systemic fungi and 
those that are intermediate 1 e capable of 
producing either superficial or deep infec 
tions (or both) Techmques of isolating 
and identifying these organisms depend on 
demonstrating them in tissue by direct cx 
amlnation and culturing them on media 
dex-lsed for that purpose Success in identi 
fylng these organisms depends to a large 


extent on understanding the biology of the 
organisms and the nature of the disease in 
which they are involved As in many other 
cases there must be a close association 
between the cliniaan and the laboratory as 
far as fungus diseases are concerned The 
clinical impression should always be sub- 
stantiated by appropriate laboratory tests 
a number of which are to be described 
(Table 18-1) 

ACTINOMICOSIS 

The Actinomyces and Nocardia groups 
stricti) speaking are not true fungi, since 
they belong to the class Schizom>cetes 
which includes the bactena However the> 
do differ in many respects from bacteria 
and may be thought of as primitive fungi 
transmonal to the bacteria 

Actinomycosis is caused by an obligate 
anaerobic organism known as Actinomyces

thoracic form is found mostly in the lungs 
with small abscess cavitation resembling 
pulmonary tuberculosis The fungus may 
Invade directly through the chest wall 
forming numerous draimng smuses Ab 
domlnal actinomycosis is a serious form 
usually occumng by way of the cecum or 
appendut A wide \ anetj of symptoms may 
be produced depending on the organ in 
\ohed Sinuses may appear in the abdom 
inal wall and the infection may spread to 
the vertebral bodies 

The disease is ivorldwide in distnbudon 
The orgamsm is normally present in the 


mucous membranes of the mouth arouhd 
carious teeth and in tonsillar crjiits 
Trauma teeth extractions fractures and 
other conditions that may set up anaerobic 
conditions predispose to miasion and in 
fection The infection is not ordinarily 
transmitted from man to man or from cat

Lalioratory Diagnosis Pus material 
from draining sinuses and sputum should 
be examined in the fresh state for the 
presence of “sulfur granules These gran 
ules arc lobulated masses composed of deli 
cate mtertwined filaments about 1 micron

NOC VUDIOSIS 

This disease which is caused by several 
species of aerobic actinomycetes may 
manifest itself as an acute or chronic 
suppurative granulomatous Infection char 
acterized by swelling abscess formation 
and multiple draining sinuses A prunary 
pulmonary form that also occurs may oc 
caslonally metastasize to other organs of 


the body The pulmonary form may slm 
ulatc tuberculosis clinically The organisms 
are gram positive baciUiform filaments 
and some stains are partially add fast they 
may be confused with Mycobactemim tii 
bcrculom when seen on smears The ab- 
dominal form may also be confused with 
tuberculosis Since the treatment and con

as a wet preparation for the presence of 
granules the ends of which are usually 
not club shaped Smears of this material 
show gram positite mtertivuung branch 
mg filaments measunng approximately 1 
micron m diameter or short diphtheroid

Neelsen method some filaments appear to 
be acid fast Smce this aad fast property 
is onl} partial the decolonzation tWch acid 
alcohol must not be prolonged One per 
cent sulfunc acid gl^es better results than 
hydrochloric acid as a decolonzer for this 
organism (Fig 18-5) 

Pus and sputum when stained show 
gram positwe or acid fast filaments The 
acid fast varieties may be mistaken for tu 
bercle baciUi m stamed sputum smears 
Since the pulmonary form of nocardiosis 
may clinically resemble tuberculosis it is 
important to differentiate this orgamsm cul 
turally from Af tuberculosis Some strains 
of Nocardia cannot survive the acid or al 
kaU concentration methods used for M 
tuberculosis It is essential to attempt to 
isolate these organisms before concentra 
tion IS attempted 

The orgamsms grow well on Sabouraud s 
or blood agar at 37® C or at room tempera 
ture Media containing antibiotics or cy 
clohexumde should not be used In contrast 
to Actinomyces Israeli Nocardia is aerobic 
Colomes appear in four to eight days They 
are raised irregular and usually wnnkled

THE DERMATOrHVTES 

Superficial infections of the sVdn caused 
by fungi (dermatophytosis dermatomyco 
Sis) are exceedingly common athletes 
foot and ringworm of the scalp are well 
knoivn Hypersensitivity to the fungi un 
doubtedly plays an important role in the 
pathogenesis of these diseases 

The fungi attack only the keratimzed 
dead layers of the skin nails and hair A 
common lesion caused by these organisms 
IS known as "nngivorm or tmea in which 
the lesion spreads m a circle about a heal 
ing scaly, central portion CbnicaJJy the 
dermatomycoses can be classified according 
to the area of the body involved Tinea 
pedis athletes foot” is a common infec 
tion producmg a pruntic or vesicular mac 
eratlon between the toes or on the plantar 
surfaces of the feet Burning itching and 
pain may develop and pyogenic Infections 
may be superimposed Infections of the 


757 

nails, tinea unguium, may be caused by the 
same group of fungi as on the feet but may 
also be due to Candida albicans These in 
fections are difficult to diagnose clinically 
since many other conditions can cause a 
similar picture Ringivorm of the scalp 
tinea capitis, is frequently found m chil 
dren and occasionally in adults In this 
condition the hair becomes brittle and 
breaks off a short distance from the sur 
face of the scalp Infection by Microsporuvi 
cants or M gijpsettm can result in a boggy 
tumor like mass known as a kenon Tncho 
phtjton schoenletm causes a seiere infec 
tion known as favus characterized by cup 
like structures (scutula) formed by the 
infected hair follicles (Fig 18-7) Hairs in 
fected by fungi may fluoresce when placed 
under a filtered ultraviolet light — Woods 
light 

Infection of the bearded regions tmea 
barbae may resemble those due to pyogemc 
bacteria Ringivorm of the groin tmea 
cruns IS common m warm climates and 
in obese individuals Ringworm of the body 
tinea corpons causes lesions that involve 
the glabrous sJon anywhere on the body 
The lesions advance slowly at the pe 
nphery and tend to heal in the center 

Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor) is 
characterized by diffuse brownish red 
scaly lesions on the trunk The causative 
agent which has never been cultured is 
known as Malassezta fiiTfuT It can be iden 
tificd readily xa skin preparations by the 
characteristic round budding cells and 
mycelial fragments (Fig X8-8)

seen as dense clouds around the hair stub 
(“eciothnx”) or as linear rows inside the 
hair shaft (“endothnx”) (Fig 18-11) 
Care must be taken to avoid confusing the 
so-called mosaic fungi or vanous artifacts 
wfh true fungi The genus and species of 
the infecting fungi can be established only 
by culture 

Cultures are made by inoculating various 
media Sabourapds> Littmans or cyclohex 
imide (Mycosel) agar are commonly used 
With the exception of Acttnomyces tsraeh 
all pathogenic fungi are aerobic Since they 
are slow growing it is best to use screw 
cap tubes for original isolation rather than 
tubes plugged with cotton All the derma 
tophytes grow well at room temperature 
If the specimen is heavily contaminated 
ivith bacteria, the addition of penicilUn and 
streptomycin (20 and 40 umts, respectively, 
per ml of medium) is advised Scales, skin 
scrapmgs and hairs may be simply dipped 
into 70 per cent alcohol and placed on 
the surface of the agar slants Exudates, 
pus, and sputum should be streaked on 
the surface of agar plates If Actinomyces 
is suspected, anaerobic procedures ate re 
quired 

Identification of the organisms is based 
on the gross appearance of the colonies, 
the rate of growth, the pigment and the 
microscopic appearance Three distinct 
types of colomes may deielop— -the yeast, 
the yeast like, and the filamentous Yeast 
colomes are smooth moist, and soft Under 
the microscope they contain only oval or 
round budding cells Yeast like colonies are 
also soft and smooth but may be shghtly 
granular Under the microscope pseudoray 
ceha and budding cells are seen Filament 
ous colomes show cottony Uke growth pro- 
jecting from the agar surface The colomes 
show myceha and vanous types of spore 
formauon under the microscope (Fig 
18-12) 

For examination of the colomes a 
straight or hooked vnre is used to pick a 
fragment of the colony to a drop of 
Amann s lacto phenol cotton blue* on a 
shde The fragment is separated apart 
gently with teasing needles and a co\er 
glass added Shght heating may help the 
stain to penetrate The preparation is then 
exammed for its charactensuc microscopic

Tnchophyton species are the most com 
mon of the dermatophytes, causing mfec

fungus grows as cottony colonies that are 
usually pigmented light tan to red The 
species are distinguished from each other 
by means of their colony appearance struc 
ture of the micro- and macrocomdia and 
vanous shapes of the hyphae (Fig 18-33) 
Common species are T mentagrophytes

THE DEEP OR SYSTEMIC FUNGI 

Fungus diseases other than those infect 
ing the skin and its appendages were at 
one time thought to be rare It is now 
recognized either because of improved di 
agnostic facihties or possibly increasing 
incidence of infection, that many of these 
conditions are more widespread than here- 
tofore realized Also there is evudence that 
the more widespread use of antibiotics 
steroids cytotoxic drugs and radiation pre- 
disposes to infection with these organisms

hlstoplasmln. Infection occurs from the In- 
halation of the infectious spores, which 
exist as saprophytes in certain types of 
soils. There may be other, as yet unidenti- 
fied, modes of infection. 

Laborator)' Diagnoiis. Smears made from 
bone marrow, lymph node biopsy speci- 
mens, and mucocutaneous lesions should 
be stained uith Wright's or Giemsa’s 
method. The fungus appears as small (1 
to 5 micro), round or oval, ycast-Iike cells 
in the cytoplasm of mononuclear ceCs or 
lying free. They appear to have a clear 
halo surrounding a darker stained central 
area (Fig. 18-22). Direct mounts or potas- 
sium hydro.xide preparations are generally 
useless because of the intracellular locali- 
zation of the organism and its small size. 

Specimens of sputum, gastric or bron- 
chial washings, and pus should be cultured 
on Sabouraud’s, cycloheximide, and brain- 
heart infusion blood agar plus antibiotics 
at room and incubator temperatures. In ad- 
dition bone marrow or blood should be 
inoculated in flasks of brain-heart infusion 
broth. All cultures should be held at least 
30 days before discarding. Freshly expec- 
torated sputum should be cultured, since 
the organism dies rapidly in sputum. 

At 37® C. (pmvth is slow (8 to 14 days), 
and the colonies are small, waxy, and mem- 


branous. Microscopically small budding or- 
ganisms resembling those seen in tissues 
and abortive hyphae are seen (Fig. 18-23). 
At room temperature white mycelial groMh 
is produced after 14 to 18 days (Ffg. 
18-24), and microscopic examination 
shows the round, ihick-walled, tuberculaie 
cblamydospores (7 to 15 micra) that are 
diagnostic for H. eapsulatum (Fig. 18-25). 
Repeated search for these chlamydosporcs 
may be necessary, since they arc occasion- 
ally sparse. 'They rarely grow on blood agar 
but can be demonstrated by transplanting 
the colonics to Sabouraud's agar. Intra- 
pcritoneal injection into mice sometimes 
gii’es a positive Isolation \vhen cultural 
procedures fail. 

Complement-fixing antibodies, which re- 
act either with histoplasmin or yeast phase 
antigens of H. eapsulatum, appear a few 
rvccks after Infection. Serial tests must be 
made throughout the course of the disease 
in order to demonstrate a rise In titer. Other 
serologic tests that may be useful are the 
collodion particle test of Saslaw and Camp- 
bell, the latex procedure of Carlisle and 
Saslaw (1958), and a precipitin reaction 
In agar-gel (Ileiner, 1058). Positive skin 
tests to a standardized preparation of his- 
toplasmin indicate past or present infec- 
tion. although the skin tests of acutely ill

Sporofric/iosi; 

Sporotnchosis, caused by Spowtnchum 
schencku, is a subacute Infection, which 
follows introduction of the fungus by 
trauma From the initial lesion, wluch be 
gins as a small, subcutaneous pustule, the 
regional lymphatics are invaded The lymph 
nodes show cord hke thickening, and mul 
tiple abscesses appear along the course of 
the infected lymphatics Occasionally gen 
erahzed infection may occur by way of the 
blood vnth or tvithout primary cutaneous 
lesions, and any organ or tissue of the 
body may be imolved 

The disease occurs throughout the world, 
and the fungus is widely distributed in 


nature Jniections occur Soliowing injury to 
the skin with contaminated material Farm- 
ers, horticulturists, and miners are most 
frequently infected 

Laboratory Diagnosis The organisms are 
difficult to demonstrate in stamed smears 
or sections, cultures being the most reliable 
procedure (Fig 18-26) Pus from lesions 
or swabs from infected areas should he 
streaked on Sabouraud s or cyclohcximide 
agar at room temperature and at 37° C At 
room temperature the colonies appear with 
moderate rapidity and are small uhite to 
black, yeast like, and without aenal my- 
celia Microscopically the colony is com 
posed of debcate, branching, septate h>- 
phae upon which spherical or pear shaped 
comdia are borne at the end of lateral 
branches in a characteristic tree like clus 
ter (Fig 18-27).

THE I^TER^IED^VTE FUNGI 

Certain fungi notabi} the Candida group 
may cause either superficial infections or 
widespread systenuc disease and hence are 
classified as “intemiediate ” 

Cattdidiasts {Moriiliasu) 

Candida (Momlia') albicans can cause 
infection of the mouth skin nails or 
vagina or a ^anety of systemic diseases 
Or^ infection sometimes found in nen 
bom infants results in thick creamy white 
patches known as "thrush " Infection of the 
comers of the mouth is called "perleche*’ 
A common condition found most frequently 
in pregnant and diabetic ivomen is a toIvo- 
vagin^ infection known as laginal moni 
basis or mondial \agmitis Infections of 
the nads are knoivn as onychia and of the 
cuticle as paronychia Infection of the in 
tertnginous areas of the body i e the 
axdla gluteal folds and groin are known 
as “intertrigo ” 

More senous infections are those m\oI\ 
mg the lungs — bronchopulmonary candi 
diasis — and those in\oh'mg other organs of 
the body Brain abscesses endocarditis and 
septicemia may be caused by this organ 
isra (Figs ie-31 18-32) 

Candida albicans is frequently present in 
the skin mucous membranes and intes 
tinal tract of normal indinduals Conse 
quently infections are probably primarily 
endogenous in origin Predisposing factors 
mclude diabetes pregnancy obesity and 


avitaminosis Occupational conditions that 
cause maceration of the skin predispose to 
cutaneous infections Severe or fatal cases 
have occurred in patients treated with an 
tibiotics in these cases the orgamsm pro- 
liferates abundantly to replace the normal 
bacterial flora Hypersensitivity undoubt 
edly plays an important role in the patho- 
genesis of the disease The disease is world 
wide in distribution 

Laboratory Diagnosis C albicans is the 
only consistently patbogemc species of the 
several yeast bke fungi of the genus hence 
It IS important to differentiate it from the 
other species Skin and nail scrapings 
should be mounted on a slide with 30 per 
cent potassium hydroxide Sputum mucus 
and pus should be crushed to a thin film 
and examined fresh The material can also 
be stained by Gram s method or with 
methylene blue or Jactophenol cotton blue 
Candida appears in such preparations as 
sniail oval budding yeast bke cells 3 to 
G micra in diameter occasional fragments 
of myceba can be seen The organism 
stains intensely positive by Grams method 
(Fig 18-33) 

Cultures should be inoculated on Sa 
bourauds cycloheximide or other media a 
wide variety of which have been developed 
for this purpose The orgamsm grows 
rapidly and readily at either room or in 
cubator temperature appearing in two to 
four days as creamy moist flat colonies 
with a distinct yeasty odor (Fig 18-34)

species C stellatoidea which is occasion 
ally found in vaginitis produces starhke 
colonies on blood agar It is thought by 
some that this organism represents only a 
morphologic variant of C albicans rather 
than a distinct species Microscopically 
clusters of oval budding blastospores are 
seen with occasional small fragments of 
mycelia 

To differentiate C albicans from other 
species a simple procedure is as follows 
A colony is picked with a straight wire and 
deep cuts are made with a hooked ivire 
into a plate of com meal zein or chlamydo 
spore agar* A sterile cotershp is placed 
over the streak After 24 to 48 hours 
incubation at room temperature the prepa 
ration is exammed with the low power 

* An excellent medium for the demonstration at 
chlamydospoies is Cream of Rice— Tween 80 agar 
which 16 prepared as follows 1 part of Cream of 
Rice is added to boiling tap water to which 1 per cent 
agar and 1 volume per cent Tween-80 arc added The 
medium is autoclaved and poured In plates

objectHe through the covershp Along the 
streak C albicans produces pseudomycelia 
beanng clusters of blastospores and charac 
tenstic thick walled round chlamydospores 
(Fig 18-35) Other procedures have been 
developed to differenuate the species of 
Candida in most cases they are unneces 
sary for chnical purposes 

Although there have been many studies 
on the immunology of C albicans and a 
skin test preparation known as Oidiomjdn 
IS available none have been shown to be 
of value in diagnosis 

Geotnchosts 

Geotnchosis is an infection caused by a 
yeast like organism known as Geotnchum 
candtdum This fungus resembles C albi 
cans In many respects and may cause oral 
bronchopulmonary or systemic infections 
It can be found frequently in the mouth or 
intestinal tract of normal individuals Con 
sequently the diagnosis of geotnchosis like 
that of candidiasis is )ustified only by re 
peated demonstrations of the organism and 
exclusion of other possible etiologic agents 

Fresh preparations or those mounted in 
10 per cent potassium hydroxide or lacto- 
phenol cotton blue show oblong or rectang 
ular arthrospores (4 to 8 micra) or larger 
sphencal cells 

The organism grows rapidly on Sabou 
rauds agar at either room or Incubator 
temperature The colony is large and mealy 
and grows mostly below the surface of the 
agar There arc deep radial furrows and 
older colonies may have a coarse aenal

Viral and Rickettsial Diseases 


By JAMES C SHAFfER, Sc D . and MILTON GOLDIN, M S 


Laboratory procedure*' used m the diagnosis 
of \'iral and rickettsial diseases follow the 
same general principles as those used in 
the bactenal and mycotic diseases, but 
there are some important critical differ 
ences Close cooperation between the physi 
Clan and the laborator) is essential, since 
the choice of procedure is likely to be de 
temuned by clinical considerations 

Depending on the type of condition, one 
or more of three general approaches may 
be followed First, It may be possible to 
demonstrate characteristic pathologic 
changes in stamed sections of tissue biopsy 
specimens or to show in stained smears 
cell structures or inclusions typical of a 
certain disease (smallpox, %acania. herpes, 
trachoma, and ^^arts) Second, an attempt 
may be made to isolate and identify the 
nrus, utilizing chick embryo tissue cul 
ture, or a susceptible animal (Arbor ^^ruses, 
poliomjebtis ECHO, Coxsackie) Third, 
serologic methods may be applied, utJizing 
acute and convalescent sera tested simul 
taneously by complement fixation, neutrali 
zation, hemagglutination, or hemagglutma 
tion inhibition 

An approach to the rapid, specific diag 
nosis of some of the v-iral diseases (hat may 
prove to be of great value m the near Xu 
ture IS that of the use of fluorescent anti 
body methods (see p 618) Liu (195S), 
for example, has shown that it is possible 
to diagnose influenza infection from nasal 
smears on the same day as the collection 
of the speamen The technique, either di- 
rect or indirect, seems at this time to be 
most promising m the diagnosis of rabies, 
the pox viruses, herpes, and the L G V 


group It may be that, when these tech 
niques are perfected enough to be practical 
for the routine laboratory, they may replace 
in good part diagnostic procedures now in 
use, which are of value primarily onlv 
retrospectively 

In addition there are many laboratory 
procedures, other ilian those to be men 
tioned (cell counts, biochemical tests), that 
are useful in the diagnosis of viral and 
rickettsial diseases They are described else 
where in this book 

Knowledge of wbat specimens to collect 
and of how they should be handled and 
prepared for exammation is important 
Preparations for microscopic examination 
can be made easily and require no special 
equipment or material other than stains 
IsolaUon and identification of viruses and 
serologic testing require special equipment 
reagents, animal quarters, and incubators 
and have up to now been to a great extent 
research procedures However, many of the 
reagents needed for serologic testing and 
tissue culture that are difficult to prepare 
in routme laboratories are now available 
commercially, and the techniques have 
been simplified sufficiently for routine use 
in smaller laboratories Space does not per- 
mit a detailed description of all the meth 
ods that may be used in the diagnosis of 
viral and rickettsial diseases Emphasis will 
be placed on the collection and handling 
of specimens and a few simple techniques 
of examination will be described

pared and stained Cutaneous lesions (\an 
ola \accmia herpes simplex) should be 
scraped uith a scalpel or similar mstrument 
and the scrapings spread thinly o%er a 
clean slide and allowed to dry The sbde 
should be thoroughlj cleaned before use 
and the spreading done mth care so as not 
to destroy the ceU structure From ocular 
lesions smears should be made from ma 
terial expressed from the conjunctival fol 
licles The use of cotton pledgets is not 
recommended The best stains for these 
preparations are Giemsa Macchiaxello or 
Castaneda (see Appendix p 932) 

It may be desirable to obtain biopsj or 
postmortem material for examination Such 
material should be placed in a fixauie im 
mediately Special fixatiies may be used 
but for general purposes Zenker s fluid with 
10 per cent formdin is satisfactory Sec 
uons stained with hematoxylin and eosin 
can then be exammed for charactenstic 
cells and cell structures 


M kTERIAL AND METHODS FOR 
ISOLATION AhTD IDENTIFICATION 
OF \ IRUSES AND RICKETTSIAE 

The source of matenals for the isolation 
of viruses or nckettsiae depends on the 
condition with which one is deabng For 
most of the upper respiratory diseases 
throat washings are to be recommended 
This includes influenza and some of the 
Coxsackie viruses In poliomyelitis and the 
ECHO Coxsackie infections throat washings 
may be used but stools are the matenal of 
choice in most cases In some viral dis 
eases of the central nervous system spinal 
fluid may be used In most of the viral 
encephalitides the virus can be isolated 
from the spinal fluid only in the very early 
stages of the disease In fatal conditions 
viral isolation can be accomplished most 
readily with tissues obtained at autopsy 
Blood may be used in some viral infections 
Tissue biopsy may be done in certain dis- 
eases especially the exanthematous condi 
t ons such as smallpox vaccima and 
herpes Positive findmgs are significant but 
failure to isolate a virus from a given 
specimen cannot be considered definitive 

Most laboratones regardless of size can 
collect suitable material for virus isotauon 
but only m the larger laboratones can 
actual isolation and identification be ac- 


complished The smaller laboratones can 
usually send matenal to larger laboratones 
for this purpose 

CoUecttoji of Feces 

%Vhen feces are collected for virus isola 
non several grams should be collected in 
a wide mouth bottle or stiff paper carton 
The specimen should be frozen immediately 
and kept in a dry ice box or electncally 
operated deep freezer at —20° C to — 70° 
C Some specimens require the lower tern 
perature if kept long For shipment the 
specimen must be packed in dry ice m a 
suitable container To prepare the feces for 
inoculation into a tissue culture or an am 
mal the specimen Is emulsified to about a 
10 per cent concentration in stenie dis 
tilled water and centnfuged to remove 
gross particles Then the supernatant is 
treated with ether or antibiotics to destroy 
bacteria Penicilhn (500 umts per ml ) and 
streptomycin (2 5 mg per ml ) are the 
antibiotics most frequently used Bactenal 
cultures are always done pnor to use of 
the specimen 

When It is difficult to collect feces one 
may use an anal swab The swab may be 
placed in 0 5 ml of broth or other diluent 
and frozen or it may be placed in a tube 
containing 2 or 3 ml of 50 per cent gly 
cenn saline Glycenn used for this purpose 
must be the purest available Glycerin has 
long been used as a preservative for viruses 
and has the advantage of destroying bac 
tcDa in a relatively short time It also in 
activates viruses but much more slowly 

TbriMt liastiiMgs 

Throat washings are useful in respiratory 
viral diseases as well as in poliomyelitis 
They are collected as follows The patient 
should gargle with 10 to 15 ml of fluid 
which can be broth skim milk or distilled 
water The gargling should be done two or 
three times with the same fluid and the 
fluid collected in a sealable container It 
IS helpful to have the patient cough up 
material from tlie trachea The washings 
are then transferred to a closed tube and 
frozen qmckly to — 70° C in dry ice or a 
low temperature freezer If the washings 
are to be examined within two or three 
days they may be treated with penicillin 
(500 units per ml ) and streptomvcin (125 
unUs per rid ) and stored at 4° C WTicn 
the frozen washings are thawed they are

also treated wth penicillin and streptomj 
an before use in the experimental animal 
or tissue culture 

Collection of Mnterial from Lesions on the 
Skin or Mucous Membranes 

Fluid or exudate from \esiclcs or other 
superfiaal lesions (herpes simplex small 
pox vaccmia herpangina) can be col 
lectcd on cotton swabs Such swabs may 
be placed in 0 5 ml of broth or other 
suitable diluent and frozen until use or 
they may be placed in 50 per cent glycerin 
salme In either case they are handled in 
the same way as the anal swab Some work 
ers prefer to sohdify the glycerin sahne by 
adding 1 0 per cent agar 

Collection of Tissue Specimejii 

The chance for nrus isolation from tis 
sues as with most other specimens is best 
in those collected m the first few days of 
illness or in those collected when death 
has occurred m the first fi\e dajs or so 
of illness In some diseases biopsy spcci 
mens may be taken from lesions in others 
such as the viral encephabtides tissue can 
be obtained at autopsy When possible the 
tissues should be collected aseptically but 
m many instances this cannot be done In 
either case the tissue should be placed in 
sterile containers and handled aseptically 
thereafter The tissue may be stored at re 
frigerator temperature (4® C ) for one or 
two days but ideally particularly if longer 
storage or shipment is necessary the tissue 
should be frozen placed m an adequately 
sealed container and held at —70° C The 
seal must be tight to prevent entry of 
carbon dioxide during storage or shipment 
Shipment requires that the tissues be 
packed in a thermos or other suitable con 
tamer with enough dry ice to last dunng 
transit 

To prepare tissue suspensions for in 
oculation into embryonated eggs or am 
mals the tissue must be ground in a mor 
tar or suitable grinder using sterile sand 
alundum or other suitable abrasive It is 
not advisable to use an ordinary elecincally 
driven blender because of the production of 
aerosols If a blender is to be used special 
precautions are essential 

When grinding tissue in a mortar the 
tissue should first be ground with the 
abrasive and then enough distilled water 
added to make a paste After further grind 
mg enough diluent is added to make a 30 


per cent tissue suspension The diluent to 
be used depends on the virus and the tissue 
being examined and it is well to check on 
this in any speafic case Peniallm (500 
umts per ml ) and streptomycin (500 units 
per ml ) are added and the material sedi 
mented in a centrifuge to clarify the su 
pematant Sot moculation Bacten^ suhcul 
tures should always he done before use 

Coliection of Blood and Spinal Tliiid 

In the early stages of some diseases the 
virus may be present m the blood or spinal 
fluid These materials should be collected 
and handled aseptically throughout It is 
also important to heparinize blood since 
the virus may attach to the cellular ele 
ments and be absent from the serum If 
the blood is not heparinized the clot should 
be used The coUected spinal fluid and 
blood should be frozen at —70° C 

Spina! fluid may be used for animal in 
oculation without further treatment Blood 
should be used undiluted and in several 
senal tenfold dilutions since occasionally 
the virus is isolated only after dilution 

Animal Inoadation 

A variety of laboratory animals have 
been used for isolation of viruses (mice 
rats guinea pigs hamsters rabbits fer 
rets monkeys chimpanzees) but the 
mouse IS used most frequently Some of the 
viruses have a rather wade host range (e g 
rabies) while others have a limited range 
(eg poliomyehiis) making it very im 
portant to choose the correct animal for 
inoculation Even with viruses that have a 
wide range (here is often one particular 
laboratory animal that is more suitable 
than the others It is important that the 
virus produce visible disease or death since 
unapparent infections can be detected only 
by serologic means In some instances cer 
tarn strains of a given species of animal 
may be more susceptible than other strains 
of the same species For example some 
strains of mice are highly susceptible to 
influenza virus while other strains are re 
sistant The age and condition of the am 
mal used may be important Old or poorly 
pounshed animals should never be used 
In many instances well fed young adult 
animals are most desirable In recent years 
suckling mice (one to four days old) have 
been used extensively with some of the 
viruses especially the Coxsackie group An 
other important point is to make sure that 



780 


Clinical Diagnosis Laboratory Methods 


the colony from which the animals are 
obtained is free of infection that may con 
fuse the issue 

The route of inoculation of the suscep 
tible animal is important Animals may be 
maculated intracerebrall) intraienously 
mtrapentoneall> mtranasally subcutane- 
ously mtracutaneously or by mouth It is 
not unusual to find that a susceptible am 
mal ma> be infected regularly b> one route 
of inoculation and onlj rarely bj another 
V/ith influenza yttus intranasal inoculation 
may consistently produce highlj fatal dis 
ease but the subcutaneous route will pro- 
duce oiert disease only infrequently 

Thus It is important to choose the proper 
animal and route of moculation to Insure 
the best chance of virus isolation In actual 
practice it may be beneficial to use more 
than one speaes of ammal and to inoculate 
by more than one route This is especially

in the bibhography 

Inociilatton into the Embryonaled Egg 

The embryonated hens egg has been 
used extensiiely for varus isolation and 
propagauon (Fig 19-1) It has several ad 
vantages over animals First it has a wide 
range of susceptibihty Second it is small 
and requires a minimum of space conse 
quently large numbers can be made aiail 
able Third it is much less expensive in 
iniDal cost and maintenance Finally in 
most locations fertile hen s eggs are readilj 
available In some situaticns one must ob- 
tarn the fertile eggs and incubate them to 
the desired age in others one can obtam 
the embryonated eggs from a hatcher> 

The susceptibihty of the embrjo to a 
given varus may vary somewhat with its 
age and also with the route by which m 
oculaboo IS made Thus one must ascei 
tain what age embryo and what route of 
inoculation to use m a given situation The 
most common routes by which moculation 
IS accompbshed are directly into the yolk 
sac (psittacosis nckettsiae) on the chono 
allantoic membrane (po\ viruses) Into the 
allantoic sac into the ammoUc sac (influ 
enza) or into the brain Space does not 
allow for a description of all the various 
(echmqucs These can be found in v'anous 
excellent texts and manuals some of which 
are cited in the bibliography 




Viral and Rickettsim Diseases 


781 


The recognition of the presence of a virus 
in the inoculated embr\o depends on the 
production of some Msible response or on 
the demonstration of \irus by special tech 
nfqucs such as a stained smear from ccr 
tain tissues or the hemagglutlnitlon tech 
nique Some iiruses produce pock like 
lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane or 
there may be visible lesions on the embryo 
itself Stained smears from such lesions 
may reveal typical intracellular inclusions 
Some viruses and rickettsiae propagate in 
the yolk sac membrane but may produce 
only little macroscopically apparent change 
However vvhen smears from this mem 
brane are stained with an appropriate stain 
(Macchiavello or Castaneda) one may see 
large numbers of viral or rickettsial bodies 
(Fig 19-2) Other viruses produce death 
of the embrvo without specifi’' visible Ic 
sions Inilucnza virus when inoculated into 
the ammoUc or allantoic sac may produce 
no visible lesions hut its presence can be 
detected by its capacity to cause tlic clump 
ing of the red blood cells of certain species 
of animals Chemagglutlnatlon) 

The final identification of an isolated 
virus depends on serologic testing with 
known antisera For this the neutralization 
test has been used cMcnsivcly There are 
several techniques for doing such tests 
They are not easy to perform and should 
only be done by laboratories with adequate 
equipment and trained personnel 

Complement Nation and other classic 
serologic tests with knoun antisera may 
also be used as aids in the identification of 
viruses and rickettsiae 

Tunic Culture 

Tissue culture has been used In the study 
of viruses for some time but only recently 
have techniques been developed that allow 
for the possibility of the extensive use of 
tissue culture as an aid in diagnostic work 
This has resulted from the introduction of 
simplified procedures the use of antibiotics 
to obviate some of the pitfalls of incidental 
bacterial contamination and the estabbsh 
ment of standard lines of cultured cells 
eg HeLa) Excellent tissue culture re- 
agents can be obtained commercially and 
detailed descriptions of the techniques are 
available One can also obtain tissue cul 
tures ready for use from commercial 
sources 

Tissue culture methods have already con 
tnbuted much valuable informauon in the 
epidemiologic investigation of certain virus 
diseases among them pohomyelitts and 


Coxsackic These methods have also re 
suited 111 the isolation of numerous pre 
viously unknown agents such as the adeno 
viruses and ECHO \iruses some of which 
have not yet been associated with definite 
clinicil diseases Tissue culture methods 
will probably gradually replace much of the 
more time consuming and expensive am 
mal Inoculation in diagnostic work The 
npid advances made in tissue culture 
methods should before long make it pos 
siWc for rchtiveJy small laboratories to 
utilize these techniques to great advantage 

Not only can a large number ox viruses 
be isolated and identified In tissue culture 
but it IS also possible to test patients sera 
rapidly and economically for neutralizing 
antibody Such procedures are useful in 
both diagnostic and epidemiologic investi 
gations 

Serologtc Tests 

The diagnostic aid most widely used in 
viral and rickettsial diseases is serologic 
testing The demonstration of a nse in titer 
of an antibody against a specific agent in 
sera collected at proper intervals may be 
diagnostic Complement fixation neutrall 
zation hemagglutination inhibition and 
agglutiniiion may all be used Complement 
fixation is used most frequently neutraliza 
tion and hemagglutination inhibition less 
extensively and agglutination least fre 
quently 

Small laboratories and private physicians 
obviously cannot perform all these serologic 
tests but all can collect the necessary 
scrum and send it to the appropnate lab 
oratory for testing Certain principles must 
be observed In order to insure the most 
satisfactory results First a brief clinical 
summary must be provided with the serum 
(some laboratories will not accept sped 
mens -without such a summary) Second 
the Wood (10 to 15 ml ) must be collected 
ttltli a dry syringe and handled with aseptic 
technique Third two or more additional 
samples must be collected at appropnate 
intervals The first sample (acute) should 
be taken as soon as possible after onset of 
symptoms the second (convalescent) 10 
to 14 days later and vvhen possible a third 
after one month Since the nse in antibody 
titer in some cases occurs fairly late the 
third specimen may be important and a 
fourth may he useful Blood should be col 
lected three to four hours after a meal 
since chylous serum may be anticomple 
mentary 

BltHjd collected with a syringe should be 


782 Clinical Diagnosis by 

transferred to a sterile tube and allowed to 
clot The clot should be loosened from the 
tube bj means of a sterile applicator stick 
or inoculatmg loop The tube may then be 
centrifuged at 1000 to 1200 rpm for 10 
to 15 mmutes or it maj be placed in the 
refrigerator overnight to allow the clot to 
retract Then the serum is collected in a 
sterile tightly capped vial or tube It may 
be stored in the refrigerator at 4° C or 
if It IS not to be tested within a few days 
It should be placed in the deep freeze The 
“acute” sample should always be held until 
the subsequent samples are collected and 
all tested simultaneously 

For shipment the serum may be sent 
unfrozen but it is better to ship it frozen 
Physicians may not have facilities for col 
lection of serum in their offices In such 
cases they may send the clotted blood sam 
pie directly to the appropriate laboratory 
If this IS to be done the blood may 
collected in the vacuum type blood coUec 
tion tubes without anticoagulant that are 
readily available commercially In this case 
the blood should be sent unmediately and 
not held until subsequent samples are 
taken Whole blood should not be frozen 
since this will result m complete hemol 
)sis The advantage of sending whole blood 
is that It reduces the chance of bacterial 
contamination but it has the disadvantage 
that if the blood is in transit too long 
there may be considerable hemolysis 
Most laboratories that do serologic tests 
espeaally the state and federal public 
health laboratories will supply self ad 
dressed mailing cartons containing sterile 
vials thus simplifying the problem of ship- 
ment It is well to find out from the lab- 
oratory what information is required with 
each specimen This will save tune and 
insure the best possible results 

Serologic Techniques 
Complement Fixation Complement fixa 
uon (CF) has as indicated before been 
used most frequently The CF technique 
has vaned with different laboratories but 
most are modifications of the Kolmer tech 
nique which is presented in another sw 
non (Chapter 23) Since the reagents 
(complement hemolysin and sheep red 
blood cells) are readdy available and a 
number of standardized viral and rickettsial 
antigens are also available commercially it 
IS possible for moderate size laboratones to 
do these tests provided the personnel have 
the special training necessary to do CF 
tests 


Laboratorv Methods 

One of the problems in the complement 
fixation test is that serums may prove to be 
anticomplementary Some serums are anti 
complementary without any obvious reason 
but there are some well recognized causes 
of anticomplementary activity These are 
bacterial contamination use of anticoagu 
lants and chylous serum All can be 
avoided by proper technique 

TTie interpretation of the results of com 
plement fixation tests is not difficult with 
experience If simultaneous testing of raid 
tiple serums reveals a fourfold or greater 
rise m titer against a specific viral antigen 
this may be considered sigmficant A two- 
fold rise is equivocal and may be the 
result of technical variation If only a single 
serum is available and a high titer (in most 
cases 1 16 to 1 32) is found this in 
some cases may represent evidence of fairly 
recent infection with the specific agent It 
is of course essential that the CF result 
be carefully correlated with the clinical pic 
ture 

Neutrauzation Tests 

The neutralization test is basec on the 
capacity of antibody to neutralize the in 
feciious properties of viruses in a manner 
similar to the neutrabzation of toxin by 
antitoxin When antibody alone is involved 
such neutralization is specific but various 
investigators have shown that normal 
serum may contain a certain amount of 
nonspecific neutralizing substance This 
nonspecific substance is gradually lost 
when serum is stored at refrigerator tern 
perature (4® C ) but is not lost when the 
scrum is stored in the deep freeze The full 
activity may be restored adding a small 
amount of fresh guinea pig serum It is 
important to remember this in testing 
paired sera smee the “acute" serum may 
have been stored long enough to lose the 
nonspecific neutrahzmg substance and the 
convalescent” serum may be fresh when 
tested This might give results indicating 
an antibody nse and be misleading 

The neutralization test can be used in 
two ways to detect specific antibody rises 
as an aid m the diagnosis of disease and 
to identify an unknown agent after its 
isolation When experimental animals are 
used to detect neutralization the test is 
lime consuming and may be fairly ex 
pensive Not many laboratories are 
equipped to do it routinely If the embry 
onated egg can be used the test is better 
from ilus standpoint Tissue culture meth 
ods make it possible for smaller labora 



Viral and Rickettsial Diseases 


rones to use this test to good ad\antage 
Space does not allow detailed descriptions 
of the neutrahzation techniques These can 
be found m vanous textbooks manuals 
and other publications (see bibliography) 

Hemagglutinin Inhibition 

A number of viruses have the capacity 
to cause the red blood cells of one or an 
other animal species to agglutinate Specific 
antibody inlubits agglutination and this 
constitutes the basis for the hemagglutimn 
mhibition test Tins test can be done easily 
in routine laboratories Senal dilutions of 
the serum are added to a standard amount 
of virus containmg fluid The mixture is 
Incubated at room temperature to allow 
reaction between mtus and antibody to 
occur A standard suspension of appropn 
ate red blood cells is then added and the 
tubes shaken thoroughly They are incu 
bated at room temperature -until the eryth 
rocjtes have settled out In the absence of 
ag^utination the cells settle as a button 
at the bottom of the tube, whereas ag 
gluunation is manifested b) irregular dis 
persion of granular clumps of cells o\er 
the bottom of the tube The hemagglutinin 
Inhibition titer of a serum is the reciprocal 
of the dilution in the last tube showing no 
agglutination A fourfold or greater nse in 
titer between the collection of acute’ and 
“convalescent serums is considered sig 
mficant 

Certain serums contain nonspecific in 
hibitory substances and unless these are 
removed the results of hemagglutinm 
inhibition tests may be misleading They 
can be removed in a number of ways but 
treatment >vith trypsin appears to be best 
The methods for standardization of the test 
can be found in various publications (see 
bibliography) 

The hemagglutination phenomenon can 
be used in some instances to detect the 
presence of virus For instance one may 
test amniouc fluid from embryonated eggs 
that have been inoculated with throat wash 
mgs from patients with suspected inflU' 
enzT Semi dilutions of the fluid combined 
with suspensions of 1 per cent washed 
chicken or guinea pig erythrocjtcs ivill 
cause agglutination of the cells if virus is 
present One may then identify this mhis 
by combining it with known antiserums 
and testing for specific inhibition of ag 
gluunation 

Agglutination 

Some \iruses and nckettsiae can be pre- 


783 

pared in a sufficiently pure form so that, 
when combined ivith serum containmg an 
Ubodies specific agglutination occurs 
Since these anugens are not easy to pre 
pare, the techmque has not been used e\ 
tensivcly 

Certain nonspecific agglutination tests 
have been used widely as aids in the diag 
nosis of viral and rickettsial diseases The 
Weil Felix test which is described in Chap 
ter 24, has been used in nckettsial dis 
eases 

Certain other nonspecific agglutination 
tests have been used as aids in the diag 
nosis of viral diseases In infectious mono 
nucleosis aggluunation of sheep red blood 
cells (the so called Paul Bunnell or pre 
sumptive test) has been used for many 
years This test is not specific and must be 
confirmed with the specific differential test 
(see p 217) Two tests have been used in 
prunary atypical pneumonia The first is 
the test for cold agglutinins, which are 
present in high titers in most severe and 
some mild cases The second is based on 
the development of agglutinins against 
Streptococcus MG The latter test is a 
straight agglutination using paired sera 
against the streptococcal antigen Neither 
ot these tests is specific and can only be 
used as aids in the diagnosis (see Chapter 
24) 

LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF 
VIRUS DISEASES 

In the following section an attempt wall 
be made to summarize critical information 
on VITUS diseases relatmg to certam diag 
nostic prmaples In certain cases these 
diseases will be dealt with as groups and 
others will be discussed on an individual 
basis Available space does not allow ex 
tensive discussion of the diseases or of all 
the diagnostic techniques beyond what has

Arthrolmd borne (Arbor) Vinues 

The arthropod borne (Arbor) viruses 
consutute a rather large group, which pro 
duce diseases in mammals and birds (ver 
tebrates) and which multiply in the bodies 
of arthropods Tlieir transmission from 
vertebrate to vertebrate depends on the 
arthropod host in which the \ irus although 
It multiplies does not produce disease

garduig these ^genls is fragmentary es 
pecially regarding their geographic disin 
button 

Some of the Arbor viruses are related 
clinically and antigenically and they have 
been divided into groups mostly on sero 
logic grounds The best known viruses are 
found in Groups A and B Group C con 
taimng only a few agents Se\eral others 
are as yet ungrouped In Table 19 1 are 
shown some of the important charactens 
lies of what are at the moment the most 
important Arbor viruses 

Rabtes 

Rabies is one of the most important dis 
eases of animals that is transmissible to 
man All mammals are susceptible to the 
infection which is universally fatal once 
symptoms have appeared It is primarily a 
disease of canines being maintained in 
dogs foxes and wolves but also occurs 
frequently in skunks and less frequently in 
squirrels and other rodents In Central 
America it is present in vampire bats 
which transmit it to domestic ammals and 
man In the vampire bat the disease may 
be chronic and unapparent for a consider 
able time Recently it has been found that 
rabies exists in insectivorous bats m widely 
scattered regions in the United States 

The virus is present in the saliva in 
fected animals and m the canine appears 
at this site two or three days before symp 
toms appear Infection occurs by introduc 
tion of the virus into tissue usually as the 
result of biting It may also be introduced 
if saliva comes in contact with a fresh cut 
or abrasion that has broken the continuity 
of the skin Any animal bite especially of a 
dog fox skunk squirrel or bat must be 
viewed with suspicion and every attempt 
made to ascertain whether the biting ant 
mal had rabies The incubation period of 
rabies in humans vanes from approxi 
mately two weeks to several months there 
being some reports of incubation periods as 
long as two years The incubation penod 
depends on the severity of the bite and the 
location Severe bites about the head and 
neck tend to have the shortest incubation 
period while those on the extremities have 
the longest It is imperative that all ex 
posed individuals have proper treatment 
(Pasteur vaccine or hyperimmune serum) 
started at the earliest possible lime but 
since the treatment itself is somewhat 
hazardous it Is of the utmost Importance to 
determine whether the biting animal had 
rabies 


785 

The diagnosis of rabies depends on a 
history of exposure the clinical symptoms 
which arc the least dependable criteria 
isolation of varus by intracerebral inocula 
tion of mice and demonstration of the 
characteristic Negri bodies in the brain 
which if properly done is accurate and 
rapid A positive finding is diagnostic but 
failure to find Negri bodies does not rule out 
infection especially when the brain is de 
composing otving to poor handbng or when 
the animal has been sacrificed early in the 
disease Thus- it is well to do mouse brain 
inoculation with suspensions of salivary 
tissue or brain 

In all cases of animal bite all possible 
means of locating the animal should be 
tried It should be captured alive if at all 
possible and observed for clinical evidence 
of disease In most places the law requires 
that dogs sho ving no symptoms be im 
pounded for 10 to 14 days Care must be 
used when killing animals to avoid damage 
to the brain The head should be removed 
with a knife and chilled but not frozen 
It should be taken to the laboratory and 
examined immediately If shipment is re 
quired it must be packed in ice (not dry 
ice) since the brain tissue degenerates 
very rapidly if not cold making microscopic 
examination difficult if not impossible 

Kcniovol of the Brain The brain is re 
moved Intact by opening the cramal cavity 
With a saw bone chisel or other suitable 
implement The operator should use heavy 
rubber gloves and be very careful to avoid 
exposure to the virus After removal the 
brain is placed upright on a piece of filter 
paper in a dish 

FrcpTraiion of Slides Negri bodies are 
most frequently found in the stellate cells 
of the Ammons horn (hippocampus) but 
may also occur in the cerebellum and cere 
brum Thus stained smears should be 
made and examined from all three sites 
Ammons horn is exposed by cutting 
through the cerebral cortex into the lateral 
ventricle of the brain making a longi 
tuduial Incision into the dorsal surface of 
each cerebral hemisphere VVhen the sides 
of the incision are spread apart Ammons 
horn can be seen as a semJcyllndrJcaJ 
white glistening body bulging laterally 
from the floor of the ventricle 

With a small scissors remove small 
transverse sections of both Ammons horns 
and place them cut surface up on an ap- 
plicator Slick Do tiie same witli the cere 
belluin and ccrcb um Impression slides 
are then made by toucliing a clem slide to 
the cut surfaces Touch the sHdv to the

tissue ■with just enough pressure to spread 
a slight amount of it on the slide Impres 
Sion slides are better than smears because 
they contam a maximum amount of nene 
tissue m a mimmum area 

Staining Procedure While the smear is 
still moist flood the shde nith Sellers stain 
or dip It quickly into a Coplm jar filled -with 
this stain This stam fixes and stains simul 
taneously and is % ery dependable Rinse the

In the stained smear the Negn body is 
an aadophilic structure of ^ aryang size and 
shape that stains magenta to heliotrope in 
color (Fig 19-3) It \anes from 2 to 10 fi 
In size and contains one to four basophibc 
granules which stam dark blue or black 
The Negn hody forms within the cell and 
IS characteristically seen m the cytoplasm 
but It may appear outside the cell if the 
cell IS ruptured Thus the findmg of typical 
Negn bodies is diagnostic yyhether they are 
inside or outside the cell 

Other types of inclusions that may be 
seen need to be differentiated from Negn 
bodies In the brains of dogs and foxes the 
acidophilic mclusions of carune distemper 
or hepatitis may be seen There are similar 
structures in the brams of mice cats 
skunks woodchucks raccoons and squir 
rels These structures stam pink to bngbt 
red tend to be round and are more re 
fractile than Negn bodies They do not 
have internal granules and may be dif 
ferenuated on these grounds 

Inoculation of Animals The mouse is 
the animal of choice for moculauon in

cases of rabies Intracerebral moculauon 
of 0 01 to 0 03 ml of a 10 per cent sus 
pension of central nenous system tissue 
or salivary gland mto five or slx mice is to 
be recommended in all cases of suspected 
rabies The diluent for these tissue suspen 
sions should be buffered saline pH 7 6 to 
7 8 although 0 85 per cent salme may be 
used PeniciUm (1000 units per ml ) and 
streptomjcm (2 mg per ml ) should be 
added to the tissue suspension which is 
allowed to stand 30 minutes before use 
Tissue should be taken from several parts 
of the brain and pooled since virus distri 
button vanes If tissues are to be collected 
for shipment to another laboratory or for 
storage they should be placed in 50 per 
cent glycerin saline or frozen m a drj ice 
box The suspension of tissue should be 
centnfuged at 1000 rpm for five minutes 
or allowed to settle m a refngerator for 
several hours before use 

Inoculated mice should be checked dail) 
for at least three weeks and the mice 
should be held for at least 30 days Any 
deaths occumng within the fi st 48 hours 
are to be attnbuted to some other cause 
Seldom do symptoms of rabies occur in 
less than five days After five days mice

many years largely a climcal one although 
certain laboratory procedures (spinal fluid 
examination) were of some help It was 
especially difficult to diagnose the non

mg epidemic penods were probably over 
diagnosed The usual diagnostic procedures

and maintsim Neutralization tests bad to 
be done using groups of monkeys and quite 
obviously could not be done routinely 
Proper antigens were difficult if not un 
possible to prepare for the complement 
fixation test 

Some years ago the Type 11 (Lansing) 
polio virus was adapted to mice and later 
Type I (Mahoney) and Type III (Leon) 
were also adapted to mice by special metb 
ods Using these mouse adapted strains it 
IS possible to do neutralization tests on 
paired serums 

The demonstrauon that poho\irus can 
be propagated in ussue culture ivith non 
neural tissues (monkey kidney and testicle 
and human foreskin) led within a short 
time to the de\elopment of methods that 
have made possible extensne epidemiologic 
and diagnostic studies Tliese ha\e resulted 
m much better understandmg of the dis 
ease impro\ement in diagnosis and the 
development of a vaceme It is now pos 
sible to do virus isolations from naso- 
pharyngeal washings or feces directly into 
tissue culture Neutralization tests on 
paired serums can also be done using tissue 
culture mstead of animals and antigens for 
complement fixation can be made from 
tissue culture Thus any laboratory that is 
equipped to do tissue culture can do diag 
nostic pohovirus isolation and neutraliza 
tion Other laboratones may obtain anu 
gens for complement fixation tests on 
paired serums 

There are three antigenically distmct 
types of poliovirus of which the accepted 
prototypes are Mahoney (Type I) Lansing 
(Type II) and Leon (Type III) Recovery 
from mfection with one type confers long 


term immunity to reinfection with that 
type but not to the other two Neutraliza 
non tests do not show cross reactions be- 
tween the types but the complement fixa 
tion tests on human convalescent serums 
have revealed certain group antigens 

The immediate diagnosis of poliomyebtis 
IS stiU largely based on clinical signs and 
spinal fluid findings and in the paralytic 
form this is not too difficult However in 
nonparalytic disease it is difficult since 
several other agents that cause aseptic 
meningitis are clinically similar and m 
distinguishable from pohomyehus The 
most common viruses involved are mumps 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis ECHO her 
pes simplex herpes zoster epidemic en 
cephalitis and Coxsackie Group B (some 
types) Some cases of “aseptic meningitis” 
in vvhich Leptospira are involved have been 
described Tuberculous and other bacterial 
memngitides may be difficult to dif 
ferentiate climcally from those caused by 
virus Laboratory assistance is thus neces 
sary in these conditions 

The Coxsackie I inner 

The first str ains of Coxsackie viruses 
were isolated from the stools of patients 
with paralytic poliomyelitis It was later 
found that these viruses do not produce 
paralytic disease but certain strams do 
produce aseptic menmgins This was the 
first of a large group of enteroviruses 
which are now divided into the Coxsackie 
(Groups A and B) and the ECHO viruses 
New members of the group are still being 
Jound and the classification is not yet com 
plete Some types in all groups have not 



Viral and RicacErrsiAL Diseases 


)et been associated with definite disease 
entities 

Certain tj^ies (1-5) of Group B Cox- 
sachie \iruses have been shoun to be as 
sociated with cases of aseptic meningitis 
These tend to occur seasonally in the sum 
mer and fall There is also evidence that 
some strains of Group A are associated 
with this disease 

Two other disease entities are associated 
with the Coxsackie viruses Members of 
Group A, types 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. have 
been found to cause herpangina, which af- 
fects mainly children Group B Coxsackie 


789 

viruses are associated with epidemic myal 
gia or pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) 

The diagnosis of Coxsackie infection can 
be established b> virus isolation or by 
serologic means The virus is present in the 
digestive tract and can be isolated from 
feces, nasopharyngeal vvashmgs, or swabs 
by inoculation into suckling mice (one day 
old) or into tissue culture, although tissue 
culture IS much less efficient with Group A 
viruses (Figs 19-5. 19-6) Adult mice and 
other animals are resistant to the virus

T/ie ECHO Vtnts Group 

The ECHO (enteric cyiopathogemc 
human orphan) \iruscs arc a newly rccog 
nized group of agents that infect the human 
intestinal tract They can be isolated in cer 
tain tissue cultures Numerous antigenic 
types have been identified and some have 
been shown to be associated with aseptic 
meningitis febrile Illnesses and diarrheal 
diseases in infants and children during the 
summer months Since this is a new group 
It is to be expected that further types will 
be described Much further study of these 
agents wili be necessary to elucidate their 
full potential 

Melnick (1955) and Sabin (1959) have 
pointed out that there are no clcarcut elm 
leal indications of ECHO virus infection 
but certain epidemic situations during the 
summer and autumn may be suggestive 

1 A high incidence of the aseptic mcnm 
gltls syndrome with few or no paralytic 
cases 

2 Outbreaks of febrile illness associated 
with a high Incidence of rash cspccfall) in 
younger children with or without a con 
comitant increase In the number of cases 
of aseptic meningitis 

3 Outbreaks of diarrheal disease cspc 
cially in very young infants from which 
few if any of the established enteropatho- 
genic bacteria can be recovered 


The diagnosis of ECHO virus Infection 
depends on isolation of the virus Such 
isolation can be made from feces throat 
swabs and spinal fluid by inoculation into 
tissue culture (Fig 19-7) Rectal swabs 
may also be used The tissue culture of 
choice IS the one containing the kidney of 
rhesus or cynomolgus monkeys Other types 
of tissue culture have been used No uni 
versally useful animal has yet been found 
although some of the virus stains produce 
disease in suckling mice 

Serologic tests so far have been useful 
in identification of Isolated ECHO viruses 
but are not applicable to the diagnosis of 
(he disease m patients 

Lymphocytic r/iorio»irm»gi(iJ 

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is prlma 
rliy a disease of animals that occasionally 
infects man producing aseptic meningitis 
The spinal fluid tends to have a high 
lymphocyte count but the disease cannot 
be differentiated from other forms of asep- 
tic meningitis The virus can be isolated 
from spinal fluid blood and central nerv 
ous system tissue and the mouse and 
guinea pig are the animals of choice One 
must be certain that the stock animals arc 
free of the virus Ncutrali/ation and com

abortive measles The diagnosis tends to be 
largely clinical unless one suspects in 
fiuenza, ARD. or atypical pneumoma in 
which case there are specific laboratory 
procedures that may be used (see Table 
19-4) 

Influenza Influenza is caused by a virus 
of which four distinct antigenic types. A, 
B, C. and D have been demonstrated The 
antigenic composition varies from time to 
time Variants of types A and B have been 
found in epidemics penodically over the 
past few years Influenza is character 
istically a mild disease most deaths result* 
ing from complicating pneumonias 

Laboratory confirmation of a clinical 
diagnosis of influenza may be made by iso 
lation of a virus from throat washings of 
the acutely ill patient and inoculation into 
the amniotic sac of a 10 to 14 day em 
bryonated chick embryo Serologic tests 
may be done on paired serums hemagglu- 
tinin inhibition being most commonly em 
ployed This test is not strictly strain 
specific Complement fixation using soluble 
antigens is considered strain specific 

Vnirnry Atypical Pneumonn The eti- 
ology of primary atypical pneumoma has 
not yet been clearly defined The diagnosis 
depends on a thorough study of the patient 
to rule out the presence of other acute 
respiratory disease 

There are two nonspecific serologic tests 
that may be of assistance First it has been 
shown that some patients develop agglu 
unating antibodies against Streptococcus 
MG Second there may be increases in cold 
agglutinins for human crytlirocytes, in 
eluding those of group O A fourfold or 
greater increase in agglutinins for Strepto 
coccus MG ct vn cold agglutwvKvs caw be 
considered suggestive but negative findings 
do not exclude the disease 

The Adcnosiruv Croup The adeno- 
viruses were first isolated from tissue cul 
ture of human adenoid tissue Prolonged 
incubation of the culture resulted in the 
appearance of changes m the epithelial bke

Psittacosis, Lymlthogramihma Venereum, 
and Cat Scratch Feier 

Psittacosis 

The psittacosis virus is one of a large 
group of viruses that are primarily patho- 
gens of birds and mammals Psittacosis 
Itself, a pathogen of psittacine birds Is 
transmissible to man through contact with 
the infected bird It is closely related if not 
identical, to the virus of ornithosis found 
in nonpslltacine birds such as pigeons, 
ducks, turkeys, and canancs These viruses 
in turn, are related to the pneumonitis 
viruses of several mammalian species (Figs 
19-8 to 19-10) A number of these latter 
agents appear capable of producing disease 
in man. although few proved instances have 
been reported 

Psittacosis in man usually results from 
contact with a parakeet, although other 
psiitacines may be involved Outbreaks of 
human ornithosis hive occurred in workers 
on duck or turkey farms, and m this regard 
it is an occupational disease 

The psittacosls-omlthosis lymphogranu 
loma group of viruses are the largest of the 
viruses and in size are Intermediate be 
tween the viruses and rickottsiae Their 
classification as viruses hinges on their in 
traccllular multiplication They are closely 
related anugenically through group anti 
gens 

Psittacosis was originally viewed as an 
acute, se\etc, often fatal pneunvonvRs, but 
more recently it has been recognized that 
it is more often a subclinical disca«;c rc 
scmbling an atypical common cold Thus, 
the disease has a variable course Tlic incu 
bation period is 7 to 25 days Tlie onset is 
vague It is followed by the acute stage 
with general malaise, coughing, fever, 
chills vomiting, and headache which may 
be severe Restlessness, Insomnia, dchrlum 
and a lypholdal state with nonproductive 
cough and constipation may develop

tious and consequently \ery dangerous to 
handle numerous laboratory infections 
have occurred 

Serologic Tests The serologic test of 
choice in psittacosis is complement fixation 
Antigens for such tests are available com 
mercially They are usually prepared from 
the yolk sac oi iniected chick embryos and 
contain the heat stable common group anti 
gens for members of the psittacosiSH3mi 
thosis lymphogranuloma viruses The yolk 
sac antigen is now accepted as standard 
The strain specific antigens are destroyed 
by heating or by the addition of phenol in 
the preparation of the antigen It is neces 
sary to test simultaneously paired acute 
and convalescent serums from the patient 
since results on single serum samples can 
not be considered definitive A rise m titer 
between collection of the acute and con 
valescent serums is indicative of infection 
with a member of the group To establish 
the specific strain involved m the infec 
non one can absorb the serum with the 
group antigen and then run the comple 
meni fixation test using specific antigens 

Virus Isolation For virus isolation sev 
eral materials are needed Blood should be 
collected during the first week of illness 
before treatment or during a relapse The 
whole defibrinated or clotted blood but 
not the serum should be frozen as soon as 
possible after collection Sputum should be 
collected if possible it should also be 
frozen as soon as possible Pleural fluid 
may be collected and frozen Vomitus may 
also be taken and frozen Throat washings 
may be collected as in infiuenza At au 
topsy tissue may be taken from the part of 
the lung affected by pneumoma or from a 
piece of spleen or liver and pleural or other 
effusions may be collected The pieces of 
tissue should be frozen if not used within 
five hours It should be reemphasized that 
these materials must be handled with ex 
treme caution 

Mice may be inoculated intranasally un 
der light anesthesia or intrapentoneally 
The material (tissue suspensions and similar 
material) properly treated with antibiotics 
may be inoculated into the yolk sac or 
dropped onto the chonoillantoic membrane 
of six to seven-day-old chick embryos 

In the infected ammal or chick embryo 
the virus may be demonstrated In tissue 
smears or sections stained by Castaneda 
Macchiavello or Giemsa stain The virus 
particles are large (0 280 to 0 380 fi and 
bacteria like They arc found primarily in 
the reuculoendothellal cells and may appear 


as packets staining purple with Giemsa 
red with Macchiavello or deep blue with 
Castaneda stain The Frei test extensively 
used as an aid in the diagnosis of lympho- 
granuloma venereum may occasionally be 
positive 

Lvmvuogr.?.>i\ji.oma Vene.re.wm 
Lymphogranuloma venereum is a vene 
real disease caused by a virus closely re 
lated antigenically and biologically to the 
psittacosis-ornithosis viruses The charac 
tenstic lesion is the enlarged inguinal 
lymph node which progresses to abscess 
formation Tissue sections of the nodes re 
veal areas of inflammation small foci of 
epithelioid cells and some giant cells 
Within the epithelioid monocytes there 
tend to be characteristic inclusions contain 
ing elementary bodies that stain In the 
same manner as the similar bodies found 
in psittacosis 

The varus may be isolated from bubo pus 
tissue biopsy specimens or spinal fluid For 
shipment the collected material must be 
carefully packed In tightly scaled tubes 
and should not be frozen unless it is ccr 
tain to be maintained in the frozen state 
until used For isolation one may use young 
Swiss albino mice which are most sus 
ccptible although most laboratory mice 
may be used The material should be Jnocu 
lated mtracerebrally and it may be neces 
sary to make several "blind” transfers at 
ten day intervals before the mice show 
symptoms The matcnal may also be inocu 
lated into the yolk sac of six-day em 
bryonated eggs Demonstration of virus in 
the infected animal or chick embryo is 
similar to that for the psittacosis virus 

There are two immunologic aids in the 
diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum 
The first is the Frei test a skin test using 
an antigen prepared from heavily infected 
yolk sac suspensions A positive skin test 
with this antigen is highly suggestive a! 
though there arc cross reactions with the 
psittacosis ornithosis viruses (sec Chapter 
20) The second immunologic test is com 
plement fixation which should be run on 
paired scrums The antibody response in 
patients who receive early •mublotlc ther 
apy may be minimal or delayed and this 
must be kept in mind in interpreting the 
results of complement fixation tests 
Cat Scratch Disease

dividuals who ha\e been scratched b> a cat 
It is characterized by fever malaise and 
lymphadenitis which may be preceded by 
a cutaneous lesion Rarely the disea^ 
progresses to encephalitis Although the 
causative agent has not been definitely iso 
lated and characterized it has been sug 
gesied that it is related to the virus of 
lymphogranuloma venereum Actually one 
may find positive complement fixation tests 
in patients with cat scratch disease when 
their serums are tested with lymphogranu 
Joma antigen The results of such tests 
must be interpreted with caution since 
such positive findings may have resulted 
from previous infection with the lympho 
granuloma virus 

A skin test has been used as an aid in 
the diagnosis of cat scratch fever The anti 
gen IS prepared from human material and 
IS not available commercially 

Trachoma and Inceosion Ble^worrhea 

Trachoma and mclusion blennorrhea are 
caused by viruses of the psittacosis lympho 


granuloma group Both are characterized 
by the presence of typical mclusion bodies 
in cells in the epithelium Trachoma is the 
more ^nous disease having a worldwide 
distribution and tending to produce serious 
lesions in the eyes of infected mdividuals 
This infection appears to be limited to the 
eye Inclusion blennorrhea is a much milder 
condition than trachoma and is not world 
\/ide in distribution It is responsible for 
a bemgn form of conjunctivitis m the new 
bom that usually begins 5 to 11 days after 
birth There may be a great deal of infiam 
mation and exudate In the adult the dis 
ease is an acute follicular conjunctivitis 
usually without the abundant exudate This 
virus may also produce a mild urethritis in 
adults 

Trachoma also differs from inclusion 
blennorrhea m that in trachoma there may 
be considerable secondary bacterial mfec 
tion and bacteriologic study of the abun 
dant exudate may be important 

Neither the virus of trachoma nor that 
of inclusion blennorrhea has as yet been

Smallpox 

Smallpox (\anala) has become a rare 
disease m areas where vaccmation is done 
to a sufBcient extent but it still exists in 
Its most virulent form in certain parts of 
the world especially m the Far East As 
long as the disease exists anywhere there 
IS the danger that dunng the incubation 
period a person with the disease will be 
transported to an area such as the United 
States where the disease has not been seen 
for a number of ^ears 

^Vhen It occurs smallpox must be dif 
ferentiated from vancella (chickenpox) In 


both diseases the first skin lesions are 
papules which progress to vesicles and 
then to pustules In smallpox the lesions 
develop simultaneously while in varicella 
they tend to appear m vanous stages 
The laboratory diagnosis of smallpox de 
pends upon demonstration of typical in 
elusions in the cytoplasm of cells in stained 
smears from the pustules (Fig 19-13) and 
on isolation of virus from blood or pustular 
fluid by inoculation onto the chorioallantoic 
membrane of embryonated eggs (10 to 13 
days) Laboratory diagnosis Sso depends 
on complement fixation or hemagglutmin 
inhibition tests on paired serums from the 
patient and on use of the Paul test in which 
pustular matenal is inoculated on the scari 
fled cornea of the rabbit 

Vaccinia 

Generalized vaccinia sometimes occurs 
following vaccination for smallpox The 
laboratory diagnosis can be made in a man 
ner similar to that for smallpox

the virus „may produce recurrent herpes 
simplex, which' may affect any skin area 
but most frequently occurs at mucocu- 
taneous junctions (cold sores); ecremaher- 
peticum, which, as the name implies, tends 
to occur in indi\iduals tvith eczema; or 
traumatic herpes, which may occur at the 
site of bums or other trauma. On the mu- 
cous membranes the virus may -produce 
acute infectious gingivostomatitis, which 
is probably the most common primary form 
of herpes infection, it is the most common 
form of stomatitis between the ages of one 
and three years but may occur in all age 
groups (Fig. 19-16). The virus may also 
cause keratoconjunctivitis, which may be 
p rim ary or recurrent; vailvovaginitis, which 
also may be primary or recurrent; and her- 
pes piogenit^s, which is usually recurrent 
on the glans or shaft of the penis. In the 
central ner\’ous system the virus may cause 



Figure 19-16 Herpetic stomatitis. (T. F. McNair 
Scott In Nelson, Textbook of Pediatrics, 7tli ed.) 


meningoencephalitis, and occasionally the 
primary infection may be a generalized 
systemic- disease. In neivbom infants there 
may be a fulminant visceral condition. 
Certain forms of herpes simplex infection 
must be differentiated from smallpox, vari- 
cella, herpes zoster, and Coxsackie (Group 
A) infection (herpangina). 

The laboratory diagnosis depends on 
demonstration of typical intranuclear in- 
clusion bodies (Cowdry, Type A) in stained 
smears from the lesions or in tissue sec- 
tions (Fig. 19-17), on isolation of virus 
from tissue or vesicle fluid by inoculation 
into chick embryos or certain laboratory 
animals (mice, rabbits, guinea pigs), and 
on serologic tests on paired serums (neu- 
tralization or complement fixation). 

The inclusion body of herpes simplex oc- 
curs in all types of infected tissues. \Vhen 
fully developed, it is an acidophilic mass 
drawn away from the edge of the nucleus 
with the appearance of having a halo 
around it. In the early stages of develop- 
ment the inclusion fills the nucleus and 
stains faintly basophilic. In epithelial le- 
sions “ballooning cells” are present in the 
smears and sections. 

Virus isolation may be made from vesicle 
fluid in the superficial lesions of the skin or 
mucous membranes, from saliva, spinal 
fluid, or clotted blood (from the clol)i or 
from central nervous system tissue in fatal 
cases. 

Chick embryos (12 to 13 days) are 
inoculated on the chorioallantoic mem- 
brane where the virus produces pock-hXe 
lesions. Adult mice may be inoculated in- 
tracerebrally, or sucklmg mice, which are

cations may develop in the form of or

s frequent lesions such as pancreatitis

Laboratory aids in the diagnosis of 
imps are isolation of the virus in chick 
brjos and serologic tests (complement 
ation and agglutinin inhibition) 

Virus may be isolated from saliva on the 
it and second days of parotitis and from

Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease (Sain ary 
Gland Virus Infection) 

A generalized disease charactenzed by 
the presence of intranuclear and intra 
cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the cells 
of several organs is occasionally encoun 
tered In infants it is generally fatal In 
older children and adults the chnicnl pic 
tore vanes depending on the organs in 
vohod Diagnosis can be made by the com 
plement fixation and neutrahzation tests 
and by the demonstration of the typical in 
elusion bodies in scrapings from 'the mouth 
and in urine (Birdsong et al , 1956 Rowe 
et al , 1958) 

RICKETTSIAE 

There are a number of nckettsial dis 
eases of man of which the best knoivn are 
typhus and the spotted fe%ers All these 
diseases with one exception are carried by 
arthropod sectors and most are trans 
mitted to man by the bite or the feces of 
the infected arthropod In Table 19-5 the 
various nckettsial diseases are shoivn with 
their dislnbution and mode of transmis 
Sion 

The diagnosis of the nckettsial diseases 
depends on chnical epidemiologic and lab 
orator) findings Laboratory procedures of 
assistance are isolation of the nckettsiae 
in guinea pigs or mice and observation of 
the animals especially guinea pigs for cer 
tain typical reactions ivhich vary with the 
different agents and serologic tests on

During the first week of the disease 
nckettsiae may be Isolated by inoculation of 
fresh or frozen whole blood intraperitone- 


ally into mice or guinea pigs. Later in the 
disease the cellular elements should be se^ 
aratcd from the serum or plasma by centri- 
fugation or clotting. The cells or the 
ground-up clot should then be used for ani-

the diagnosis of nchcttsial diseases is the 
U eil Felix reaction This is based on the 
observation that patients with certain of 
these infections (t^^ihus and spotted fe\er) 
de%elop antibodies that react with certain 
nonmotile strains of bacteria belonging to 
the genus ProtCHS (Profews OXi, OX and 
OXk) Although this is a nonspecific test 
it is useful since it is a simple agglutma 
tion test done on paired scrums and the 
antibod) nse occurs fairly early (late m the 
second week) (See section on serologic 
methods p 889 ) 

Patients treated with antibiotics early in 
the disease may base delayed antibody 
responses sometimes as lite as four to six 
weeks after the onset of symptoms This 
should be remembered in evaluating the 
results of serologic tests especially the 
complement fixation and agglutination re- 
actions

Vaccines and Diagnostic 
Skin Tests 

JAMES G SHAFEER Sc D /»»/ MILTON GOLDIN MS 


The use of \accines of %anous types in the 
control of infectious diseases is well known 
(smallpox tj^ihoid feNer and diphtheria 
for example) In this chapter only one t>pe 
of \accine will be discussed This is the 
autogenous vacune which has from lime 
to time been used uidely in individuals 
with boils carbuncles and impetigo 

There are several varieties of this \ac 
cine 

1 Autogenous vaccine— suspension of 
the organism isolated from the lesion pre 
pared as described in this chapter 

2 Mixed autogenous vaccine — a suspen 
sion prepared from a variety of organisms 
isolated from an area such as the naso 
pharynx or from sputum 

3 Stock vaccine — a vaccine ( 'bactenn'’) 
prepared cominercially from a presumably 
representatue stram or group of strains of 
bacteria 

4 Filtrates — soluble products of organ 
isms that ha\e grown in broth This is 
sometimes mixed with the ^accIne as a 
“vaccine filtrate 

5 Toxoid — toxins converted to nontoxic 
but antigemc sui-stances by heat or chemi 
cals (formalin) 

The special value of autogenous vac 
cines would appear to be in the treatment 
of subacute or chronic localized infections 
In these conditions circulation of blood and 
lymph IS poor and chemotherapeutic 
agents may be relatuely ineffective since 
they cannot readily reach tue infected area 
On the other hand chemotherap) may be 


effective in the treatment of boils and car 
buncies only to have the lesions recur on 
cessation of treatment Vaccines and tox 
Olds are frequently given for prophylaxis in 
such conditions They are of little or no 
value in acute infections and may be con 
tramdicated 

Best results are obtained m situations in 
which staphylococci are mvohed Success 
ful results have however been claimed m 
such diverse conditions as nonspecific 
urethntis chronic bronchitis bronchial 
asthma smus infections chrome upper 
respiratory infections and pustular acne 
In such condiuons one may wonder whether 
or not desensitization may be the primary 
factor 

The value of vacemes for the treatment 
of chronic or recurrent infecuons has long 
been a controversial question Evaluation 
of results is difficult and one can never be 
certain that beneficial results are due to the 
vaccine At any rate the preparation of an 
autogenous vaccine on request is an im 
portant part of the work of the bacteriology 
laboratory and in spite of the ever mcreas 
ing use of potent chemotherapeutic sub- 
stances their use seems to be increasmg

to avoid contamination with other organ 
isms especially spore forming bacilh some 
of which produce powerful soluble toxins 

Examine a gram stain from the infected 
area to determine Uie type of organism 
present Culture on plates of blood agar in 
infusion broth and in or upon other suit 
able media Examme the plates for pre 
dommating colomes and make gram stains 
of each type and from the broth culture 
If organisms different from those isolated 
on the primary plates are seen in the broth 
culture, subculture to plates of suitable 
media 

Select isolated colonies of the type de 
sired and examine carefully Re streak to a 
fresh agar plate to isolate the organisms in 
pure culture Select a smooth colony and 
transfer to the desired media for prepara 
tion of the vaccme 

Preparation of the Sttspenston 

There are many methods of preparing 
the suspension ^ are satisfactory, pro- 
vided a representative bacterial suspension 
IS obtained that can be admimstered safely 
to the patient Regardless of the technique 
used, the following precautions must be 
observed 

1 Avoid the use of any media contam 
mg blood serum body fluids or similar 
potentially antigenic materials 

2 All manipulations involved in the 
preparation of the suspension must be car 
ned out with strict precautions to avoid 
contamination 

3 Filter the suspension to remove par 
tides of culture media and clumps of bac 
tena that may clog the hypodermic needle 
or produce an untoward reaction in the 
patient 

4 The final product must be standard 
ized to the proper density (Fig 20-1) 

5 The vaccine must be treated by heat 
or chemicals in such a way as to effecmely 
kill the bacteria without denaturation of 
the antigenic material 

6 The stenhty (freedom from viable 
bacteria) of the vaccine must be assured

Procedure I Grow the organisms on 
agar slants Add 2 or 3 ml of sterile saline 
to 24 or 48 hour cultures and bring the 
growth into suspension by emulsifying with 
a wire loop and shaking Filter the sus 
pension through stenle cotton or glass wool 
into a vaccine bottle containing glass beads 
(Fig 20-2) Shake the vaccine bottle vig 
orously The suspension is then ready to 
be standardized 

This procedure is satisfactory for rapidly 
growing organisms such as staphylococci 
but is not suitable for mixed vaccines or 
those made from fastidious organisms In 
these cases broth cultures are preferable 

Procedure JI (Kolmer’s [1951] Method) 
Grow the organism in pure culture in a 
large flask of broth overnight at 37® C The 
concentration of bacteria is calculated by 
the counting chamber or Wrights method 
(sec next section) Calculate the volume 
of suspension required to make 20 ml of 
a vacane containmg 1000 million organ 
jsms per ml 

Millions of organism desired per ml ^ 
Milbons of organism present per ml 
ml of suspension to be diluted to 20 ml 

For example suppose the suspension 
count totals 4600 million per ml Then 

= ‘^ 3 nil of suspension to use 

In a stenle vial containing glass beads 
place 4 3 ml of the suspension 1 6 ml 
of 5 per cent phenol and 14 I ml of sterile 
saline Tncresol (0 25 per cent) or Merthi 
olate (I JOOO) may be used instead of 
phenol Shake the suspension well In 
cubate at 37® C overnight and check for 
sterility

Wrights Method 

Prepare a Wnghts capillary pipet with 
a capillary 5 to 6 inches long (Fig 20-3) 
Make a mark on the stem of the capillary 
about 1 inch from the tip Cleanse and 
prick the finger Do an erythrocyte count 
Compress the bulb of the Wnghts pipet 
and draw 3 per cent sodium citrate solu 
tion up to the mark Allow a little air to 
enter the capillary Draw blood from the 
finger exactly to the mark Then allow a 
hitle more air to enter and finally draw 
the well mixed vaccine to the mark Expel 
the contents of the pipet onto a watch glass 
and mix thoroughly by aspirating and ex 
pelling from the pipet about ten tunes 
Prepare three or four thin films on clean 
glass slides 

Dry the films and fix m a saturated solu 
tion of mercunc chloride Wash mth water 
and stain for three to fi\e minutes wth a 
1 10 dilution of carbol fuchsm or carbol 
thioiun blue Wash with water and allow 
to dry Examine the films There should be 
an even distribution of erythrocytes and 
bacteria VMth no clumps of the latter Un 
der the oil immersion lens count the nuni 
her of erythrocytes and the number of 
bactena in a number of fields until 500 or 
more erythrocytes hate been counted 
•V Record the number of erythrocytes and the 
number of bacteria counted 

Calculate as shown at bottom of page 

Counting Chamber Method 

1 In a small stenle test tube place 0 I 
ml of the suspension and 4 9 ml sahne 
(1 50 dilution) Mix well Draw to the 0 5 
mark m a white blood cell counting pipet 
Draw freshly filtered staining solution* to 
the H mark 

2 Shake for two to three minutes dis 
card the first few drops and place a drop 
of the suspension on the counting chamber 
Allow It to settle for about 15 Tiunutes

Nephelometric Method (McFarland) 

This method consists of comparing the 
opacity of the \accine with a senes of ten 
standard nephelometer tubes It is satisfac 
torv for suspensions that are not colored 

Standards Set up ten uniform clean test 
tubes of hard glass (screw caps are recom 
mended) Add to each tube as follows

The tubes are hermetically sealed and 
labeled 1 to 10 

Procedure One milhhter of the well 
mixed bacterial suspension is placed in a 
tube of the same diameter as the nephel 
oraeter standard A measured amount of 
saline is then added slowly rvilh constant 
shaking until the density of the diluted 
\accine matches that of the desired stand 
ard tube 

Calculation The number of bacteria in 
1 ml of \accme = the number of the cor 
respondmg nephelometer tube x the dilu 
tion For example 1 ml is diluted to 5 
ml to match tube No 3 It therefore con 
tains approximately 900 miUion X 5 or 
4500 million bactena per ml

calculation Is then as follows

Sterilization of the T acctne 

The \accine is sterilized by either heat 
or chemicals Heating is done in the water 
bath making sure that the entire sus 
pension is immersed in the water for one 
hour at 60® C Tricresol (0 25 per cent) or 
phenol (0 5 per cent) should be added as 
preservatne Merthiolate at a concentration 
of 1 1000 may also be used Check for 
stenlit> 

For chemical sterihzation place the de 
sired quantity of the standardized raceme 
suspension m a sterile raceme bottle and 
add tncresol to a final concentration of 0 5 
per cent One milliliter of a 5 per cent solu 
tion IS used for each 1 0 ml of r accine Seal 
the rial with a vaccine stopper mix thor 
oughly and incubate at 37® C for 48 
hours shaking at intervals Check for stei 
ibty as descnbed m the next section 

Testing for Sterility Check the final rac 
cine by cultunng at least 0 2d ml from 
each Mai in thioglycoUate broth or other 
suitable media depending on the type of 
organism from which the vaccine tras 
originally prepared Incubate at 37® C for 
at least six to eight days If stenlc the 
vaccine can (hen be released 

If growth occurs of the same type of 
orgamsm from which the vaccine was pre 
pared it is permissible to reheat the sus 
pension for one hour at 60® C If a different 
organism is grown the \ accine should be 
discarded and a new one prepared For this 
reason it is necessary to sa\e all the ongmal 
isolations in the refngerator until the \ac 
cine is ready to be released The label of 
the vaceme should show the type of or 
ganism it contams the concentration the 
name of the patient and the date 

PREP\IUVTJON or MIXED \ VCCINES 

The process is essentially the same as 
for autogenous vaccines made from a sin 
gle organism Use of the so<alIed "shotgun” 
vaccines prepared by simply drawing a loop 
across the culture plate or the har^cst of 
mixed flora growing on an agar slam is 
not recommended By these crude pro-

cedures the representative flora from the 
involved area may not be obtained It is 
more likely that large numbers of rapidly 
growing organisms that may be sapro- 
phytes would be present The vaccine con 
sequently would probably be worthless 
Each organism that is to be included in 
a mixed vaccine must be picked from a 
single colony mto individual tubes of In 
fusion broth Normal inhabitants of the 
mucous membranes or skin, such as co- 
agulase negative staphylococci, diphthe 
roids, or Neisserw catarrhahs, should not be 
included The growth from each tube is 
standardized and pooled as for an au 
togenous vaceme 

PREPAILVTION OF FILTILVTES 

Some authors beheve that a vaceme con 
taming the soluble toxms and metabohtes 
of the growmg bacteria is superior to the 
usual type 
To prepare a filtrate 

1 Grow the organism in the usual man 
ner m a flask of infusion broth for four 
to five days 

2 Filter the broth through a sterile 
Berkefeld N Mandler. or Seitz filter 

3 Add 0 3 per cent tncresol to the fil 
trate as a preservative Take all possible 
precautions to prevent contamination in all 
stages of the process Do not heat since 
this may destroy some heat labile toxins 

4 Check for stenhty m the usual man

trate with the vacemes, others alternate

preference b> the physiuan 

AD^IIMSTILkTION OF VACCINES 

Owing to the wade vanations m anti- 
gemcity of orgarusms and susceptibilty of 
patients, no defimte dose of a vaccine can 
be stated Usually the course consists of be- 
ginning with a small dose and cautiously 
increasing it until the patient shows either 
improvement or some signs of a reaction, 
such as fever, exacerbation of local disease, 
or an inflammatoiy reaction at the site of 
injection 

For staphylococcus vaccines the usual be 
ginning dose is about 50 million orgamsms 
(0 05 ml of a dilution contaimng 1000 mil 
lion organisms per ml ) The maximal dose 
is usu^ly 1000 million organisms In chil- 
dren the amount given is usually about half 


of the adult dose For vaccines prepared 
with most other bacteria the begmning dose 
IS usually 5 to 10 imllion and the maximum, 
about 100 million 

Injections are given subcutaneously once 
or twice per week In some cases the vac 
cines are giv en ev ery other day or ev cn daily 
Wide indmdual variation exists and de 
pends on the situation and the physician's 
preference 

With regard to the usefulness of the au 
togenous vaccine in staphylococcal condi 
tions we have recently observed situations 
in which Its use seems to be contraindicated 
Several patients have been seen who gave 
histones of recurrent boils There have been 
two groups those with a history covering 
several years of recurrent lesions and those 
with a history of having been given an 
autogenous vaccine a few years previously 
with recent recurrences of the condition 
The lesions in these individuals were char 
actensiic, with a small necrotic center 
covered by a thin membrane and sur 
rounded by a deep red area that tended to be 
swollen and pomful Such lesions are 
reminiscent of an Arthus tvpe reaction 
Lifting the membrane from the central area 
revealed a shallow crater contaimng serous 
fluid, which sometimes was blood tinged 
but was not pus Culture of this fluid re 
vealed coagulase positive Staphj/fococcui 
aureus, which in some cases was antibiouc 
resistant but in others was susceptible to 
most common antibiotics In most cases 
there was a more or less prompt response 
to parenteral or oral treatment with an anti 
biouc to which the particular orgamsm was 
susceptible, but lesions have reappeared on 
cessation of therapy 

In several of these cases autogenous vac 
cines have been prepared, but their use has 
resulted in failure In fact, when sufficient 
dosage of the vaccine was given to produce 
a skin reaction at the site of injection ibere 
tended to be a^are up of old lesions It was 
therefore suspected that the lesions were, in 
deed, Arthus type in nature Serum was col 
lected from a number of these papents be- 
fore and during treatment with the vacciiw 
and It was found that their serum contained 
agglutinating antibodies to titers of 1 512 to 
1 1024 against their homologous staphylo- 
coccus cultures Thus, it would appear that 
some of the recurrent staphylococcal boils 
may progress to the point of showing 
Arthus type phenomena and that m thew 
cases the autogenous vaccine should not be 
used. 



Vaccines and Diagnostic Skin Tests 


809 


BIOLOGIC AND DIAGNOSTIC SKIN 
TESTS 

Skin tests can be divided into at least 
three types, depending on their nature and 
purpose: (I) tests designed to determine 
possible susceptibility or resistance to an 
infection, such as the Schick test in diph- 
theria and the Dick test in scarlet fever; 
(2) tests for “infection allergy,” which 
produce a delayed skin reaction and in 
which a positive test indicates either present 
or past experience with the infectious agent, 
such as the tuberculin test; and (3) tests 
for sensitivity to various types of materials 
to which -individuals react in an exaggerated 
manner, as, for example, in hay fever, 
asthma, food Idiosyncrasies, and hyper- 
sensitivity to horse serum. The skin tests to 
be presented in this section are mainly those 
in the first two categories. An extensive dis- 
cussion of the third category is beyond the 
scope of this book. 

Essentially, then, skin tests are used to 
reveal the presence or absence of the two 
conditions — hypersensitiveness or immu- 
nity. The hypersensitivity of infection, 
such as that revealed by tuberculin, is in 
general an Indication of possible immunity. 
In the test for immunity use Is made of a 
toxic product derived from the disease-pro- 
ducing agent. In normal, nonimmune in- 
dividuals this substance will cause damage 
to the tissue when injected. The immune 
Individual does not react in this way. since 
he possesses free antibody in his skin or 
circulation. In the concentration used, the 
toxin is neutralized and no lesion is pro- 
duced. Tests of this sort are the Schick and 
Dick reactions. 


In tests for hypersensitiveness antigenic 
material to which the normal individual 
does not react is injected. A positive reaction 
is obtained only in the hypersensitive indi- 
vidual. Since the individual presumably will 
not be hypersensitive to the agent unless 
actually infected, the demonstration of 
hypersensitiveness implies infection. There 
are many pitfalls in making a diagnosis 
solely on the basis of a positive skin test 
reaction. In some cases the skin test anti- 
gens are relatively nonspecific and must be 
considered along with other diagnostic 
criteria. 

Diphtheria 

The ScmcK Test for Diphtheria 

The Schick test is a widely used reaction, 
which is helpful in selecting individuals who 
may be susceptible to diphtheria. A positive 
reaction indicates absence of antitoxin. This 
may be an indication for giving prophylactic 
antitoxin. 

The toxin can be obtained commercially 
and is standardized, ready for use. An intra- 
dermal injection of 0.1 ml. is given in the 
forearm. The positive reaction appears in 
three days and is characterized by a circum- 
scribed area of hjiieremia varying from 25 
to 50 mm. in diameter and surrounded by 
^stinct edema. The redness and induration 
gradually disappear, leaving a brownish pig- 
mented area, which may persist three to four 
months (Fig. 20-4). A negative reaction 
may show a mild redness at the site of the 
injection for 24 hours but bears no re- 
semblance to a positive test. A pseudoposi- 
tive reaction occasionally occurs, apparently

owing to an allergic reaction to the protein 
of the autolyzed diphthena bacilli This 
false positive reaction appears earlier than 
the positive reaction and is characterized 
by a central area of redness surrounded by 
a secondary pale red areola This type of 
reaction can be detected with the aid of a 
suitable negative control estabbshed by in 
jecting the same amount of heated toxin 
in the opposite forearm The Schick test is 
considered highly rebable provided the 
proper toxin and controls are used

Owing to a generalized allergic state or 
to bacterial hypersensitivity certain mdi 
viduals may show a severe local and gen 
erabzed reaction following the use of toxoid 
either plain or alum precipitated To detect 
this sensitivity 0 1 ml of plain toxoid is 
injected intracutaneously on the flexor sur 
face of the forearm A posiuve reacuon is 
one in which a red area of 12 mm or more 
appears within 12 to 2<J hours In cases of 
positive reactions the total dosage of toxoid 
may be gi^en carefully m small divided 
doses 

Scarlet Fever 
The Dick. Test 

This test IS used to determine suscepti 
bibty to scarlet fever In recent years be 
cause of the decreasing occurrence of scar 
let fever the test is used less frequently 


than prevTously A solution of diluted scar 
let fever (Dick) toxin is injected intra 
dermally in the same manner as the Schick 
test A positive reaction is seen within 18 
to 24 hours The area around the site of the 
injection is intensely red 3 to 5 cm m 
diameter and markedly swollen with 
sharply raised edges (Fig 20 5) The re 
action js negatne when it shows no more 
than a faint pmk streak along the course 
of the needle and sbghtly positive when 
there is a faint red area measuring less 
than 1 cm with no svvelbng 

A positive reaction signifies that the In 
dividual has insufiicient circulating anti 
toxin to the Dick toxm and is presumablj 
susceptible to scarlet fever Negative reac 
uons indicate that the mdividual is rela 
tively immune to the disease

This test may be used as an aid in the 
diagnosis of scarlet fever especially m dif 
ferentiaung this disease from other condi 
uons such as measles rubella or drug 
allergies which are characterized by a rash 
One tenth miUibter of scarlet fever (horse 
serum) antitoxin is injected intradeimally 
into the area of the skin showing a bnght 
red rash A posiuve reacuon appears 18 to 
24 hours later and consists of a blanched

Tttbercitlm Tests 

Tlie tissues of a tuberculous person are 
sensitized to tuberculin (infection allergy) 
and a reaction occurs when a very minute 
quantity of tuberculin is introduced into 
the body Nontuberculous persons do not 
exhibit such a reaction A positive tubercu 
lin reaction means that the individual dis 
playing it has at some time been infected 
with tubercle bacdli It does not necessarily 
indicate that active clinical tuberculosis is 
present or has ever existed Negative reac 
t ons may be obtained in acute mihary tu 
berculosis because of an anergic reaction 
owing to massive hyposensitization In 
cases of pulmonary tuberculosis the reac 
tion with an ordinary test dose of tubercu 
hn may be negative but this seldom occurs 
m tuberculosis affecting the skin bones or 
IjTnph nodes 

Tuberculin tests are considered valuable 
m children but may be misleading in adults 
since positive reactions occur in a consid 
erable number of apparently healthy adults 
In recent years it has been found that many 
adults with calcified lesions in the lungs 
and negative tubercubn tests react with 
histoplasmm an antigen from the fungus 
llistoplasina capsulatuin Negative tubercu 
Im reactions are helpful in deciding against 
the existence of tuberculosis except early 
in the initial stage of the infection or dur 
ing the advanced or terminal stages of the 
disease Hypersensitivity to tubercubn may 
also be inlublted temporarily by such fac 
tors as B C G vaccination steroid therapy 
or extreme debility Wiien the tuberculous 
lesion is completely healed the skin test 
occasionally converts to negative

Skin Tests in Bacterial Infections 
Brucellosis 

Two types of antigens are used — one a 


killed suspension of Bnicellci organisms 
and the other a solution of protein nucleate 
(Brucellergen) derived from the orgamsm 
One-tenth milliliter of the antigen is given 
intradermally and the reaction is read after

fected individuals the local reaction may 
be accompanied by an exacerbation of

Chancroid 

The antigen (Ducreys or Ito-Reensticma 
vacane) is prepared from cultures of 
Hemophilus ducreyi A positive reaction as 
read after 72 hours and is one in which an 
area of erythema of 14 mm or more and 
an area of induration of 8 mm or more 
appear A positive reaction may persist for 
weeks Such a reacuon indicates that the 
patient either has an acuve infecuon or has

Vaccives and Diagnostic Skiv Tests 


Sftin Tests in Mycotic Infections 
BLASTO^rYcm 

Many patients with North American 
blastomycosis (Gilchrists disease) de\elop 
skin hypersensitivit} to the filtrate of the 
mjceli^ phase of Blastomijces dermatitidts 
This extract known as blastom>cin is 
reasonably specific although there is some 
cross reaction with histoplasmosis The re 
action to the heterologous antigen is always 
less intense than inth the homojogons one 
In practice this skin test antigen is usually 
injected simultaneously with histoplasmin 
coccidioidin and tuberculin 

A positive reaction appears mthin 24 to 
48 hours and consists of an area of indura 
tion 5x5 mm or more A doubtful reac 
tion consists of induration less than 5 mm 
in diameter or erythema only A negame 
reaction shows no induration or erythema 
less than 5 mm 

A positue blastomycin reaction may m 
d-cate either a past infection or a mild 
chronic or subacute infecuon It may also 
denote improvement w cases of serious 
symptomatic blastomycosis which previ 
ously have been blastomycin negative 

CocciDiomiN 

The skin test material for coccldioidomy 
cosis is prepared by grovMng Cocctdioides 
immhjs in Longs synthetic broth for three 
to SIX months filtering and adding Mer 
thiolate to the filtrate Sensitivity is deter 
mined by the intneutaneous injection of 
0 1 ml of a 1 100 dilution of the standard 
ized reagent The immediate reaction if it 
occurs is nonspecific A positn e reaction is 
one in which an area of erythema and m 
duration of 5 mm or more appears withm 
24 to 72 hours 

The skin test becomes positive m 87 per 
cent of patients dunng the first week of 
clinical symptoms and in almost 100 per 
cent of patients after the second week The 
antigen thus is probably the most sensi 
Uve available Patients with a disseminated 
form of the disease may react weakly or 
negatively (anergy) Patients with erythema 
nodosum may be extremely sensitive to the 
antigen which must be given In diluted 
form very cautiously Patients hypersensl 
uve to coccidioidm may react vviih blasio- 
mycin or histoplasmin but less strongly It 
Is therefore the usual practice to perform 
all three tests simultaneously 


Because a positive reaction persists for 
many years it does not necessarily imply 
that active infection is present However a 
positive reaction occurring during an infec 
tion In which an earlier test was negative 
probably has diagnostic value The results 
of the complement fixauon tests must al 
ways be compared mth the results of the 
skin tests Repeated skin testing with cocci 
dioidm does not seem to interfere with sub- 
sequent serologic tests 

Histoplasmw 

The skin test material for histoplasmosis 
IS prepared from Htsloplosma capsiilatum 
m a manner similar to coccid oidin Sensi 
uvlty is determined by injecting 0 1 ml of a 
1 100 diluUon of the standardized reagent 
The immediate reaction is considered non 
specific and is ignored A positive reaction 
appearmg in 24 to 48 hours consists of an 
area of induraUon of 5 mm or more A 
doubtful reaction shows an area of indura 
uon of Jess than 5 mm or erythema greater 
than 5 mm A negauve reaction shows no 
induration and an area of erythema less 
than 5 mm A positive skin test indicates 
past or present infection Acutely 111 pa 
tients however may not develop sensitivity 
or they may develop sensitivity early m the 
disease only to become anergic in the ter 
minal state 

Patients sensitive to histoplasmin may 
cross react with coccidioidin or blastomycin 
particularly the latter Consequently the 
three antigens are best iniected slmul 
taneously 

Mass testing programs with histoplasmin 
have shown that the percentage of reactors 
m presumably normal individuals vanes 
from 0 to over 80 per cent depending on 
the geographic area These studies have 
shed much light on the epidemiology of this 
puzzling disease 

A single Injection of histoplasmin docs 
not alter humoral antibody formation but 
multiple injections may cause a rise In 
agglutinins and complement fixing ami 
bodies

Skin Tests in Viral Diseases 
The Frei Test 

This antigen is used in the diagnosis of 
lymphogranuloma venereum (IjTnphopathia 
venereum Nicolas FavTe disease) (see p 
794) The test first developed by Frei in 
1925 is widely used and practical for the 
diagnosis of this disease It consists of the 
injection of 0 1 ml of antigen and 0 1 ml 
of control material intraderrnally The test 
is read within 48 to 96 hours A raised 
papule 6x6 mm in diameter or more is 
considered a positive reaction provided the 
reaction to the control material is 5 mm or 
less The antigen was onginally prepared 
from pus from a bubo or from infected 
monkey or mouse brain The antigen now 
in common use known as “Lygranum " is 
made from the yolk sac of infected chick 
embryos The control consists of normal 
yolk sac 

The test becomes posiuve one to six 
weeks after infection begins and remains 
positive for the life of the patient The 
specificity IS considered to be of high order 
and closely parallels the results of the com 
plement fixation test Cross reactions with 
psittacosis may occur occasionally 

Cat scratch Disease 

(BETOGN LrMPHOBETlCULOStS) 

The diagnosis of this disease is facilitated 
by the use of an intradermal reaction re 
sembling the Frei test using as an antigen 
heat inactivated suspensions of infected 
lymph nodes or pus (See p 794 ) 

Mumps 

The antigen is prepared from infected 
monkey parotid gland or chick embryo 
allantoic fluid It consists of the injection 
of 0 1 ml of the antigen intracutaneously 
and 0 1 ml of the control matenal (non 
infected matenal corresponding with the 
antigen used) The reaction is read in 48 
hours A positive reaction consisting of 
erythema and a lesion exceeding 10 ram 
in diameter indicates resistance to the 
mumps virus A lesion less than 10 mm 
or no area of erythema Indicates suscepti 
bilily to mumps The rcacuon has no diag 
nostic value and the antigen may give rise 
to complement fixing antibodies 


Lvboratorv Methods 

Skill Tests in Parasitic Diseases 

Echinococcosis 

The antigen employed (Casom) consists 
of sterile hydatid fluid obtained by puncture 
of unilocular cysts from cases of echuiococ 
cosis (hydatid disease) The fluid is filtered 
and concentrated ^ antigen obtained 
from the dog tapeworm Dipyltdium cam 
num may also be used A positiv e reacuon 
IS unme^ate m type usually appeanng 
witbin 15 to 20 minutes after the injection 
of the antigen Positive reactions are not 
absolutely mdicative of infection since 
false positive reactions may occur from 
other cestode infections or hypersensitivity 
to foreign protein m the antigen Comple 
mem fixauon hemagglutmation and pre 
cipitation tests give more reliable results 
(see p 900) 

Toxoplasmin 

The antigen is prepared from mouse pen 
toneal fluids rich with Toxoplasma gondii 
The organisms are inactivated their cell 
bodies are broken up and the antigen is 
standardized and tested for sterility A con 
trol antigen is treated similarly Both ma 
(enals axe injected intraderrnally m 0 1 ml 
amounts Positive reactions which appear 
after 24 or 48 hours consist of an area of 
erythema and indurauon of over 10 mm A 
positive reaction gives results sirmlar to the 
Sabin Feldman dye test le indicates the 
presence of anbbodies to Toxoplasma The 
considerable number of posmve tests ob 
tamed in epidemiologic surveys has caused 
some investigators to question the speci 
ficiiy of the test 

Trichinosis 

The antigen used consists of larval ex 
tracts prepared by peptic digestion of mus 
cics of animals infected with Tnchtnella 
spiralis The test is performed by injecting 
intracutaneously 0 I ml of the antigen as 
well as a control from uninfected tissue 
An Immediate reaction consisting of a 
blanched wheal with pseudopodia sur 
rounded by a zone of erythema appears 
within 10 minutes and is considered to be 
a valuable aid in the diagnosis of this dis 
ease particularly in cases that present oijy 
mild symptoms (Fig 20-8) However as 
many as 10 per cent of the positive reac 
tions may be false It is desirable to draw 
blood for a precipitin agglutination or

complement-fixation test before the skin 
test antigen is injected. 

S«USTOSO»IUSIS 

Intradennal tests are conducted with cer* 
carial or hepatopancreatic glands of in* 
fected snails (AnstralorWs plchmttts), 
which are Infected with Schistosoma man- 
«oni. The cercariae or tissue is concentrated, 
washed, dried, and extracted. Reactions ap- 
pear to be of a group character and are 
used primarily for field work in infected 
areas, 

Lcxshmaniasis 

Intradeimal tests with phenolized saline 
suspensions of killed Leishmottin tropica 
give a positive reaction in oriental sore 
(cutaneous leishmaniasis), hut a high per- 
centage of noninfected individuals cross- 
react with this antigen. 

FlLAttlASrs 

Jntradermal tests are conducted wifi) 
antigens prepared from the dog heart worm, 
Dirofilaria immitis. Positive reactions have 
been obtained in a high percentage of cases 
of infection with XVuchereria bancrofti. 
Since similar results have been obtained 
in loa loa and onchocerciasis, the reaction 
appears to be group specific rather than 
species specific. 

Other Parasitic Skin Tests 

Skin tests for ascariasis. strongyloidiasis, 
cysticcrcosis, sparganosis, and various other 
parasitic diseases have been developed and 
used to some extent. None of them is cur- 


rently generally available or considered to 
be specific enough for diagnostic purposes. 

The Kveim Test 

The Kveim or Nickerson-Kveim reaction 
for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is occasion- 
ally used, but the value of the test Is ques- 
tioned by some. The antigen is prepared by 
grinding human sarcoid tissue, usually 
lymph nodes or spleen. The material is 
diluted 1:10 with saline and heated to 
60® C. for one hour on two successive days. 
A preservative is added, and after suitable 
sterility tests the antigen is ready for use. 
Controls consist of suspensions of normal 
tissues. 

The test is done by injecting 0.1 to 0.2 
ml. intradcrznally. In a positive test a red- 
purple papule appears in about a week and 
grows gradually in size until it reaches a 
diameter of 3 to 8 mm. in four to six weeks. 
A biopsy of the papule is examined for tu- 
berculoid granulomas resembling those of 
sarcoidosis. Such a reaction combined with 
a negative reaction In the controls is con- 
sider^ posltlv-e for sarcoidosis and is re- 
ported to occur in approximately 80 to 85 
per cent of cases, remaining positive for 
the life of the patient. The specificity is 
considered to be of high order and closely 
parallels the results of the complement- 
fixation test. Cross-reactions with psittacosis 
may occur occasionally.

IS filled to the 0 mark wtb concentrated 
sulfunc acid adding a few drops at a time 
and agitating constantly This is revolved 
in the centrifuge at 1000 rpm for three 
minutes or until the fat has separated The 
percentage of fat is then read off on the 
stem each small division representing 0 2 
per cent of fat 

Protein 

Hogg’s ModiRcation of Esbachs Test To 
prepare Boggs reagent dissolve 25 gm of 
phosphotungstic acid in 125 ml of distilled 
water Add 25 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid to 100 ml of distilled water 
Mix the two solutions This reagent is fairly 
stable if kept in a dark glass bottle 

Technique The technique of this test 
is similar to that of Esbachs test for al 
bumin in urine Before examination the 
milk should be diluted according to the 
probable amount of protein and allowance 
for the dilution should be made In the sub- 
sequent reading The optimal dilution is 
1 10 for human milk and 1 20 for cows 
milk The dilution must be made accurately 

Combined Method for Quantitative De 

TERMINATION OF PROTEIN AND FaT 

The amount of fat and protein in human 
milk can be esumated roughly but ac 
curate!) enough for many clinical purposes 
fay means of Holts apparatus which con 
sists of a 10 zni cream gauge and a small 
hydrometer The cream gauge is blted to 
the 0 mark and allowed to stand for 24 
hours The percentage of cream then can 
be read on the gauge The percentage of 
fat is three fifths that of cream 

The amount of protein can be determined 
approximately from the specific gravity and 
from the percentage of fat Since the 
amounts of salts and sugar seldom vary 
sufficiently to affect the specific gravit) a 
high specific gravity must be due either to 
an increase of protein or to a decrease of 
fat or both and vice versa If the specific 
gravity is normal the amount of protein 
is high when the amount of fat is high and 
vice versa This method is not accurate with 
cow’s milk 

Lactose 

The protein should first be removed by 
acidifying with acetic acid boiling and 
filtering The copper method may then be 
used as for dextrose in the urine It must 
be borne in mmd that lactose reduces cop- 


per more slowly than does dextrose that 
longer heating is therefore required and 
that 25 ml of Benedicts solution is equiva 
lent to 0 0676 gm of lactose (as compared 
with 0 05 gm of dextrose) 

Preservatives 

Formalin is the most common preserva 
tive added to cows milk but bone acid also 
IS used 

Test for Forinalin 

Reagents 

1 Dilute solution of feme chloride 
(approximately 10 per cent) 

2 Chemically pure sulfuric acid 

Technique 

1 Add a few drops of the dilute solu 
non of feme chloride to a few ml of the 
milk 

2 Run the mixture gently on the sur 
face of some chemically pure sulfuric acid 
m a test tube If formaldehyde is present 
a bright red nng will appear at the line of 
contact of the two fluids This test is not 
specific for formaldehyde but no other 
substance that is likely to be added to the 
nulk will respond to the test Jorissens test 
for formaldehyde may also be used 

Goskes Test for Boric Acid 

Reagent Concentrated hydrochloric 

aad 

Technique 

1 Mix 2 ml of hydrochloric acid with 
20 ml of milk and place the mLxture In 
a 50 ml beaker 

2 Jn the mixture suspend a long strip 
of turmenc paper (2 cm wide) so that its 
end reaches the bottom of the beaker 
Allow to remain about a half hour The 
liquid will nse by capillarity and a reddish 
brown color will appear at the junction of 
the moist and dry portions of the paper if 
boric acid is present When this colored 
zone of the paper is touched with ammonia 
water a bluish green slate color will de 
vclop A rough idea of the amount of boric 
acid that is present may be gained by com 
paring the depth of the color produced with 
that produced by solutions of boric acid of 
known concentration 


Bacteriologic Examinntioii 

At times it is necessary to knmv the types 
of pathogenic microorganisms that arc pres 
ent in a given sample of milk especially 
If it is suspected that the use of such milk 
has been the cause of disease Epidemics of 
undulani fever bovine tuberculosis typhoid 
fever or a verv virulent form of strepto- 



Milk and Water 


coccic sore throat often have been traced 
to a milk supply. Milk differs from water In 
that it is an excellent medium for the 
growth of many pathogenic bacteria. Usu- 
ally, however, bacleriologic examination of 
milk consists of plating the milk in such a 
manner that an estimate can be made of 
the number of bacteria in each cubic mil- 
limeter. Standards of milk qu.ality vary from 
one locality to another. Excellent milk may 
hax’e only a few hundred bacteria in each 
ml. Milk that contains less than 10,000 bac- 
teria on delivery would be considered very 
good; milk that contains less than 50,000 
would be considered good. Poor milk, yet 
commercially usable, may contain 500,000 
bacteria per ml., while milk that should not 
be used may contain so many bacteria that 
they cannot be counted. 

Bacterial Count 

“Standard Methods for the Examination 
of Dairy Products," which has been pub- 
lished by the American Public Health Asso- 
ciation, should be followed in detail in mak- ; 
ing a bacterial count of milk. Briefly the t 
technique is as follows: 

1. Prepare "water blanks," sterile bottles 
preferably with glass stoppers. Some of 
these should contain exactly 99 ml. of water 
and others only 9 ml. Sterilize in the auto- 
clave at 15 pounds pressure for one hour 
(Fig. 21-2). 

2. Melt tryptone-glucosc-ycast or milk- 
protein hydrolysate agar. 

3. Shake the sample of milk thoroughly 
and dilute as follow'S; Place 1 ml. of milk 
in a bottle containing 99 ml. of sterile 
wafer; discard this pipet. AVlth a sterile 
pipet transfer 1 ml. of the 1:100 dilution 
to a bottle containing 9 ml. of sterile water. 
With the same pipet transfer 1 ml. of 1:100 
dilution to a sterile Petri dish. With a fresh 
sterile pipet make still another dilution by 
transferring I ml. of 1:1000 dilution to a 
bottle containing 9 ml. of sterile water. 
With this same pipet transfer 1 ml. of 
1:1000 dilution to a sterile Petri dish. 
Finally, use a fresh sterile pipet to transfer 
I ml. of 1:10,000 dilution to a sterile Pcirl 
dish. All dilutions must be shaken 25 times 
before making any transfers. 

4. Pour 10 ml. of melted and cooled agar 
into each Petri dish. The milk dilution and 
the agar arc mixed thoroughly by gentle 
shaking. 

5. Incubate the cultures for 48 hours at 
32® C. and at 35° C. 

G. Count the colonics. Only those plates 
arc chosen in which tJjcrcare not more than 


810 

300 but not less than 30 colonics In the 
entire Petri dish (Fig. 21-3). 

7. Calculate the number of organisms 
for each ml. for the count and the dilution, 
for example, if there arc 256 colonies in 
the plate and the dilution is 1:1000. the 
number of bacteria in each ml. \vjll be 
256.000. 

Besides the colony count obtained by the 
standard plate count method, the Breed 
microscopic method Js useful, particularly 
in judging the quality of milk dell\cred to

The approval of water supplies for do 
mestic purposes and the examination of 


water m swimming pools and at beaches is 
a pubhc health problem and is usually con 
ducted in the state board of health or mum 
cipal laboratones However, the chnical 
laboratory is sometimes called on to pass 
judgment on the potability of dnnkmg 
water and also to make a routine examma 
tion of water that is known to be usable 
The color turbidity, and odor should be 
noted Chemical examination may be made 
for total sohd nitrogen as free ammonia 
and also nitrogen as albuminoid ammoma 
nitrogen as nitrites or mtrates and organic 
nitrogen The amount of oxygen and chlo- 
rides the total hardness and the alkalinity 
may also be determined All these proce 
dures are earned out accordmg to the stand 
ard methods as laid down fay the Amencan 
Pubhc Health Association (i955) 

The bactenologic exammation of water 
is also earned out according to standard 
methods Bnefly the examination is made 
for the number of bactena per cubic mil 
limetcr The sample of water in a sterile 
container should be shaken 25 times before

Tests should also be made for the pres 
ence of members of the colifotm group 
According to the standard methods pre 
sumptive tests may be made with 10 ml , 
1 ml , and 0 1 ml of the sample of the 
water placed m a lactose broth fcrmenta 
tion tube 

If these tests are posilne, conSxmatory 
tests may be earned out by plating positive 
lactose tubes on Endo’s or E^^B agar to 
determine the presence of typical cob colo 
nies The complete test consists of picking 
typical coliform colonies from the plates 
Into lactose fermentation tubes and gram 
staining the tubes showing gas 

A simple and customary method of test- 
ing for the presence of the coliform group 
of ozgamsms is the following Place 10 ml 
of water m each of five fermentation tubes 
containing 10 ml of double strength lactose 
broth If there is no gas formed in any of 
the tubes, Eschenchm coU js not present 
in a 50 ml sample of the water, and it is 
probable that it is not present in 100 ml 
if one tube shows 10 per cent of gas, then 
there is at least one colon bacillus present 
in 50 ml , and the report may be made that 
at least two colon baciHi are present per 
100 ml of the sample of water TTiis 
amount is considered permissible in drink 
ing water If more than one tube contains 
gas, it may be well to carry out the con 


finnatory or complete tests, because the 
water is hkely to be contaminated If all 
five tubes show gas, it would be endem that 
there are at least ten colon bacilU per 100 
ml of the sample, and such water would 
be badly contaminated 
In recent years a new method of testing 
water suppbes for the presence of cobform 
bactena has been under study, it is called 
the membrane filter technique (Fig 21-4) 
This technique involves the passage of a 
measured amount of the water to be tested 
through a standard cellulose filter which 
will retain the bacteria (MiUipore HA or its 
equivalent) Bactenafrom the water sample 
become implanted on the filter, which is 
then carefully transferred to a Petn dish 
contaimng an absorbent pad saturated with 
an appropriate nutrient medium The plate 
IS inverted and incubated at 35“ C :± 0 5° 
for two hours Then the filter pad is trans 
ferred to new Petn dishes contaimng ab- 
sorbent pads , saturated with difiereniJal 
media such as Edl C Endo medium or 
B G F TTiedmm, and reincubated for 20 i: 2 
hours Tjpical coliform colonies appear with 
a characteristic metalbc sheen (Fig 21-S)

Hospital Epidemiology 

JAMES G SHAFFER Sc D «nrf MILTON GOLDIN MS 


It has been recognized for many years 
that the hospital environment presents spe- 
cial problems in the prevention of the 
spread of infections from patient to patient 
iiom patient to the hospital personnel and 
from hospital personnel to patients Studies 
have indicated that there are increased 
numbers of pathogenic organisms in the 
hospital environment as compared to the 
normal environment a finding that is not 
surprising in view of the fact that con 
slderable numbers of the patients admitted 
are suffering from infections of vanous 
kinds As hospital practices have evolved 
over the years the recognition of these 
dangers has led to the development of iso 
lation techniques applied to patients with 
well recognized infectious diseases such as 
the pneumonias diphthena typhoid fever 
and dysentery Such specific isolation tech 
niques have been documented thoroughly 
and applied effectivelj with good results 
Numerous developments and observations 
of relatively recent years have changed the 
situation somewhat and have renewed in 
terest in the problems presented by the 
transmission of infectious agents within the 
hospital Some of the problems have always 
been present but were no doubt overshad 
owed m the past by the pressing need for 
dealing with the large numbers of acute 
infecUous diseases that placed enormous 
demands on the time of the often Inade 
quate hospital staff Some new facets have 
resulted in part from the widespread use of 
the sulfonamides and the antibiotics wluch 
has brought about important changes in the 
microbial flora of the hospital environment 
the discov ery of certain previously unknown 
disease producing agents such as the en 


teropathogenlc Escbencbfn coli and certain 
enteronruses and the increased use of 
blood blood derivatives and therapeutic 
agents given by injection which may result 
in the development of hepatitis 

THE ROLE OF CHEMOTHERyVPEUTIC 
AGENTS 

The anubioucs have had most interesting 
and far reaching effects Their use both for 
therapeutic and prophylactic management 
of infection resulted m the development of 
considerable complacency about the need 
for measures to prevent transmission of 
roicroorgamsms within the hospital en 
vironment Consequently carelessness re 
suited It is now obv’lous that the widespread 
use of these agents within the hospital 
environment may be dangerous ind it has 
also become increasingly apparent that the 
prophylactic use of antibiotics is not always 
successful in prevenung the development of 
infection in bums and surgical incisions 
Many of the microorganisms involved in 
these Infections are now of a type con 
siderably dlfl’ereni from those that caused 
the greatest concern in preanilbiotic times 
They are likely to be relatively antibiotic 
resistant bacteria normally a part of the 
body flora which in the healthy intact hu 
man host with normal resistance would 
not cause difiiculty However when im 
planted at a suitable site in or upon a 
patient whose resistance is already lowered 
by illness such orgamsms may often pro- 
duce active Infection sometimes with scri 
ous consequences This type of disease pre 
sents problems of prevenuon that arp not 
easy to solve because the organisms in

YoUed are so widely distnbuted throughout 
the population Howe\er, it is hkely Aat a 
return to stnct asepsis which was widely 
practiced in the preantibiotic penod, would 
accomphsh much This will be discussed 
in a general w a> m a later section 

Dnig restslaiit Orgauums 

Perhaps the most serious danger of the 
isidespread use of antibiotics is illustrated 
by the emergence of drug resistant strains 
of pathogemc StapJiylococcus aureus For 
tunately this is the only pathogemc micro* 
orgamsm that has as yet ejAihited this 
tendency to the extent of causmg senous 
consequences The mechamsm by ivhich 
resistant strains dcYclop is not completely 
understood but the result is that \7ithin 
the hospital emironment there have ap- 
peared increasmg numbers of these strains 
With any given antibiotic the relative pro- 
portion of resistant to susceptible scrams 
depends on the extent to which that and 
biouc IS used m the hospital So far the 
problems presented by drug resistant S 
aureus have been restricted almost exclu- 
sively to the hospital environment since 
there has been no great increase in the rela 
tive per cent of resistant orgamsms in non 
hospital areas One might expect however, 
that as tune goes on more resistant strams 
will become dissemmated ui the general 
population 

In order to understand better the prob- 
lems presented by the drug resistant Staph 
ylococcits aureus it is necessary to know 
somethmg of the nature of the orgamsm 
It IS widely distributed in nature and is 
capable of survival for long penods of tune 
m the environment attached to dust parti 
cles droplets or droplet nuclei vanous sur 
faces bedclothmg and so forth Not only 
does It survive for long periods but the 
pathogemc strams also maintain their 
pathogemcity 

Numerous studies have revealed that this 
orgamsm establishes itself readily m or 
upon the human host It has been isolated 
from the throat and the nasal passages 
of up to 50 per cent of the personnd m 
certam areas of hospitals and it is prob- 
able that all persons carry the orgamsm 
penodically Exposed areas of the skin 
particularly the hands are also commonly 
contaimnated Most individuals are only 
temporary earners of S aureus but a few 
become permanent earners of the organ 
isms wiueft are cansCsndy present in Xhe 
nose and the throat or over wide areas of 


the skm This poses a senous problem if 
the individual happens to work m a cnucal 
area of the hospital such as the operating 
room or nursery 

S aureus comprises an antigemcally het 
erogeneous group of organisms, some 
pathogemc and some nonpathogemc the 
classification of which is difficult The 
development of successful techmques for 
typu^g the orgamsms with specific bacteno- 
phages has been helpful, and in recent 
years this problem has ^en studied m 
tensively Such studies have revealed that 
certam phage types are more prone to 
produce epidemics withm the hospital en 
vironment and that when such outbreaks 
occur usually only one type is involved 
Sporadic cases are more hkely to be caused 
by a vanety of types Hospital acquired 
staphylococcal infections are of several 
types Surgical wound infections infection 
of bums and other lesions pneumoma skm 
mfecuons m infants and breast abscesses 
m newly delivered mothers are the most 
common although boils and carbuncles 
may also occur 

Studies of hospital acquired staphylococ 
cal infections have revealed that the true 
picture of their occurrence cannot be ob- 
tamed merely by tabulatmg the number of 
cases that axe seen during the hospital stay 
of the patients In fact the number of 
cases that develop after discharge from the 
hospital 15 considerably greater than the 
number developing dunng hospitalization 
This is particularly characteristic of infec 
Uons in infants and mothers The situation 
has been compared to an iceberg m which 
the portion that is readily visible represents 
only a small portion of what actually ex 
ists Such a finding is not surpnsing sines 
the meubaUon period of many of these 
infections lasts several days dunng which 
time no symptoms are present This no 
doubt applies also to other types of hospital 
acquired mfecUon Thus an mstituQon 
cannot truly evaluate its own situation m 
this regard without makmg every effort to 
follow its patients for a considerable penod 
(14 to 21 days) after discharge 

A more complete descnption of S aureus 
and Its fundamental cultural charactcnstics 
will be found in Chapter 16 and m the 
textbooks and references listed m the bib- 
liography There is still much to be learned 
about this important bactenum and it is 
hoped that an antibiotic to which resistance 
does not develop will be discovered 

Thus the Midespcesd use of antibiotic 
and chemotherapeutic agents has brought 



Hospital Etidfmioloc^ 


823 


into sharp focus some of the general prob- 
lems of hospital epidemiology The total 
epidemiologic consideration facing the 
modem hospital still involves most of the 
microorganisms long recogmzed as senous 
pathogens These are constantly being in 
troduced into the hospital emaronment and 
must be dealt ^%ith effectively to prevent 
tlieir spread within the population of the 
institution These include such bacteria as 
Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) Diplo 
coccus pneumoniae, and Neissena menm- 
gtlidis, the vanous viruses that affect the 
respiratory system, and certain fungi, such 
as Candida albicans In general measures 
designed to control the spread of S aureus 
will be effective in controlling the spread 
of most of the other orgamsms 

THE ROLE or ENTEROPATHOGENS 

Enteropathogenlc microorgamsms are 
another potential source of difficulty These 
present somewhat diifferent problems than 
the organisms just discussed, suice they are 
usually ingested by the indUadual who be 
comes infected and ate discharged from 
the body in the feces A variety of orgamsms 
have been invob ed in outbreaks of diarrhea 
and dysentery in hospitals, including 
Salmonella SJitpella, enteropathogemc E 
coll (in nurseries), and ECHO viruses 
These outbreaks have been traced to car 
Tiers among the hospital personnel or pa 
tients and to breaks in technique 

In one instance ive observed that cases 
of diarrhea were occurring in a respiratory 
disease ward of a children s hospital 
Symptoms appeared three or four days after 
tlie patient had been admitted, and cultural 
examination yielded no consistent findmgs, 
that is there appeared to be no organism 
common to all cases Investigation revealed 
that the staff on daily rounds went irom 
the diarrhea ward directly to the respiratory 
ward When the course of the rounds was 
changed and precautions were taken to 
avoid transfer of orgamsms on hands and 
instruments, no further cases occurred 

It IS important to check the personnel m 
critical areas periodically with adequate 
stool examinations Although the protozoan 
parasite Entamoeba histolytica, has rarely 
been reported as the causative agent in an 
outbreak m a modem hospital its trans 
mission may be accomplished in the same 
manner as the other entenc pathogens and 
it is highly desirable that all infected hos 
pital personnel be treated adequately One 
report described seteral cases of ameblads 
In a premature nursery 


Prevention of Entenc Disease 

The prevention of hospital acquired en 
teric disease depends on at least four 
precautions (1) Adequate control of food 
handling and dispensing operations, includ 
mg the detection and ehmmation of carriers 
among the food handlmg personnel careful 
control of food preparation dishwashing 
and garbage disposal, and adequate refng 
eration of stored food, (2) careful attention 
to personal hygiene b} all food handlers 
physicians, nurses and hospital employees 
with specif attention to hand washing and 
the use of disinfectant soaps (3) care in 
the disposal and sterilization of materials 
contaminated with fecal matter such as 
diapers and rectal thermometers and (4) 
complete isolation of patients wath diarrhea 
and dysentery These general measures are 
of the utmost importance, since it is not 
always possible to detect earners when cul 
nires are done, and even when tliey are 
done they can only be done periodically 
One can never be sure what the situation is 
in the meantime 


THE CONTROL PROGR^V^f 

The overall prevention of hospital ac 
quired infection depends almost entirely on 
cooperauve efforts on the part of all groups 
mvolved in the operation of the mstituiion 
A control program of the type needed may 
be compared aptly to a chain that is only 
as strong as its weakest link Ideally it is 
desirable to form a committee on infection 
made up of the most responsible person of 
each department concerned The commiilee 
should formulate a definite program based 
on the soundest principles known The pro- 
gram should be defined clearly witii rules 
and regulations and made known to all 
hospital personnel Some individual, per 
haps designated as the hospital epidemiolo- 
gist. should be charged with the responsi 
bility for administering the program 

Jn the following discussion further atten 
lion will be given to general measures de 
signed to prevent the spread of mferoorgan 
isms within the hospital environment but 
will not include discussions of tlic isolation 
(e^niques used for the patients with spe 
cific infectious diseases who may Iw ad 
mittcd to the hospital The types of disease 
requiring isolation may be defined by health 
department regulations or may lie deter 
mined by the committee on infections or by 
hospital adminlstrauve policy It is assiimc<i

they are, at any rate, beyond the scope of 
this book 

In carrying out the program designed to 
pre\ent the spread of microorganisms %vjlh 
in the hospital, the clinical microbiology 
laboratory plays a major role It must be 
prepared, m addition to doing the regular 
studies on patients, to do periodic cultural 
studies on the members of the hospital 
personnel, to maintain a surveillance of 
sterilization procedures and the efficacy of 
dishwashing procedures and laundry opera- 
tions and to assist in epidemiologic follow 
up on any outbreaks of infectious disease 
ivithin the institution Ideally the laboratory 
should be prepared to do certain enwon 
mental studies to help evaluate the efficacy 
of terminal disinfection of rooms occupied 
by patients mth infectious disease and to 
evaluate the relati\e contaimnauon of the 
air m %arious areas and under ^anous con 
dmons For this it is necessary to use a 
standardized method for taking air samples, 
several methods are available It is also 
desirable to work out a techmque for taking 
cultures from surfaces of vanous types 

Transmmioit of Microorganisms 

Transmission of microorganisms occurs 
m a variety of ways, the primary mode with 
any particular organism depending on the 
site of Its localization in the infected indi 
vndual and the route by which u character 
istically enters its new host At least five 
common means of transmission are im 
portant in hospital practice direct, fomites 
(indirect), food water, and air 

Direct Transmmjon The first of these 
the direct route, may be defined to include 
both actual physical contact and close prox 
unity such that microorganisms can be 
transmitted by droplet directly through the 
air from the infected to the nomnfected m 
dividual 

Fomiie Transmission Fomites provnde an 
indirect means of transmission and include 
all inanimate objects that may be handled 
bv Or in contact with an infected individual 
These include thermometers, linen, blan 
kets any piece of apparatus used m giving 
anesthesia or in doing a basal metabolism 
test into which a patient may breathe 
pencils, stethoscopes and surgical instru 
ments 

Transmusion in Food and ^Vatc^. Food 
may act as a vehicle for several pathogenic 
mieroorganisms, the best known being the 
enteric pathogens and the organisms most 
commonly associated with food poisoning. 


Salmonella and Staphylococcus Food borne 
outbreaks of streptococcal disease liave also 
occurred, and it is entirely possible for epi- 
demic strains of S aureus to be transmitted 
in this way 

With modem methods of water treat- 
ment It IS unlikely, under normal cixcum 
stances, that water home disease would 
occur in present-day hospitals, but it is 
nevertheless well to maintain constant 
checks on the water supply Water may 
play a role in another way, it has been 
shown that if water carafes are allowed to 
stand for extended periods at the patient’s 
bedside, considerable growth of bactena may 
occur Thorough sterilization of these con- 
tainers between use and redistribution is 
absolutely necessary 

Transmission by Air The role played by 
air m the transmission of mfecQon has 
been the subject of extensive mvestigation 
for many vears, and the attitude of epi 
demiologists toward the importance of air- 
borne infection has vaned firom tune to 
tune The wadespread dissemmation of drug 
resistant staphylococa and the occurrence 
of In hospital infections with this and other 
organisms has renewed interest in the air 
as a possible v ehide of microbial transmis- 
sion 

It IS necessary for purposes of discussion 
to define what is generally accepted as air- 
borne transmission as opposed to direct 
contact, which has already been defined to 
include physical contact as well as drop- 
let infection This necessarily impbes close 
proximity, suice droplets settle very rapidly 
and present httle hazard beyond a distance 
of 3 to 6 feet Air borne transmission thus 
unphes that the orgamsms be suspended 
in the air and that they settle on an exposed 
surface or be inhaled m the process of 
breathing Bactena seldom, if ever, exist in 
the au of a room unless they are attached 
to another particle Such particles are of two 
types, dust or droplet nuclei The droplet 
nucleus has been defined as the minute 
remnants that remain after the evaporation 
of all or most of the moisture from what 
was ongmaJly a droplet These two types of 
particles behave in diiTerent manners Dust 
panicles settle fairly rapidly under normal 
circumstances but are rather easily resus 
pended by any activity or by convection 
currents within a room Apjjarently owing 
to their very small size, droplet nuclei 
remain suspended in the air for long penods 
of time and tend to settle out much more 
dowly than dust particles (Fig 22-1)

chute the air is compressed and this causes 
puffs of air to come out the door on each

This may result in considerable release of 
bacteria into the air surrounding the door

Although epidemiologists have doubted 
the importance of air borne transmission of 
infectious disease m the general population 
this does not necessarily apply to the hos 
pital environment for at least two reasons 
First as pointed out before there is hkely 
to be a considerably greater concentration 
of potentiallj pathogcmc microorgamsms 
m the hospital environment, and second 
among hospital patients there are individu 
als with lowered resistance who are more 
prone to develop disease after minimal ex 
posure Thus it would seem to be impera 
tive that great consideration be given to 
reducing the nsk of airborne infection 
Tnbercn/ojiJ Tuberculosis deserves 
special comment Although it has charac 
tensticall> been referred to as a contact 
disease there is increasing evidence that 
It may be primarily air borne Such evidence 
has been derived m port from studies in 
animals and from the repeated demonstra 
tion of acid fast orgamsms in the air in the 
hospital rooms of tuberculous patients in 
lahoratones and m autopsy rootcis 

Examwattoti of Persouuel 

The general measures necessary for pre 
\enUon of m hospital infection must be 
designed to reduce the nsk of both direct 
and indirect transmission of microorgan 
isms from person to person This requires 
control of personnel and their practices and 
control of the environment so as to reduce 
the microbial population in every way pos 
sible In the succeeding secUon the measures 
that should be applied will be discussed 

The pre-employment examination of all 
personnel should include a chest x ray or 
tuberculin test nose and throat cultures 
and a complete stool examination including 
bacterial culture and examination for ova 
and parasites Ideally at least three stool 
examinations should be done on successive 
days For persons to be employed in nurs 
cries and in pediatnc wards the stool cul 
lure should include an examination for 
entcropathogcnic Eschenchta coU When 


shortages of laboratory personnel make it 
impossible to do three or more stool ex 
aminations on all employees tins may be 
limited to food handlers and to pediatric 
and nursery personnel It is important that 
no person found carrying pathogenic micro- 
orgamsms m the stool be put on duty in a 
cnticol area until the organism is eradi 
cated It must also be remembered that 
earners often either have very few organ 
isms in the stool or shed them only pen 
odically hence the need for more than a 
single examination Especially if Staphylo- 
coccus aureus or Streptococetts pyogenes 
(Group A) IS found positive findings m 
nose or throat cultures should be followed 
up with repeated cultures to determine 
whether the individual is a earner 

Following employment periodic cultural 
studies on the hospital personnel are desir 
able Those assigned to cntical areas such 
as nurseries pediatncs and obstetric sen 
ices operating rooms and food handling 
areas, should be checked more frequently 
than those in admimstrativ e sections where 
contact with patients may not be frequent 
Since the situation within a given institu 
tion is different from that in any other 
institution the frequency and extent of 
these studies will need to be worked out to 
satisfy particular needs The purposes pos 
sible benefits and Lmitations of the cultural 
exammauon of the hospital personnel must 
be thoroughly understood before the pro- 
gram IS designed 

Carriers and Active Infections 

The purpose of cultural exantlmtion is 
to discover earners It may be desirable to 
remove earners from certain cntical areas 
but this may have only limited value and 
will depend on circumstances A somewhat 
different benefit is the possibility that 
through these studies the personnel may be 
kept aware of the dangers involved and of 
the need for observing caution in their daily 
activities 

In most cases the earner state is only 
transitory especially in the nose and throat 
and to some extent in the intestinal tract 
and a positive finding on culture signifies 
only that the organism was present at the 
time the specimen was taken In fact at the 
time the culture is examined 24 to 48 hours 
after the specimen is taken the individual 
may no longer be carrying the organism In 
order to establish the earner state it is 
necessary to do repeated cultures on all 
those who arc positive on the first examina 
tion Therefore it is useless and impractical 



Hospital Epidemiology 


to remove Individuals from dut> merely on 
the basis of a single positi\e findmg This 
IS well illustrated if one considers the situa 
tion presented by Staphylococcus aureus in 
which on any given day it may be found 
that 01 er 50 per cent of the personnel m a 
nursery or other area haie posioie cultures 
If such a group had cultures taken on the 
succeedmg day undoubtedly seieral of 
those previously positive would be negabve 
and several of those originally negative 
would be positive Fortunately none of the 
other well recogmzed pathogens induce this 
carrier rate with the possible exception of 
D pjieitinoTiiae under most unusual circum 
stances 

The situation is somewhat different with 
the enteric pathogens such as Entamoeba 
histolytica Giardta lamblia Dientatnoeba 
fragilis and the helminths in which the 
earner state tends to persist regularly for 
a long time The same situation exists to a 
v’arying degree with the entenc bacterial 
pathogens Fortunately a much lower per 
centage of individuals normally have posi 
tive findings of entenc pathogens and their 
removal from a cntical area such as a 
nursery may not result m a serious deple 
tion of personnel All infected persons 
should be removed from nursenes and food 
handlmg activities however especially 
those who have Salmonella Shigella or 
Entamoeba histolytica 

The situation with enteropatfiogemc E 
coll requires special comment Individuals 
who work in nursenes are evidently ex 
posed to si^cial risks and a considerable 
number are likely to be found carrying this 
organism The earner slate is not easy to 
elimmale and it may be unpractical to 
remove all earners from duty Thus ah 
measures to prevent transmission are neces 
sary 

Epidemiologic investigation of outbreaks 
of infection have indicated that the person 
suflenng from an active infection is as a 
rule more dangerous than the carrier im 
doubtedly because of tlie likeliliood that the 
number of orgamsms present in the actively 
infected individual is much greater than m 
the earner It is thus imperative that lodi 
vaduals with evidence of active infection 
1 e upper respiratory mfections sore 
throat ear infections diarrhea or infected 
lesions of the skin or nail bed be discovered 
and removed from cntical areas at the 
eaihest possible moment Employees should 
be removed from duty and patients should 
be isolated if at all possible Tins is particu 
larly cntical m the nursery since the new

bom infant tends to be highly suscepbble 
to certain types of infection such as stapb 
7 lococcal disease moniliasis and dysentery 
Daily inspection of all persons as they come 
on duti in operating rooms nursenes sur 
gical wards obstetric service pediatric 
wards central supply and food handling 
areas should be made by a competent and 
responsible individual Bactenologic exam 
motion IS of little or no immediate help in 
most of these Instances except for diag 
nosis since cultural results are not avail 
able for 24 to 48 hours and direct smears 
from lesions may be inconclusive 

It must be remembered that all infections 
have an incubation period and that ilus 
incubation period can be variable For ex 
ample m newborn mfants the incubation 
period for staphylococcal disease ma> be 
one to thirt> days During the incubation 
period of any infection and especially m 
the period just prior to the appearance of 
symptoms the mdivldual may become 
highly infectious Thus the removal of an 
individual with chmcally evident infection 
merel> takes away a danger that has already 
been present for an unknown period 
Obvnously then the discov ery of earners 
and active cases and theix removal from the 
environment does not eliminate the danger 
of nosocomial infection There is no ques 
non however that these measures will re- 
duce the nsk To further reduce the nsk 
and since no indivaduai can ever vvitii cer 
timtybe adjudged free of potentially patho- 
gemc microorganisms it is necessarj to 
design and observe procedures to prevent 
the transmission of organisms from hospital 
personnel to patient and from patient to 
personnel Here it must be re-emphasized 
that when one speaks of “potentially patho 
genic” imcroorgamsms one refers not only 
to the well recognized pathogens but also to 
those organisms of the nonnal body flora 
which when Implanted m or upon the 
patient whose resistance has been lowered 
by operation or disease ma) cause serious 
consequences

permanent earners of certain organisms

infections it is necessary to design tech 
nlques that ivill apply to all personnel 
iMthin a ghen service Ser\nces that deal 
with patients who are likely to be most 
susceptible to infection need the most 
stringent regulation 

No person should be allowed in a nursery 
ivho has not put on a surgical type gown 
suppbed from a fresh stock by the nursery 
It is also necessary at all times for all nurs 
cry personnel to wear surgical caps that 
cover the hair effectivel) Tlus is an im 
portant consideration since the hair is 
constantly exposed to dust that may be in 
the atmosphere and may act as a reservoir 
Masks must also be worn at all times and 
it is important that the type of mask be 
chosen carefully The most common t>pe 
in use is the standard gauze mask consist 
mg of four or more Ja)ers of a suitable 
gauze of such size as to cov er the nose and 
mouth Its effectiveness is limited to the 
time it takes for the mask to become saiu 
rated with bacteria containing moisture 
^Vhcn this occurs the mask becomes a 
hazard rather than a protection for patient 
and wearer alike The time for saturation 
to occur has been variousl) estimated from 
30 minutes to one or two hours To ^ 
elTecuve the mask must be worn at all times 
and should be changed at frequent inter 
vals the length of such intervals depending 
on the situation The mask must never be 
allowed to hang loosely about the neck 
since this allows drying to occur and when 
the mask is replaced over the nose and 
mouth large numbers of orgamsms may be 
spra)cd into the atmosphere Unless used 
properly the mask may be an actual danger 
and ma) produce a false sense of sccunty 
Another important point is that the edges 
of the mask may rub the skin and loosen 
flakes that contain bacteria It may be 
desirable to use a face cream to prevent this 
from happemng 

Care of the hands is particularly im 
portant and special attenuon should be 
given to handwashing Hands must be 
scrubbed with disinfectant solutions on 
entry into the nursery and the washing 
should be repeated between the handling 
of patients Since the area under the finger 
nails is a good rcposftorj for microorganisms 
and Is not casil) sterilized b> even the most 
vigorous scrubbing it is desirable to keep 
the nails well trimmed at all times 

The following is an example of the need 
for all persons to observe precautions in 


firder to av oid transmission of micro- 
orgamsms Numerous cases of momliasts 
were occurring in the nursery of a large 
private hospital Investigation by a con 
sultant revealed that the most stringent 
liousekceping measures were being observed 
and that the nurses were required to wear 
caps masks and gowns and to wash their 
hands with disinfectant soap between the 
handling of each infant There were no 
detectable breaks within the nursery Fur 
ther investigation however revealed that 
the ph)sicians were allowed free access to 
the nursery to examine an infant without 
even washing their hands if they so chose 
As soon as the ph)sicians were supplied 
with gowns masks and adequate hand 
washing facilities no further cases of 
momliasis occurred 

Recent studies have shown that shoes 
may become heavily contaminated with 
microorganisms and it is important to 
supply for use by personnel in critical areas 
special shoes that can be sterilized after 
use or to provide disposable covers of some 
type 

The handbng of babies within the nurserv 
requires special care All instruments used 
for examination should be kept in the 
nursery and sterilized between the cximina 
tion of the infants All blankets and linen 
must be laundered between uses and all 
bassinets must be satisfactorily treated be- 
tween occupancy Diapers and other arucles 
of clothing must be discarded into closed 
containers 

It is also of the utmost importance that 
formula preparation be completely super 
vised and in the hands of qualified indi 
viduols and that the laboratory be asked to 
do frequent stenlitv checks on randomly 
Selected samples AH equipment (autoclaves 
and refngerators for example) used in the 
preparation of formulas should be checked 
constantly to make sure they are function 
mg and being maintained properly 

In other critical areas such as operating 
and delivery rooms much the same prin 
clples apply as those for the nursery The 
same considerations applv to the wearing of 
gowais caps and masks and the same prob- 
lems exist with shoes There arc of course 
certain additional precautions that have to 
be taken routincl) It is desirable for all 
pt^sonncl to change shoes as ivelJ as other 
articles of clothing between operations The 
tj-pc of mask woni by operating room per

Sion and study Some recommend the use

these should be discarded at the end of the 
operation 

Smcc the dangers of Infection of surgical 
incisions and burns come not only from the 
well recognized pathogens but also from 
organisms of the normal bodj flora it Is of 
the utmost importance that a number of the 
same general precautions used in the op- 
erating room be taken in changing dress 
ings on nomnfected wounds The room in 
which the change is to be made shall be 
cleaned thoroughly and no one shall be 
allowed in the room for 30 minutes before 
the procedure is to be done This Is to allow 
all dust borne organisms to settle below the 
critical level Masks gowns caps and rub- 
ber gloves should be worn and the surgeon 
and nurse or other assistant should avoid 
unnecessary motion during llie period of 
removal and replacement of the dressing 

When enienng patients rooms or nurs

mcians must be required to observe the

fection was discussed Studies conducted 
under a vanety of curcumstanccs hare in- 
dicated that measures designed to reduce 
the bacterial content of the air ha\e a 
definite effect on the occurrence of certain 
tj’pes of infectious disease It seems obMous 
that dust presents the greatest problem, 
and It IS therefore essential that all measures 
be taken to reduce dust to a minimum and 
to a\oid sumng up the dust that already 
exists Thus, proper housekeepmg pro- 
cedures are of the utmost importance No 
dry mopping or dusting should ever be al- 
lowed All floor moppmg should be done 
with a suitable disinfectant in the water, 
and mop heads should be stenlired and not 
allowed to dry out m a mop closet It has 
been sbowm that oiUng of floors and blankets 
markedly reduces the hazard, presumably 
by trapping dust particles and preventing 
their resuspension in the air 

There are many sources of dust Clothing, 
hair, linens, blankets, and drapes are some 
of the most obnous Release of dust into 
the air is caused by many things, includmg 
air currents and movement When equip- 
ment, such as lights and x ray machines, 
is suspended over a patient during \anou$ 
procedures, there is aUva>s the danger that 
dust will be shaken off onto open lesions 
Thus, it IS well to keep such lesions pro 
tected by a suitable shield if at all possible, 
since it Is not always possible to clean 
complicated apparatus completely 

Reduction of the number of bacteria in 
the air can be accomplished in a number of 
ways that may be considered adjuncts to 
the routine general housekeeping Forced 
air ventilation, which brings in outside air 
and maintains a positive pressure m an 
enclosed space, may be used The effective- 
ness of such replacement depends upon 
the amount of air being brought mlo an 
area and tlie length of time required for 
complete replacement If forced air ven- 
tilation is used, the amount of outside air 
can be regulated, that is, 25 per cent of new 
air may brought in and 75 per cent may 
lie recirculated In critical areas, such as 
operating rooms, it is highly desirable that 
no air l>c recirculated and that all the air 
be brought in from the outside This air can 
be rendered highly pure b> inserting ade- 
quate devices, such as air filters and elec- 
tronic precipitators Various studies have 
shown that ultraviolet lighting placed 
strategically in entryways and in operaong 
rooms is effective in reducing bactcnal 
counts Ultraviolet rays, however, do not 
easily peneirate dust particles and droplets 
nor do they effectively penetrate blankets 


or linens Bactencidal aerosols of vanous 
types have been used under certain circum- 
stances and are fairly effective in reduang 
bactenal counts in the air. Such aerosols 
are limited in their effects on bactena by 
the type of material to which the bactena 
arc attached 

Air replacement and filtration arc the 
most effective means of reducing the bac- 
tenal content of the air Ultravuolet light 
and aerosols are less effective, and ultra- 
violet has the possible disadv aniage of creat- 
ing a false sense of secunty None of these 
methods can be substituted for good house 
keepmg This cannot be too strongly empha- 
sized 

Recently portable high intensity ultra- 
violet light sources have been developed and 
can be used to assist m tlie sterilization of 
rooms occupied by patients with infectious 
disease who have been discharged The 
efficacy of such bghts m destroying micro- 
organisms on relatively smooth and other- 
wise clean surfaces seems to be excellent 
They are not effective for mattresses, 
blankets, and drapes Such equipment may 
be used in lieu of scrubbing walls with 
disinfectant The routine use of such a 
light is highly desirable in autopsy rooms 
after normal cleaning following a post- 
monem examination of an infected patient 

The sterilization of articles that cannot be 
autoclaved presents a problem Such articles 
as shoes, rubber goods of certain types, and 
plastics can be sterilized effectively by using 
either ethylene oxide or beta propiohcionc 
There is now available specially constructed 
equipment for use with ethylene oxide, or 
one can convert a standard autoclave for 
the use of this gas This substance must be 
handled with care, however, since it Is 
highly toxic Being a vapor, beta proplolac- 
tone Is more effective in certain circum 
stances than ethylene oxide, since Its 
penetrating capacity is greater It may be 
used in the stenlizaiion of certain remotely 
located areas and rooms, provided these 
can be sealed tightly to prevent leakage of 
tlie vapor This v’apor is highly imtating to 
the eyes in low concentration, thus its 
presence in the atmosphere Is detected 
easily when leakage occurs Before using 
cither of these agents personnel should be- 
come thoroughly famihar wath their proper 
ties and dangers 

When an outbreak of disease occurs 
within any area of the hospital, extensive 
Investigation is indicated The micro- 
biologist and epidemiologist arc bound to 
play a major role in this investigation and 
should be consulted at the earliest possible

moment since as time passes it becomes 
more and more diflicult to determine sources 
of infection The course the investigation 
takes and the measures taken to prevent 
further spread will depend on the tnic of 
infection and the situation that exists 
Within the area or institution Involved 

One must attempt to determine whether 
carriers provide a continuous reservoir 
whether there is a single source such as 
food at a given meal and whether tliere 
are breaks in technique in the day to-day 
operation of the area involved Such infer 
mation may be derived in a number of vva>s 
such as a careful study of the nature and 
occurrence of the infections and the Isola

plete identification of the microorganism in

To take a specific example this is perhaps 
the only situation in which phage typing 
of Staphylococcus aureus can be justified at 
the present time If in outbreaks of staph 
jlococcal disease all or most ca<«s are 
caused by a single phage type (he search 
for a source of the outbreak can be nar

and Its source Is located the procedure for 
preventing recurrences should become 
obvious

doctors offices and oilier places where

parenteral inoculations are done Transmis 
Sion of this disease occurs when the scrum 
of a person carrying the virus is introduced 
into another person Because the minutest 
quantity of scrum is capable of transmitting 
the infection it is necessary to use extreme 
caution Stylets and inoculating needles 
pick up enough scrum to transmit the in 
fcction and cleaning these items with alco- 
hol between use is not sufficient to remove 
or destroy the virus Thus when a iccb 
nician Is doing finger punctures a mu 
sterilized stylet must be used for each pa 
tient When doing mass inoculations sucii 
as vaccination or tuberculin testing sep- 
arate syringes and needles must lie used for 
each individual It is not sufficient simply 
to change the needle and to use the syringe 
for more tiian one inoculation Syringes and 
needles must be thoroughly cleaned and 
sterilized between use Disposable synngLS 
and needles arc available and should be 
used if at all possible Transfusion is an 
other potent source of transmission and 
all possible precautions must be taken in 
the blood bank No person with a hision of 
jaundice should ever be used as a donor

long incubation period the consequences of 
carelessness may never come to the aiten

portant since the use of improper!) ster 
ilized equipment can lead to disastrous con 
sequences Detection of fault) sterilization 
performance can be accomplished bv the 
use of \anous mechamcal de\Tces Indi 
cators or culture tests Among the mechan 
ical devices designed to eliminate the 
inaccuracies of human error in stenbzer 
operations are recording thermometers 
indicating potenuometers and automatic 
time temperature controls Properly in 
stalled these dences undoubtedly consli 
tute a great safety factor and a substantial 
savTng in personnel time Such instruments 
are essential for use of the newer ethylene 
oxide or beta propiolactonc sterilizers 

The chemical or so-called “telltale” indi 
cators are widely used but seem to suffer 
from a general lack of uniformity and 
standardization (Eckcr 1937) Some indi 
cators react to a time temperature ratio 
madequate for sterilization or the end 
points are not sufficiently clear to permit 
accurate interpretation of the results 
(Reddish 1951 and Walter 1937) If 
used the) should be placed in the center of 
the largest and most closel) wrapped pack 
age m the load Papers printed Avith chem 
Icais that change color when adequate 
stenlizalion has presumably been accom 
pushed are useful for some purposes but 
should never be used as (he sole measure 
of control 

Culture tests are probabl) the methods of 
choice in eialuating the effeemeness of a 
stenlizmg process The only serious disad 
lantage is the delay in determining the re 
suits of culture tests One procedure is that 
of Ecker (1937) who used air dned and 
powdered garden soil made up in paper 
packages These packages are inserted m 
the center of the largest pack and cultured 
after sterilization has been completed 

Another procedure is to grow large 
quantities of spores of fi subtilis in a poor 
nutrient medium Squares of old linen 
(about 1 sq cm ) are spread out in Petn 
dishes and a drop of the suspension of the 
spores is placed on each They are dned m 
the incubator and placed in small envelopes 
The envelopes are placed m areas where the 
steam is least likely to penetrate in the auto- 
clave After sterilization the envelope is 
returned to the laboratory and the piece of 
Imen is removed under careful aseptic pre 
cautions and cultured in broth for 24 hours 
If the broth is clear at the end of this bme 
the test IS satisfactory 

Various types of bactcnal spore suspen 


sions are now available commercially These 
obviate the necessity for prepanng the sus 
pensions in (he individual laboratories and 
also have the advantage of using strains of 
bactena with known thermal resistance 
These are generally very satisfactory One 
(ype found to be convenient is a suspension 
of spores of Bacillus stearotheTmophilus 
which is suppbed in sealed ampules con 
taimng thioglycollate broth The ampules 
are placed in the autoclave in the same wa) 
as other controls and simply incubated un 
opened at 55 to 65® C Ampules showing no 
growth after 24 to 48 hours incubation 
indicate that stenlization has been properly 
accomplished provided the control ampule 
shows growth 

Sicrihzauon failures are tJie result of sev 
era! factors prmcipally 

1 Lack of basic Imowledge concerning 
the principles of operation and care of 
stenlizers 

2 Faultv equipment 

3 Failure to understand and observe the 
regulauon of the autoclave so as to main 
tarn a pressure of 15 to 17 lb equivalent to 
121 to 123® C 

4 Incorrect methods of packaging and 
wrapping maienal 

5 Carelessness in loading the sterilizer 
without due consideration of the necessity 
for prov iding for free circulation of steam 
throughout the load or for complete air re- 
moval 

6 Failure to time correctly the required 
period of exposure 

7 Failure to carry out the correct se- 
quence of operations in the sterilizing cycle 

8 Attempts to sterilize materials that 
are impervious to steam such as oils and 
talcum powder

Hospital Hpidemiolocy 833 


solution (pH 7 2) Into 6 oz wide mouth 
screw cap bottles Autoclave for 20 min 
utes at 121° C 

2 Prepare tubes of violet red bile agar 
according to the directions on the bottle of 
the dehydrated medium Each tube should 
contain 12 to 15 ml of agar No autoclaving 
of this medium is necessary and may be 
detrimental 

3 Prepare tubes of plate count agar 
(tryptone ^ucose extract or milk protein 
hydrolysate) accordmg to the directions on 
the bottle of the dehydrated medium Each 
tube should contain 32 to 15 ml of agar 
Sterilize m the autoclave at 121° C for 20 
minutes 

Procedure 

1 Remove the mpple from the nurs 
ing bottle usmg sterile forceps and place 
m a bottle of phosphate buffer Shake 
bottle and mpple ^^go^ousIy about 25 times 
in 7 seconds 

2 Transfer 1 0 ml of the moculated 
ddutjon water to each of two sterile Pctn 
dishes using a stenie 1 0 ml milk dilution 
pipet 

3 To one dish add a tube of melted 
violet red bile agar cooled to 45° C mix 
and allow to solidify The sohdiiied agar is 
then covered with 4 to 5 ml of additional 
melted medium Into the other inoculated 
Petn dish pour the contents of a tube of 
melted and cooled plate count agar and 
mix 

4 Invert the Petri dishes after the agar 
has solidified and incubate at 37° C The 
violet red bile agar plates are incubated for 
24 hours and tlie plate count agar for 48 
hours 

5 After the completion of liie incu 
bation period examine plates carefully for 
the presence of colonies usmg a Quebec 
colony counter or similar device Brick red 
colomes at least 0 5 mm in diameter ap 
pcanng on the vnolet red bile agar plates 
are considered as coliforms Count each of 
these colonies multiply by 50 and report 
this number as coliform count per nipple ” 
The accepted standard is 0 colonies Count 
the total number of colonies appearing on 
the plate count agar dish multiply by 50 
and report as total colony count per nipple ” 
The maximum bacterial count allowed is 
less than 25 colonies per nipple 

II Examination of the Formula 

1 Invert the contents of the bottle 
thoroughly until the contents are Iiomog 
enous before removing a sample 

2 Usmg a stenie milk transfer pipet 


transfer I 0 ml of the formula to the hot 
tom of each of two sterile Petri dishes 

3 Into one Petn dish pour violet red bile 
agar and into the other pour plate count 
agar as described m the rinse test (step 3) 
Incubate and examine Petn dishes as cx 
plained previously (step 4) and report as 
coliform count per ml and total colonv 
count per ml" of formula The accepted 
bactenal standard for formula is 0 coli 
form organisms and less than 25 colonies 
per ml 

Testing for Stenluy of Ulood and Plasma 
from the Blood Bank 

Plasma must be checked carefully to as 
sure freedom from bacterial contaminauon 
Bank blood is occasionally contaminated 
even under the best of condiUons and has 
been shown to have caused senous or even 
fatal transfusion rcacuons 

Plasma 

1 Inoculate three tubes of fluid thio* 
glycoUate medium (conforming to N I H 
specifications) with a sample of plasma 
using sterile equipment and careful tcch 
nique The volume of broth u^ed should be 
at least 15 times the volume of the inocu 
lum Incubate the broth as follows one 
tube at 37° C one at room temperature 
(22 to 2o° C ) and one at refrigerator 
temperature (5 to 10° C ) 

2 Examine cultures dally for evidence of 
growth for at least ten days If the lest 
matenal renders the medium so turbid that 
bacterial growth cannot be recognized 
easily transfers should be made to fresh 
tubes of medium at the end of three days 
of incubation Gram stains and subcultures 
should be made if any suspicion of growth 
appears at the end of the incubation period 
Any orgamsm isolated should be identified 
as completely as possible 

Bank Blood 

The organisms most likely to be found 
in blood that has been contaminated and 
their optimal temperature requirements for 
growth are 

Pseudomonas sp (2 to 30° C ) 
Achromobacter sp (20 to 37° C ) 
Coliform and paracolon LacUll (2 to 
37° C > 

Aerobic and anaerobic diphtheroids 
(20 to 37° C ) 

Staphylococci (30 to 37° C ) 

Consequently cultures should be made at 
three dilTercni temperatures as for plasma

1 Inoculate 1 ml in each of three tubes 
of thioglycoZIate medium and add i ml to 
the bottom of three Petn dishes Add tubes 
of melted and cooled infusion or thioglycol

same time make a gram stain of the blood 

2 The tubes and plates are incubated for 
at least ten days before discarding as nega

liacleriologic Exnminalton of food Uteimh 

Bactenologic examination of swabs taken 
from washed utensds is an important check 
on the adequacy of dishwashing techniques 
and apparatus The techmque consists of 
swabbmg the essential surface of the uten 
sils to be examined, immersing the swab m 
diluting fluid, and culturing by standard 
procedures to determme total numbers of 
bacteria and coliforms 

Technique A sterile, absorbent cotton 
sivab IS dipped in stenie buffered distilled 
water, the excess fluid is squeezed out 
against the side of the container and then 
rubbed bnskly o\er the whole of the appro* 
pnate areas 

The inner surface of plates and bowls 
that would come in contact with food 
over an area of approximately 4 square 
inches 

The inner and outer surfaces of cups, 
mugs, and glasses to a depth of 0 5 cm 
below the nm 

The mner and outer surfaces of spoons 
and kmies 

The back and front surfaces and be 
tween the tines of forks 
Each swab is used for fi\e similar arucles 
Care should be taken to prevent contamina 
lion by handling dunng sampling 

A greater recovery of organisms can be 
obtained if calcium alginate swabs are used 
rather than cotton (Higgins, 1950) The 
ad\antages are that cotton frequently con- 
tains substances that are toxic for the more 
fasudious strains of bacteria and also that 
the alginate swabs can be dissolved com 
pletely m buffered water contamlng sodium 
liexamctaphosphate (NaP 03 )a In this way 
all the bactena contained in the swab are 
liberated into the solution 

If cotton swabs have been used, the swab 
is broken off the wooden stick with a sterile 
forceps and allowed to drop into a screw 
cap jar containmg 10 ml of swabbing solu 


tion * The containers must be kept cold 
and cultured withm four hours The bottle 
is shaken vigorously about 50 times and 1 
ml of buffered water is added to the bot 
tom of each Petn dish, and a tube of 10 mL 
melted and cooled plate count agar is added 
(see p 819) The plates are incubated for 
48 hours at 37® C The results are reported 
as the average plate counts of organisms re- 
moved per utensil examined 

If the alginate swabs are used, two suabs 
should be employed for each test, one being 
moistened in buffered water before use and 
the other kept dry The surfaces of five 
arucles are rubbed, first with the moistened 
swab and then with the dry one Both 
swabs are then broken off mto buffered 
water solution One miUiLter of stenie 10 
per cent sodium metaphosphate is then 
added, and the bottle is shaken until both 
swabs ha\ e dissolved Plate counts are 
then done on the solutions as desenbed 
previously If desired, pour plates can be 
made with violet red bile agar for coliforms 
or with blood agar for pyogenic cocci 

The U S Pubbe Health Service standard, 
based on the swabbmg and standard plate 
count technique, allows a maximum of 100 
colomes per utensil cultured Higher counts 
are presumptive evidence of Inadequate 
cleansing or aniibactenal treatment or of 
recontammation by handling or during 
storage Judgment should be made on the 
basis of repeated sampling

Serodiagnostic Tests for 


Syphilis 


By JAMES G. SHAFFER, Sc.D., and MILTON GOLDIN. M.S. 


The purpose of all serologic tests for 
syphilis is to detect in the serum of patients 
wth this disease antibodies against Trepo- 
nema pallidwn or antibody-like substances 
known as "reagins.*’ The fost serologic lest 
for syphilis was developed in 1906 by Was* 
sermann and his colleagues, who applied 
the recently discovered principles of com- 
plement fixation. Tests used at the present 
time are of three main types— those based 
on the complement-fixation reaction, those 
based on the principle of flocculation, and 
those intended to detect what appear to be 
specific antitreponemal antibodies, utilizing 
living or dead T. pallidum suspensions. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

The first principle to keep in mind in rela- 
tion to serodiagnostic tests tor syphilis is 
that the accepted procedures carefully 
worked out by the authors of the respective 
tests must be adlicred to rigidly and that no 
arbitrary changes in technique are to be 
Introduced. The techniques described in this 
chapter follow in detail the latest presenta- 
tions by the originators of each test as 
described in the manual, "Serologic Tests 
for Syphilis” (1959). 

Although serologic tests for sypJiilis are 
not absolutely specific and some serums and 
spinal fluids may react positively in one test 
and negatively in another, interpretation of 
conflicting serologic results in terms of diag- 
nosis or prognosis should not be made by 
the laboratory technician. These decisions 
are ^vithin the province of tlie -physician. 
Valid serologic test findings arc obtained 
when standardized reagents and adequate 


controls arc used, when techniques recom- 
mended for each method are adhered to 
strictly, and when results are reported as 
specified for eacli procedure. 

The technician should test every new lot 
of a reagent in parallel with one that has 
been tried and is being used arid that has 
been shotvn to possess acceptable reactivity 
before the new lot of the reagent is placed 
in routine use. This procedure is recom- 
mended regardless of the source from whicli 
the new reagent is obtained Other factors 
10 be considered in the control of serologic 
tests arc discussed in the following sections. 

Equipment 

\Vaier-h3th shovJti be 

checked each time the baths are used. The 
refrigerator temperature should be checked 
daily with a thermometer placed in the part 
of the refrigerator occupied by the test 
racks. Temperature should also be noted 
when the refrigerator is first opened in the 
morning if complemcnt-fixadon tests (16- 
to-18 hour fixation) are stored within. 

The speeds of shaking and rotating ma- 
chines should be cheeked by the technician 
each time they arc used, and marked varia- 
tions from prescribed speeds should not be 
tolerated. 

Centrifuges should be equipped with 
tachometers so that speeds may be chocked 
and controlled. Tlic inside of centrifuges 
should be cleaned frequently to prevent dust 
particles from being blow-n into specimens 

Automatic pipetting machines should be 
checked dally for correct volume dcUverj’. 
Should readjustment be found necessary".

and then treated as new shdes Slides should 
be handled by the edges while cleaning to 
prevent greasy fingerprints on the testing 
surfaces Serums will spread within the 
circles on clean shdes Failure of the serums 
to spread is an indication that the shde is 
unclean and therefore should not be used

Antigens All the nontreponemal tests for 
syphilis descnbed herein uuhze cardiobpm 
lecithin antigens with the excepuon of the 
Kahn procedures Cardiobpm is a non mtro- 
genous phosphohpid which is thought to 
be the active principle of the beef heart ex 
tracts used originally in the preparation of 
antigen As a rule it is more practical and 
economical to purchase these antigens 
rather than to attempt to prepare them indi 
vidually Each new lot of antigen should be 
tested in parallel with one that Is being 
used and should produce reactions in quail 
tative and quantitative tests with serum and 
spinal fluid that are comparable with those 
obtained with a standard antigen Parallel 
testing should be earned out on more than 
one day, and the differences m reactivity 
between the two antigens being tested 
should not be greater than those obtained 
with dupbeate emulsions of the standard 
antigen 

It is of paramount importance that anti

gen be stored at its recommended tempera- 
ture and that the diluted antigen be used 
only as long as is recommended 

The standardization and preparation of 
the antigens for the respective tests are not 
descnbed here, full descriptions of this pro- 
cedure will be found in the references 

Disitlicd ^\'’ate^ Distilled water of poor 
quality may result from failure to clean 
the still or the bottle trap as frequently as 
needed The land of tap water used and the 
number of hours per day that the still is in 
operation will cletermine the frequency of 
cleaning ^Vhen a bottle or tank trap is at 
tached to the water still, attention should 
also be given to keeping this section clean 

Distilled water will absorb ions of alkaline 
or acid gases present in the laboratory and 
may in this way become unsatisfactory for 
use in serologic tests For this reason the 
use of freshly distilled water is recom 
mended 

Saline solutions and distilled water, if 
stored, should be placed in hard glass con 
tamers that are tightly stoppered to avoid 
changes owing to ion transfer from the glass 
or from absorption from the air 

Saline Solutions. Sodium chloride for use 
m sabne solutions should be dried in the 
hot air oven for 30 minutes at IGO® to 180* 
C to remove absorbed moisture Heating at 
higher temperatures should be avoided, 
since II may result in decomposition of the 
salt The sodium chloride may then be 
weighed and stored m corked test tubes to 
avoid daily weigliing Dissolve salts in dis 
tilled water Shake the solution thoroughly 
to assure complete mixing 

Chemicals Chemicals such as sodium 
chlonde and cholesterol should be of re- 
agent quality and should meet the specifica 
lions of the techmque of the procedure 
Invahd results may be obtained when sub- 
standard chemicals are employed The re- 
agent containers should be tightly covered 
and properly stored 

Reporting Results of Serologic Tests 

Hie use of new terminology for reporting 
results of Serologic tests for syphilis was 
recommended in the 1053 report of the 
National Advisory Serology Council to the 
Surgeon General of die U S Public Health 
Service The new system provides uniform 
ity of reporting and avoids diagnostic 
connotations In accordance v\|th these 
recommendations the terms rcactiie, 
ueakly reactsie, and nonreactive are being 



SCRODIAGVOSTIC TeSTS FOR SVPIIILIS

substituted for the terms positeue ivcally 
positive or doubtful and negative in re 
porting test results 

In reporting results of quantitatue reac 
tions it IS recommended that the endpoint 
titer be reported m terms of the greatest 
diluUon in winch the tested specimen pro 
duces a reactive (positive) result and that 
the term dils a contraction of the word 
dilunon be used to identify these dilution 
reactivity endpoints By this means reac 
tions of identical intensity will receive the 
same report in terms of dils when different 
testing methods are employed 

Control of Test Perfomiancc 

Some of the factors that influence test 
performance have already been desenbed 
Jn addition Inter and intralaboratory checks 
are strongly recommended 

These include the daily use of controls 
of graded reactivity penodic check readings 
to maintain umfonn reading levels among 
the laboratory personnel and comparison 
of results obtained on control serums with 
those of a reference laboratory 
Serum controls should be included m 
each run of all serum testing procedures 
With slide fiocculation tests each prepara 
tion of antigen emulsion should first be 


examined with these control serums In 
other instances these controls should be 
included in the test run The results ob 
tained with the controls should reproduce 
an established pattern of reactivity In the 
event that these results are not acceptable 
further testing should be delayed until the 
optimal reactivity has been reestablished 

Serum controls of graded reactivity may 
be prepared in the follovvmg manner 

1 Collect serums givang reactive (not 
weakly reactive) reactions in dady test runs 
in containers suitable for storage by freez 
ing Collect nonreactivc serums in a similar 
manner Do not include anticomplementary 
serums if control serum is to be used in 
complement fixation tests 

2 Store the pooled serums in a deep 
freeze umt or in the freezing compartment 
of a refrigerator 

3 When control serums are to be pre 
pared allow the frozen serums to thaw at 
room temperature or jn the 37* C water 
bath 

4 Filler the pools of serums through a 
Seitz filter to remove particles 

5 Measure the serum in each pool and 
add 1 mg of Merthlolate powder* for each 
milliliter of serum

similar to the one outbned in Table 23-1 
may be selected 

7 Perform all the tests regularly em- 
ployed in the laboratory on these scrum

8 Select for control serums a dilution 
that IS reactive or 4+ in all tests and one or 
more dilutions that show intermediate re- 
acUvity If several tests are employed, two 
or more dilutions may be required to obtain 
critical readings in all tests 

9 Calculate the amount of each serum 
diluUon to be prepared This vviU be deter- 
mmed by the quantity needed for each day s 
testing, the penod of time during which 
the controls will be used, and the type of 
storage facilities available Control serums, 
properly stoppered, may be stored for ap- 
proximately 60 days in a deep-freeze umt, 
30 days in the freezing compartment of a 
refrigerator, and 7 to 10 days in a liquid 
state in a refrigerator 

10 Prepare the calculated volumes of 
each serum dilution and mix thoroughly 

11 Retest each serum mixture in all the 
tests in which it is to be used as a control 

12 Dispense aliquots of each button 
sufficient lor one testing penod into prop- 
erly labeled tubes and stopper tightly with 
parafTin coated corks Arrange in sets and 
refrigerate After 24 hours reset the corks 
and seal with plastic seals or adhesive tape 
as further protection against evaporauon 
and place in freezer 

13 For daily use remove one set of con 
irols from storage thaw at room tempera 
ture mix thoroughly, centrifuge, decant 
serum, and heat for 30 minutes at 55® C 

14 New lots of control serums should 
be tested m parallel with the one currently 
m use The pattern of reactivity should be 
established before they are placed into rou 
tine use 

Collection and Handling of Specimens 

Blood should be drawn before meals and 
placed in a clean dry test tube Since alco- 
hol in the blood diminishes the Intensity of 
reaction, 24 hours should be allowed to 
elapse after a period of alcoholic inebria 
tlon before taking the specimen If the 
specimen is to be mailed, the equipment 
used should be sterile, the blcxx! is allowed 
to clot at room temperature and placed In 
the refrigerator until read} to be tested 
The clot Is separated from the wall of the 
tube with a wooden applicator stick and the 


tubes centnfuged for 10 to 15 minutes at 
1800 rpm The serum is separated from 
the clots with capillary pipets into properly 
labeled test tubes Careful labeling and 
handling of specimens are essenual to pre 
vent errors 

For children or when vempunctures can 
not be performed, sufficient blood may be 
obtained by fingertip puncture A capillary 
tube, such as that used in microchemicaJ 
procedures, can be used The free end is 
sealed in a flame, the clot broken with a fine 
wire, and the tube centrifuged for a few 
minutes Sufficient serum can then be de- 
canted with a micropipet for a Kline or 
VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Labora 
tory) or similar test 

Tbe serum must be clear and free of 
suspended particles or red cells Excessive 
hemolysis can cause anticomplementary re 
acuons in the complement fixation tests 
Excessive chyle or bile may interfere with 
reading the reactions 

Serum is inactivated before testing to 
remove the native complement, to destroy 
certam lieat labile anticomplementary sub 
stances that may be present, and to stabilize 
the serologic properties of the serum This 
IS done by heating the serum In the water 
bath at 56® C for 30 minutes Previously 
heated serum must be reheated at 56® C 
for 5 minutes Alternatively the serum may 
be heated for 4 mmutes at 61 to 62® C , 
but this procedure is not ordinarily recom 
mended because of the danger of coagulat 
ing the serum 

Spinal fluid does not usually require in 
activation but if it contains gross blood or 
IS older than three days it is necessary (o 
heat for 15 minutes at 56® C 


FALSE POSITIVE SEROLOGIC TESTS 
FOR S\PH1L1S 

Although the serologic tests now in use 
have a high degree of specifiaty, a positive 
reaction does not necessarily prove that 
the patient has syphilis but merely indicates 
that, by the procedure used, a reagln or 
substance reacting with the antigen is 
present 

Even with the so-called "specific” trepo- 
nemal tests reactions are occasionally ob- 
tained in individuals who have no evidence 
whatever of syphilitic infection either past 
or present The problem of dlffcrentlaung 
a true positive from a false positive reaction 
can he exceedingly complex, and while the 
treponemal tests have been of great vdlue, 
much danfication is still need^

False positives can be grouped into three 
main categories those owing to technical 
errors, which can be controlled easily by 
close adherence to the accepted procedure, 
those owing to mtercurrent diseases or in 
fections and those found m certain uidi 
viduals who by e\ery measurable standard 
have no disease enuty that could account 
for the reactions obtained These are the 
so-called “biologic reactors” and ace the most 
perplexing group 

It has been Imoim for a long time that a 
wide variety of conditions unrelated to syph 
lbs can give false positive reactions Table 
28-2 bsts the approximate percentage of 
false positive serologic tests for syphibs 
obtained in certain conditions 

Infants showing positive serologic reac 


uons owing to passive transfer of rtagin 
from syphilitic motliers usually show nega 
live reactions withm four months after 
birth 

If serologic reactions are encountered 
that are bebeved to be false positives it Is 
necessary to check all reagents carefully 
to repeat the tests using other techniques 
and to repeat the tests at three-to-six month 
intervals since positne reactions owing to 
acute diseases usuallj disappear spontane 
ously within this period If the positive 
reactions persist and no underlymg disease 
such as collagen disease or malana can be 
found, a treponemal test may be of great 
value in differentiating between a true and 
a false positive (p 877) 

The problems of the biologic false positiv e 
reactions emphasized a fact that is often 
forgotten, namely, that the most the sero- 
logic technician can be expected to do is to 
conduct the tests precfselj as described 
by the author serologists The final decision 
whether a positive reaction is due to syplubs 
is the responsibility of the physician

Reagents 

I'^a hn standard.a ntigen This antigen 
is an alcoholic extract of powdered beef

It should be serologically standardized by 
Comparison with an anugen of standard re 
activity Standardization of each new lot of 
antigen includes 

Deferminct/on of uter This represents 
the optimal amounts of antigen and saline 
required to prepare an antigen suspension 
that will show complete dispersion in saline 
and will reproduce the opalescence of the 
standard antigen The label should give the 
titer of the antigen 

Adjustment of reactivity level An antigen 
more reactive than the standard may be 
adjusted by the addition of cholesterohzed 
alcohol concentrated lecithm solution, or 
under reactive antigen An antigen less re 
active than the standard may be corrected 
by the addition of cholesterohzed alcohol. 
Sensitizing reagent, or over reactive antigen 

Comparative testing Each new lot of 
antigen should be tested m parallel with 
a standard antigen on reactive weakly re 
active, and nonreactive serums

Clinical Divgnosis by Laborator\ Methods 


Changes in antigen o\ving to aging are 
usually reflected m the appearance of the 
nonreactive tests If these reactions become 
too clear or if thej become cloudy the 
antigen should be retitrated and restandard 
ized The need for retitration or restandardi 
zation of this reagent occurs but rarely 
Such procedures should be earned out only 
by a laboratory qualified to make such 
adjustments 

2 Saline solution Weigh 9 0 gm of dned 
chemically pure sodium chlonde reagent 
quality for each liter of distilled water 
Dissolve salt in freshly distilled water 
Shake solution thoroughly to assure com 
plete mixing The pH of the 0 9 per cent 
sahne solution should not be less than 
5 5 nor more than 7 0 

Kahn Tests vvttii Serum 
Preparation of Scrums 

1 Separate serums from clotted blood 
by centnfugauon and by pipetting or de- 
canung 

2 Examine each serum for absolute clar 
Ity (freedom from cells or foreign particles) 
by holding tube in same position and light 
as for reading Kahn tests Do not report 
results with scrums not satisfactorily 
cleared 

3 Heat serums at 56® C for 30 minutes 

4 When retesting of the serum is re 
quired the serum is reheated at 5S® C 
for ten mmutes if an interval of more than 
two hours has elapsed from first heating 
period 

5 Re^amine each serum for freedom 
from particles and recentnfuge any serums 
not sausfactonly cleared 

Kahn Standard Qualitaln e Test w iih Serum 

1 Arrange test tubes m standard Kahn 
racks so that there are three tubes for each 
scrum to be tested including reactive 
serum nonreactive serum and saline con 
trols Number the first row of tubes to cor 
respond to the serums being tested 

2 Prepare standard antigen suspension 
as follows 

a Measure into an antigen suspen 
Sion vial the amount of salme solu 
tion according to titer required for 
the given amount of antigen 
b Measure into a second antigen sus 
pension vaal the necessary quantity 
of antigen Use a 1 0 ml pipet 

Note The titer on the bottle of the anti 
gen will slate the amount of salme solution 
that must be mixed with 1 0 ml of antigen 
m order to produce a suspension of standard 
reactivity Usually 1 0 nd of antigen makes 


sufficient suspension for 20 tests An 
amount of 2 0 ml of antigen may be used 
with the proportionate quantity of saline 
solution Less than 1 0 ml should not be 
used 

c Pour the salme solution into the 
antigen and without stopping pour 
the mixture back and forth 12 
times without allowing vials to 
dram during the mixing penod 
d Allow the antigen suspension to 
stand (“npen”) for 10 minutes be- 
fore using It The suspension should 
not be used after 30 minutes from 
the time of its preparation 

3 Place thumb over mouth of mixing 
vial and shake suspension briskly to sus- 
pend the Jipid aggregates 

4 Pipet 0 05 ml of antigen suspension 
directly to the bottom of each tube of the 
front row of the Kahn rack, employing a 
Kahn antigen suspension pipet 

5 Pipet 0 025 ml of antigen suspension 
directly to the bottom of each tube of the 
middle row of the Kahn rack 

6 Pipet 0 0125 ml of antigen suspension 
directly to the bottom of each tube of the 
back row of the Kahn rack- 

7 Add 0 15 ml of each serum to the 
designated set of three tubes containmg 
005 ml 0 025 ml . and 0 0125 ml of anti 
gen suspension respectively Note Com 
plete the addition of antigen suspension 
and serums to one rack before adding anti 
gen suspension and serums to another rack 

8 Shake rack by hand for ten seconds 
after anUgen suspension and scrum have 
been added to oU tubes m tliat rack 

9 Permit serum anUgen suspension mix 
ture to stand for three to seven minutes at 
room temperature 

10 Shake rack of tubes for three minutes 
on Kahn shaking machine 

11 Remove rack from shaking machine 
and add 1 0 ml of 0 9 per cent saline solu 
tion to each tube of the front row and 0 5 
ml of the salme solution to each tube of 
the middle and back rows Note Add saline 
solution to one rack and complete readings 
before adding salme solution to another 
rack 

12 Shake rack by hand gently for a few 
seconds to mix contents of tubes 

13 Read and record each tube of the rack 
one to two mmutes after the addition of the 
saline solution 

14 Reread each tube 15 minutes after the 
addition of the saline solution in all m 
stances In which a nonreactive result was 
not obtamed on the first reading

Control System for the Kahn Standard 

1 Reactive serum nonreactive scrum 
and saline solution controls should be em 
ployed for testing each anugen suspension 
before It is used in the regular tests with 
unknown serums 

2 The antigen suspension for the control 
tests IS pipetted immediately after it has 
aged for ten minutes After pipetung the 
serums and salme solution the tests are at 
once shaken for three minutes and the 
usual amounts of sohne solution added to 
the tubes before reading the results 

3 The antigen suspension should not be 
employed in the regular tests with serum 
or spinal fluid ff typically reactive and non 
reactive results are not obtained with the 
control serums and if the an*igen saline 
solution control tubes are not of the correct 
degree of opalescence and free from non 
dispersible aggregates Failure to obtain 
correct results in the control system may 
be due to faciois such as 

a Incorrectly prepared antigen sus 
pension 

b Use of antigen suspension that has 
aged more than 30 minutes after 
time of preparation 

c Use of antigen suspension that has 
not been allowed to age (“ripen ) 
for ten minutes after it has been 
prepared 

d Use of refrigerated or chilled anti 
gen and salme solution 


e Use of antigen that has undergone 
some change (such as prolonged 
exposure to hght) use of wet 
pipets loose capping of bottle and 
so forth 

Reading of Results 

1 Place a microscope mirror on the 
work table with the concave side upward 

2 Adjust a reading lamp (dajhght bulb 
or fluorescent tube) above the mirror so 
that the bulb image is not visible but so 
that the tube is held within the cone of 
light 

3 Place each tube to be read in a nearly 
horizontal position holding it about J to 2 
inches above the mirror 

4 View the image of the tube contents in 
the mirror and note degree of flocculation

8. Consider as reactive a 3+ or 4+ read- 
ing in any of the three tubes. 

Kahn Standard Quantitathe Test with 
Serum 

Quantitative tests are performed on all 
serums that are 4+ or 34- reactive results in 
the Kahn standard qualitative test. 

1. Prepare serum dilutions of 1:2, 1:4, 
1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, and higher if neces- 
sary in the folloiving manner: 

a. Pipet into each of five (or more) 
tubes 0.5 ml. of 0.9 pet cent saline 
solution. 

b. Add 0.5 ml. of heated serum to the 
first tube and mix welL 

c. Transfer 0.5 ml. from the first tube 
to the second tube and mix well. 

d. Continue transferring and mixing 
from one tube to the next until all 
dilutions have been made. Allow 
the mixing pipet to remain in the 
last tube. Note.- Serum dilutions 

should be prepared and tested ^vithln two 
hoxurs of the heating or reheating of the 
undiluted serum. 

2. Prepare antigen suspension as previ- 
ously described under "Kahn Standard 
Qualitative Test with Scrum" (p. 846) by 
mixing Kahn standard antigen \vith 0.9 
per cent saline solution. 

3. After the antigen suspension has stood 
10 minutes (but not more than 30 min- 
utes), place the thumb over the mouth of 
the mixing wal containing the suspension 
and shake \ial briskly to obtain a uniform 
suspension. 

4. Pipet 0.0125 ml. of antigen suspension 
into the bottom of five (or more) numbered 
Kahn tubes. 

5. Add 0.15 ml, of the 1:32 dilution of 
serum to the antigen suspension contained 
in tube 5. 

6. Add 0.15 ml. of the 2:16 dilution of 
serum to the antigen suspension contained 
in tube 4. 

7. Continue addition of 0.15 ml. of de- 
creasing dilutions of the serum to tubes 3. 
2, and 1, respectively. 

8. Shake rack by hand for ten seconds 
and then allow it to stand five minutes. 

9. Shake rack on a Kahn shaking ma- 
chine for three minutes. 

10. Remove rack from shaking machine 
and add O.S ml. of 0,9 per cent .saline solu 
tion to each tube. Note: Add saline solution 
to one rack and complete reading before 
adding saline solution to another rack. 


840 

11. Shake rack by hand a few seconds to 
mix contents of tubes. 

12. Read each tube of the rack one to two 
minutes after the addition of the 0.9 per 
cent saline solution. 

13. Note the titration endpoint, I e., the 
highest dilution of serum in which a 4-r. 
3+, or 2-i- reaction is obser\ed. 

14. Compute the quantitative liter by ap- 
plying the formula S = 4D, where S is the 
potency of the serum in terms of Kahn units 
and D is the highest dilution in which a 4-f , 

3- k, or 2+ reaction is obser\-cd. 

Examples 

a. If the highest dilution in wliich a 

4- k, 3-b, or 24- reaction is obser\'ed is 1 32, 
then S= 4 X 32 or 128 Kahn units 

b. If the highest dilution in \\hicii a 
4-I-, 3-I-, or 2-f- reaction is Qbser>’ed is 1 . 16, 
then S= 4 X 16 or 64 Kahn units. 

c. If a 4+, 3-!-, or 2+ reaction was not 
obser\‘ed in the 1:2 or higher dUuuons. 
then 4 X 3 (1 representing tube 3 of 
the standard test with imdUutcd serum that 
had given a reactive 4-i- or 34- result) or 4 
Kahn units. 

15. Report results both in tenns of Kahn 
units and the highest scrum dilution in 
which a 4-t-, 3+, or 2+ reaction is ob- 
served. 

Examples 

a. 128 Kahn Units (1:32 dilution) 

b. 64 Kahn Units (1 :1G dilution) 

c. 4 Kahn Units (I;! dilution)

(The globuhn precipitate will be found 
packed at the bottom of the tube ) 

7 Decant and discard supernatant fluid 
by inverung and rotatmg tube at the same 
time Cover the entire wall of the tube with 
the supernatant fluid to permit its even 
dramage thereby preventmg ammonium 
sulfate from crystallizing on tube wall 
Note In rare instances the amount of 
globuhn IS excessive In such cases do not 
decant the supernatant fluid but instead 
remove it with a capillary pipet 

8 Drain imerted tube for ten mmutes on 
filter paper tap tube gently and use a strip 
of filter paper to remove any remaiiung 
drops of supernatant fluid 

9 Add 0 15 ml of sahne solunon to 
globuhn precipitate holding point of pipet 
close to bottom of tube to avoid washing 
down any ammonium sulfate that may be 
adhenng near mouth of tube 

10 Tap base of tube gently to redissolve 
the globulm and examine the resulting con 
centrated globuhn solution for freedom from 
particles 

Note When the globulin does not com 
pletely dissolve m 0 15 ml of saline solu 
tion add 0 05 ml more sahne solution and 
shake tube gently If the globulin is still 
insoluble repeat with an additional 0 05 ml

hn will still be incompletely soluble m 
which case the clear globulin solution is 
separated from the insolub e protein by 
centrifugauon If centrifugation does not 
clear (he fluid a trace of talc or kaolin is 
then added to the mixture and the Cube is 
recentnfugated The clear supernatant fluid 
(which IS the globuhn solution) is removed 
with a capillary pipet and transferred to a 
clean tube it is then ready for lesUng with 
the anUgen suspension

tated from alcohol) in 100 ml. of absolute 
alcohol and store in glass-stopper bottle at 
room temperature. 

3. DistUled water. Distilled water suit- 
able for the Kline tests should have a pH 
of 6.0-6 8 and have a minimum of jiositive 
ions or other electrolytes. 

4. Sodium chloride solution (0.85 per 
cent). Add the requned amount of dry, re- 
agent quality sodium chloride (850 mg.) to 
100 ml of distilled water. This solution 
should preferably be prepared on the day 
of use. It may be satisfactory for as long as 
one week if kept in a clean glass-stopper 
bottle. 

Preparation of Serums 

1. Remove serums from clots by centri- 
fuging and pipetting or decanting. 

2. Heat serums in 56° C. water bath for 
30 minutes. When re-examination of the 
serum on another day is required, serum 
should be reheated at 56° C. for five 
minutes. 

3. Recentrifuge any serum in which vis- 
ible particles have formed during heating. 

Preparation of ParaiTin-Ring Slides 

1. Clean 2x3 inch glass slides. 

2. Place 12 paraiHn rings (14 mm. in 
diameter) on each slide, using a hand- 
operated or an electrically heated ringmak- 
ing machine. Paraffin or a mixture of two 
parts of paraffin and one part of petroleum, 
heated to about 120° C., may be used. Care 
shouid be exercised to produce rings of the 
prescribed diameter. 

Preparation of CNL Antigen Emulsion 

1. Pipel 0.85 ml of distilled water to the 
bottom of a 30 ml glass-stopper bottle. 

2. Add I 0 ml. of 1 per cent cholesterol 
solution. This is accomplished fay allowing 
the cholesterol solution to drop slowly (20 
seconds) from the pipet while the bottle, 
held at an angle, is vigorously and con- 
tinuously rotated on a flat surface. 

3. Continue rotation of the bottle for an 
additional 20 seconds 

4. Add 0.1 ml. of antigen against the side 
of the neck of the botUe from a 0.2 ml. 
pipet, avoiding the ground-glass area. 

5. Place stopper in bottle and shake 
vigorously for one minute, throwing fluid 
from bottom to stopper and back. 

6. Add 2.45 ml. of 0.85 per cent sodium 
chloride solution rapidly to the bottle and 
shake less vigorously for 30 seconds. 

The emulsion is now ready for use and. 
if refrigerated, may be used for 48 hours. 


Double quantities of antigen emulsion may 
be prepared in 30 ml. botUes. 

Preliminary Test with Scrum 

1. Check the delivery of the hypodermic 
needle (25-gauge attached to a glass 
syringe). Adjustments should be made so 
that approximately 140 drops are obtained 
(0.007 ml. per drop) from each milliliter of 
antigen emulsion. 

2. Complete tests with control serums of 
graded reactivity as described imder "Kline 
Standard Qualitative Test with Serum." 

3. Reactions with control serums should 
reproduce the reactivity pattern. The non- 
reactive serum should show complete dis- 
persion of antigen particles and the opti- 
mum number of pardcles per microscopic 
field. 


Kline Standard Qualitathe Test with Serum 

1. Pipet 0.05 ml. of heated serum into a 
paraffin ring on a glass slide. 

2. Add one drop (0.007 ml.) of antigen 
emulsion to each serum. 

3. Rotate slides on a rotating machine at 
180 r.pm. for four minutes. Note: When 
tests are performed in a hot, d^ climate, 
slides may be covered during rotation with 
a box lid containing a moistened blotter to 
prevent excess evaporation. 

4. Examine the reactions microscopically, 
employing a 100 x magnification. 

5. Report observed results in accordance 
with the following outline; 

a. Typical reactions. 

NonreactiTC Antigea particles 

dispersed, no 
cluxapuig. 

Weaily reacuve C— or 1-f) Antigen partides 
in small but 
definiteclumps. 

Reactive (2-f-, 3-I-, or 4+) Antigen particles 

in medium- 
sized or large 
. clumps. 


b. Atypical reactions. Atypical reac- 
tions are characterized by Irregular feathery 
clumping in which smaller clumps pre- 
dominate. Atypical reacting serums should 
be retested, in dilutions from I;2 to 1:64, 
as described under "Kline Standard Quan- 
titative Test with Serum." A reactive report 
is rendered if a reactive result is obtained 
with one or more serum dilutions.

tion into the bottom of a 30 ml bottle 

2 Measure 0 4 ml of cholesterolized 
antigen (reading from the bottom of the 
pipet) with a 1 ml pipet graduated to the 

tip 

3 Hold the bottle in the left hand and 
impart a rapid rotatmg motion to it as the 
antigen is being blown directly and at once 
into the saline solution from the pipet held 
in the nght hand 

4 Mix by drawing the suspension into 
the pipet and blowing out exactly six times 
returmng all the emulsion left in the pipet 
mto the last mixture 

5 Add 2 6 ml of the buffered saline solu 
tion cap the bottle and shake from bottom 
to top and back 50 times in 15 seconds 

6 The emulsion then is ready for imme 
diate use and continues usable for the en 
Ure day Shake antigen emulsion gently 
each time it is used 

Preliminary Testing of Antigen 
Emulsion 

1 Check delivery of the syringe or ob 
servation tube fitted with a 21 gauge needle 
When in a vertical position 0 01 ml of 
antigen suspension per drop should be de 
Uvered 

2 Test control serums of graded re 
activity and buffered saline solution as 
described under Mazzini Quahtaave Test 
with Serum The results obtained should 
reproduce the reactivity pattern previously 
estabhshed for these serums and should 
show complete dispersion of the antigen 
partictes iiT boch norrreacfrvu serum and 
buffered salme solution 

Mazzini Qualitative Test with Serum 

1 Pipet 0 03 ml of each serum mto a 
separate concavity 

2 Add one drop of antigen emulsion 
(0 01 ml ) to each serum 

3 Rotate slides on rotating machine for 
four minutes 

Note When employing a mechanical 
rotator the speed should be 160 to 180 ro- 
tations per minute If rotation is by hand 
circumscribe a 2 inch circle 120 times per 
minute 

4 Read each reaction microscopically

Temperature of buffered saline solution 
and antigen should be in the range of 23“ 
to 29° C at the time antigen emulsion is 
prepared 

Note Antigen is added drop by drop, but 
rapidly, so that approximately six seconds 
are allowed for each 0 5 ml of antigen 
Pipet tip should remam m upper third of 
bottle and rotation should not be vigorous 
enough to splash sahne solution onto pipet 
Proper speed of rotation is obtained when 
the outer edge of the bottle circumscribes 
a 2 inch diameter circle approximately three 
times per second 

3 Blow last drop of antigen from pipet 
without touchmg pipet to sahne solution 

4 Continue rotation of bottle for ten

5 Add 4 1 ml of buffered saline solution 
from 5 ml pipet 

6 Place top on bottle and shake from 
bottom to top and back approximately 30 
times in ten seconds 

7 Antigen emulsion then is ready for 
use and may be used during one day Double 
this amount of antigen emulsion may be 
prepared at one tune by using doubled 
quantities of antigen and saline solution 
A 10 ml pipet should then be used for de 
livenng the 8 2 ml volume of salme solu 
tion If larger quantities of antigen emul 
Sion are required, more than one mixture 
should be prepared These aliquots may then 
be tested and pooled 

Stabilized Antigen Emulsion If desired, 
YDRL antigen emulsion for use in all the 
VDRL tests may be stabilized by the addi 
Uon of benzoic acid The use of this 
stabilized emulsion makes it unnecessary 
to prepare fresh emulsions each day tests 
are performed

Tejtjng antigen-emulsion delivery needles 

1 It IS of primary importance that the 
proper amount of anugen emulsion be used 
and for this reason needle used each 
day should be checked Practice will allow 
rapid delivery of anugen emulsion, but care 
should be exercised to obtain drops of con 
slant size 

2 For use in the Shde Qualitative Test 
and Slide QuanUtative Test A, antigen emul 
Sion IS dispensed from a syringe fitted with 
an 18 gauge needle mthout point, nhich 
will deliver 60 drops of antigen emulsion 
per milhhter when the syringe and needle 
are held vertically 

3 For use in the Slide Quantitati\e Test 
B, antigen emulsion is dispensed from a 
syT-mge fitted with a 19 gauge needle with 
out pomt, whicli will deliver 75 drops of 
antigen emulsion per milliliter when synnge 
and needle are held vertically (Fig 23-3) 

4 AVhen allowed to stand anugen emul 
slon should be mixed gently before use by 
rotating the bottle 

Preliminary testing of antigen emulsion 

1 Each preparation of anugen emulsion 
should first be examined by testing scrums 
of known reactivity in the reactive weakly 
reactive, and nonreactive zones This is ac 
compUshed by the method described under 
“VDRL Slide Qualitative Test with Serum "

These tests should present typical results, 
and the size and number of antigen parucics 
in the nonreacti\ e scrum should be 
optimum 

2 Only those antigen emulsions that 
have produced the designated reactions in 
tests performed with control serums (re 
active, weakly reactive, and nonreacuve) 
should be used If antigen particles in the 
nonreactivc serum tests are too large the 
fault may be in the manner of preparing 
antigen emulsion although other factors 
may be responsible 

3 An unsatisfactory anugen emulsion 
should not be used

2 Zonal reactions owing to an excess 
of reactive scrum component arc recog’ 
nized by irregular dumping and the loosely 
bound characteristics of the clumps The 
usual reactive finding is characterized by 
large or small clumps of fairly uniform 
size Expcnence will allow difTcrentlailon 
to be made between this type of reaction 
and the zonal picture wherein large or small 
clumps may be Intermingled with free 
antigen particles A zonal reaction is re- 
ported as reactive In some Instances this 
zoning effect may be so pronounced that a 
weakly reactive result is produced by a very 
strongly reactive scnim It is therefore 
recomvxcndcd that all serums producing

Plasmacrtt (PCT) Test 

The plasmacnt test was originated m 
1959 by Andujar and Mazurek to utilize 
the plasma from microhematocnt capillary 
tubes The test is primarily intended as a 
rapid screening test and appears to be 
reasonably sensitive and specific. A similar 
reaction that has been well tested is the 
RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagm) lest of Port 
noy Carson and Smith (1957)

3 The mixtuie is promptly observed for 
clumpmg The results are reported as no 
clumping — nonreactiie or negative very 
slight clumpmg — veahly reactiie or doubt 
ful (the test should be repeated with 
another sample) moderate to marked

Preparation of Antigen EAtutsiov 

1 A solution of 10 ml of 10 per cent 
choline chloride m 0 85 per cent saline 
should be made when the emulsion is pre 
pared It should be kept refngeraled 

2 VDRL slide anugen is prepared as spec

after the 5 ml of antigen is ready it is 
centniuged vn a conical stainless tube to 
an angle centrifuge at approximately 2000 
g for 15 to 30 mmutes The supernatant 
flmd IS discarded and the emulsion of 
anUgen is resuspended by blowing 5 ml of 
10 per cent cholme chlonde in salme di 
rectly onto the sediment and then vigorously 
shnknng and tappmg the centrifuge tube m 
the hand 

3 The emulsion will keep several days m 
the refrigerator but should be warmed to

COMPLEMENT FLVATION TESTS FOR 
STTHILIS 

In 1894 Pfeiffer showed that when 


guinea pigs that had recovered from cholera 
were infected with Vtbno comma their 
serum possessed strongly bactenolyuc activ 
ity agamst this orgamsm When the guinea 
pig serum was heated this activity was 
lost Further studies showed that the bac 
tenolytic activity was due to two sub- 
stances one a heat resistant substance 
found only in the blood of an immune am 
mal and the other a heat sensitive (thermo- 
labile) substance present m the serum of 
nearly all warmblooded animals whether 
immune or not Ehrlich named these sub- 
stances “amboceptor and “complement” 
(or alexm), respectively The bacterium 
that mduced the immumty and against 
which the bactenoljtic activity was duected 
was called the antigen ” Accordmg to Ehr 
lich the bactenolytic power really resides 
m the complement the specific amboceptor 
merely serving as an mtermediate body or 
connecting link which binds the comple 
ment to a particular kind of bacterium and 
thus enables the complement to act When 
ever this umon of the three bodies takes 
place — whether within the bodj of an am 
mal or m a test tube— bactenolysis results 
If the appropriate amboceptor or bactenol 
ysm IS absent complement even if 
abundantly present cannot be bound to 
the bactena and hence does not attack 
them If on the other hand the comple- 
ment IS absent umon of the amboceptor 
and bactena does take place but bactenol 
ysis does not occur In such cases the 
baclena are said to be sensitoed and sub- 
sequent addition of complement will quickly 
bang about bactenolysis 

Substances other than bactena can act 
as voTOgens novably red blow! cdls ihe 
destrucuon of which is known as hemolysis 
The mechamsm is analogous to that de 
scnbed for bactenolysis Injecnon of 
washed erythrocytes from another species 
of animal induces the formation of hemo- 
lytic amboceptor or hemolysin which is 
capable of bmding complement to erythro- 
cytes of that species thus bnnging about 
their destruction 

^Vhen hemolysis Is carried out in vitro 
the process is easily followed by the un 
aided eje because of the liberation of hemo- 
glc^in from the damaged erythrocytes 
■When the reagents are first mixed the 
erythrocytes form an opaque reddish sus 
pension As hemolysis proceeds their hemo- 
globin diffuses out through the fluid which 
ev-entually assumes a clear transparent red 
color with no visible sediment If hemolj 
SIS does not occur the intact erythrocytes

slowly settle to the bottom, forming a red 
sediment with a clear, colorless super 
natant 

The part that the three substances play 
in hemolysis can be illustrated m the fol 
lowing Simplified diagram (Fig 23-5) 

In the apphcation of the complement 
fixation reaction the determination of the 
amboceptor present in the patients serum 
establishes the diagnosis of the correspond 
mg disease When the unknoivn serum is 
mixed ^vlth a specific- antigen and com 
plemenf in a test tube, one of two things 
wiU occur 


FOR Syphilis 855 

1 If the patient has the disease In 
question and if ins blood serum therefore 
contains the corresponding amboceptor

“fixed ’ to the antigen by the specific ambo- 
ceptor and no complement iviU be left in the 
free state 

2 If the patient s serum does not con

change to show what has taken place and

that \vill show whether the complement still

remains free This is done by adding sheep 
red blood cells and hemolytic amboceptw 
to these cells — “sensitized sheep c^s ** 
If free complement is present the hemo- 
l)tzc system is complete and the erythro- 
cytes ^ ill be hemolyzed If on the other 
hand the complement has been bound to 
the antigen b> the antibody hemolysis can 
not occur 

The phenomenon of complement fixation 
was applied to the serodiagnosis of syphihs 
b> ^^assermann Neisser and Bruch in 
1906 At first aqueous extracts of human 
syphihnc tissues were used as the antigen 
but shortly after it was found that alcohohc 
extracts of normal animal tissues could be 
used equally well Since the isolation of 
cardiohpin by Pangbom in 1941 the anu 
gens used in the complementfixation test 
for syphihs ivith the exception of the trepo- 
nemal tests usually contain cardiohpin 
lecithin and cholesterol in proper proper 
tions 

Since these antigens are not speafic for 
8;yphihs the reacuon is due to the presence 
m the scrum spinal fluid or body fluid of 
a substance designated as ^reagin^” which 
IS not a true antibody for T palhdum Con 
sequently while the reactions are btologi 
colly nonspecific they possess a remarkable 
degree of specifiaty from the pracucal pomt 
of new with the excepuons that have been 
discussed previously (p 842) 

The reacuon has been applied to the diag 
nosis of a wide variety of diseases besides 
syphihs — parasiuc mycouc viral nek 
ettsial and bactenal In many cases simpler 
procedures are av ailable or the reaction has 
not proved sufficiently reliable to be of 
value In other cases the complement fixa 
non reaction has considerable use these

CoHoction and Preservation of Sheep 
Blood Sheep cells mav be too resistant or 
(00 suscepublc to the hemolytic action of 
complement and hemolj sin Because the xe* 
acuvity level of a complementfixation test 
IS influenced by the quality of sheep cells 
emploved parucular attenuon should be 
given lo this test component Tlie effects 
of bacterial contamination on sheep cell 
rcacUvity are unpredictable and only 
aseptJcaiiy collected sheep blood in stcnle 
containers is recommended for use in com 
plement fixauon testing 

Red corpuscles from an occasional sheep 
will be found to be exceptionally resistant 
to the hemolytic action of complement and 
hemolysin WTienever blood from an un 
tested sheep is drawn comparauve com 
plement and amboceptor titrations should 
be made employing other sheep cells of 
acceptable quahiy 

Sheep cells are too fragile for use when 
a saline suspension of waslicd cells pre- 
scribed by a test lechmque shows any de- 
gree of hemolysis when stored overnight 
at 6* to 10® C 

The only recommended solution in either 
of these instances is to discard unsatisfa'^

of sheep blood Freshly collected sheep

blood should be refrigerated for 48 hours 
before being used. 

4. Hemolysin. Stock glycerinated (50 per 
cent) sheep red cell hemolysin can be stored 
at refrigerator temperature for long periods 
of time with little loss of reactivity. A more 
rapid lowering of titer will be noted in the 
diluted hemolysin solutions. When a marked 
drop in titer is found or if precipitate is 
seen in the diluted hemolysin, the reagent 
should be discarded and reprepared from 
stock hemolysin. 

A sudden drop In hemolysin titer may also 
be caused by the complement, sheep cells, 
or saline solutions used. Comparative tests 
should be made to determine which reagent 
is at fault. 

5. Complement serum. 

Preparation and Preservation of Com- 
plement. Guinea pig blood may possess less 
complement activity than the prescribed 
minimum or greater than the prescribed 
ma.ximum. Low complement titers may be 
caused by improper feeding or housing of 
guinea pigs or, most commonly, through 
loss of reactivity during storage of guinea 
pig scrum. Complement serum stored as 
liquid (with preservative added) at refrig- 
erator temperature or in the frozen state 
should be adequately protected from partial 
drying as a result of evaporation. Aliquots 
sufficient for one day’s use should be placed 
in containers to avoid complement destruc- 
tion owing to repeated thawing and refreez- 
Ing. 

Some technicians are deceived by restor- 
ing dehydrated complement serum to only 
one-half or two-thirds of the original serum 
volume and then omitting the serum con- 
centrauon factor when calculating comple- 
ment dilution. Substandard serum may be 
made to appear adequately reactive in this 
way. This practice, used to circumvent tech- 
nique restrictions, is to be discouraged. 

Individual guinea pig serums may pos- 
sess complement in higher titer than is 
optimum for some techniques. The pooling 
of serum from several guinea pigs will usu- 
ally avoid this condition. 

Cardiolipin-lecithin antigens are free of 
the fraction responsible for the nonspedOc 
fixation of complement at low temperature. 
Pretesting of guinea pig serums and the use 
of egg white is therefore omitted when 
this type of antigen Is employed. 

a. Cell-free guinea pig serum can be 
obtained by centrifuging the tubes of blood 
and decanting serum from the clots when 
the laboratory practice is to bleed guinea 
pigs the day before the complement-nation 


tests are performed. The serums from three 
or more guinea pigs should be pooled and 
returned to the refrigerator. 

b. Dehydrated complement serum 
should be restored to original serum volume 
by dissolving in the proper amount of buf- 
fered diluent or distilled water and storing 
in the refrigerator. 

c. Complement serum stored in the 
frozen state should be returned to liquid 
state by remaining at room temperature or 
at 37® C. only long enough to melt. Because 
the protein content of these serums ivill 
tend to collect at the bottom of the tube 
during thawing, tliesc tubes of serum should 
be adequately mixed by inversion and re- 
turned to the refrigerator (6° to 10° C.) 

Preparatioti 

1. Select three or more large, healthy, 
male guinea pigs. 

2. With a needle and syringe remove 5 
ml. of blood from the heart and place in 
individual tubes identified by number. 

3. After the blood has clotted at room 
temperature, ring with applicator suck and 
refngerate for at least one hour. 

4. Centrifuge and remove clear serum 
from the clot. 

5. Pool serums from all tubes, recentrl- 
fuge, and preserve. 

OR 

6. If animals are to be exsanguinated, 
stun to anesthetize, cut the external Jugu- 
lar veins, and collect blood in Petri dilshes 
or in 50 ml. centrifuge tubes. 

7. Allow clotting to take place for one 
hour at room temperature. 

8. Loosen clot from wall of container, 
and refrigerate for one to two hours. 

9. Decant and filter serum through gauze, 
centrifuge, pool clear serum, and presen'e. 

Preservation 

Method I. Dehydrate complement 
serum from the frozen state in vacuo by the 
lyophile Or cryochem methods. 

Method 2. Add an equal part of the 
following solution to the complement 
serum: 

Sodium aceute 12 gm. 

Boric acid 4 gm. 

Sterile distilled water 100 ml. 

For use dilute 1 ml. of the preserved 
complement serum with 14 ml. of saline 
solution to prepare a 1:30 dilution. Store 
in refrigerator. 

Method 3. Add I.O gm. of sodium 
chloride for every 10 ml. of guinea pig 
serum. Store in refrigerator.

Preparation of Serums 

1 Centrifuge blood specimens and sepa 
rate serum from the clot by pipetimg or 
decanting 

2 Heat serum at 56® C for 30 minutes 
Pre\iously heated serums should be re- 
heated for five mmutes at 56® C on day 
of testing 

3 Recentnfuge any serum m which 
visible particles have formed during heat 
mg 

Note If complement fixation reacuons of 
maximum sensitivity are desired m the 
Kolmer quantitative test it is necessary to 
remove the natural antisheep hemolysins 
from serums This may be accomplished in 
the following manner 

a Pipet 1 ml of each serum into a 
small (12 X 75 mm ) tube and place in the 
refrigerator for 15 or more minutes 

b Add one drop of washed, packed 
sheep red cells to each scrum and mix well 
c Return all tubes to the refngerator 
for 15 mmutes 

d All tubes then are centrifuged and 
the serums separated by decanting Avoid 
carrying over cell residue from side walls 
or bottom of tubes 

e These serums then are heated at 56® 
C for 30 minutes Previously heated, ab- 
sorbed serums should be reheated for ten 
minutes 

Preparation of Spinal Fluid 

1 Centrifuge and decant all spinal fluids 
to remove cellular and particulate debns

flask Ilinse the pipet The amount needed 
may be calculated from the number of tubes 
contammg antigen in the test and titrations 
The test dose constitutes 0 5 ml of the 
antigen dilution indicated on the label of 
the bottle — usually 1 150 

2 Antigen dilution is kept at room tern 
perature in a stoppered flask 

3 The diluted antigen should stand at 
room temperature for at least one hour 
before it is used

All serums and spinal fluids showingr in 
hibiuon of hemolysis m the control tube 
should be returned to the 37® C water 
bath for a period sufTicieni to complete one 
hour of secondary Incubation At the end 
of tills penod these tests are removed from

9 Complete the tests as indicated in para 
graphs 9 through 17 of the technique for 
the performance of the ‘ICoImer Qualitative 
Tests with Serum and Spinal nuid" (p 
872) 

Both qualitative and quantitative tests 
may be conducted in one half volume The 
amounts of complement antigen and other 
reagents needed are in this way reduced 


by half Some accuracy of operation may be 
sacrificed by usmg these reduced quantmes 
however smee the relative effects of 
measuring errors are increased Hemal} sw 
and complement are titrated at full volume 
as described for the regular test The per 
formance of the one-half volume tests is 
identical with the regular methods except 
that halved volumes of serum spinal fluid 
and reagents are used (Table 23-17) 

Preparation of Reading Standards 

1 Heat tubes of hemoglobin solution 
(saved from the titration or obtained from 
control tubes of current days tests) m tlie 
56® C water bath for five minutes 

2 Prepare a 1 6 dilution of 2 per cent 
corpuscle suspension by adding 5 ml of 
sahne solution to 1 ml of 2 per cent sus 
pension 

3 Prepare reading standards by mixing 
hemoglobin solution and cell suspension In 
the proportions given m Table 23-18 

4 Heading standards are prepared with 
one half volumes of cell suspension and 
hemoglobin soluuon when performing the 
one half volume tests 

Reading and Reporting Test Results 

1 All serum and spmal fluid controls 
should show complete hemolysis

TREPONEAf AL TESTS FOR S\ PHILIS 

The immunochemical nature of the anti 
body “reagin detected in syphilitic serums 
by the comentlonal serologic procedures is 
essentially unknown and the antigens em 
ployed are nonspecific Also the frequency 
of biologic false positive reactions as has 
previously been discussed, has stimulated a 
great deal of investigation leading to the 
definitive diagnosis of syphihs by the de- 
tection of antibody that is related directly 
to Treponema pallidum 

The major step in this direction was 
finally achieved by Nelson in 1947 and cul 
minated in the development of the Trepo 
nema Immobilization Test (T P I ) by Nel 
son and Mayer in 1949 Since that time it 
has been widely and cntically tested and 
found to be highly specific m the diagnosis 
of human syphilis Unfortunately the propa 
gallon of virulent T pallidum and its piep- 
aration for the tests are too complex for the 
average clinical laboratory and only labora 
tones especially equipped for this purpose 
can perform it For this reason many modi 


fications attempting to use killed trepone 
mas have been developed m order to make 
the test more practical 
Some of these are

[{filer Proletn Comldement ft\atton Test 

A significant advance in the field of 
treponemal antigens was achieved when a 
simple and inexpensive antigen was pre 
pared from the avirulent Reiter strain of T 
palhdum by DAllesandro (1953) and by 
Cannefax and Garson (1957) Comparative 
studies have revealed that the tests usmg 
this protein antigen in a complement fixa 
uon test (R P C F ) have given results com 
parable with the T P I or T P C F tests The 
antigen is prepared by powing the Reiter 
strain of T pallidum m a modified Brewers 
fluid thloglycoUate medium contaimng 
horse serum After incubation the trepone 
mas are washed frozen and thawed re 
peatedly and dialyzed agamst sahne The 
test IS earned out on sera or spinal fluids 
using a one fifth volume Kolmer technique

and record observed hemolysis as descnbed 
under ‘^Beading and Reporting Test Results" 
(p 874) except in those instances in which 
inhibition of hemolysis is noted in the con

longer than one hour secondary incubation) 
Record test results in accordance with Table

The sensitivity and reproducibility of the 
R P C F test are controlled by use of a posi 
uve control serum of known reactivity, and 
in this respect the test dt/Fers from die con 
vcntional Kolmer technique The secondary 
incubation period is dependent upon the 
tune necessary for the positive control serum 
to produce a predetermined pattern of re 
activ-ity The RPCF test should not be 
perfonned unless one includes a positive 
control serum of estabhshed reactivity for 
determining the duration of secondary incu 
bation A pattern of 4+, 2+, and negative 
can be established with proper dilutions of 
the standard serum

882 CuMCAL Diagnosis b> 

It js likely that before long as the R P C F 
antigen becomes more readily a%ailable it 
will replace the comentional Kolmer com 
plement fixation antigen It has been sug 
gested that an ideal approach to the sero- 
logic diagnosis of syphihs ivhich would 
lumt the need for the laborious and ex 
pensile T P I test is as follows 

1 A standard serologic test for syphihs 
(Kahn V D R L ) If the test is negaiue and 
there is no climcal endence or history of 
sjTJhihs the patient is considered non 
infected 

2 The RPC F done on indnrduals «ho 
are positne with a standard test If the 
RPCF IS posime treatment for sy-phihs 
IS indicated 

3 Patients with a positive standard test 
and negatiie RPCF tested by the TPI 
If the TPI IS negative the standard test 
is considered nonspecific If the TPI is 
posime this indicates past or present in 
feciion 

According to an extensive survey con 
ducted by the U S Public Health Service 
Serology Ev aluation Research Assembly 
(299&>I957) the continued wide use of a 
cardiolipm or hpoidal antigen of good sensi 
tivit) and specificity plus the supplementary 
use of a Reiter protein antigen test cither 
routinely on all specimens is recommended 
as a check on all reactive specimens or in 
questionable “false-posiuve" cases 

Of course with the rapid advances be 
ing made in the scrodiagnosis of syphilis 
this recommendation may be altered in the 
near future

Serodiagnostic Tests in Diseases 
Otker TKan Syphilis 


By JAMES G SHAFFER. ScD , and MILTON GOLDIN, M S 


Serologic reactions are employed In the diag 
sosis of man) bactenai parasitic nckett 
sial, and \'iral diseases Some of the tech 
niques are relati\ely simple and may be 
performed e\en in the smallest laboratory, 
others require special facilities A ^ anety of 
antigens are used They include livmg or 
heat killed bacterial suspensions such as 
those employed in the Widal test in typhoid 
fever, red blo^ cdls of animals or roan 
as in the ana streptol) sm O or cold ag 
glutmin titrations and inert particles such 
as collodion or poljst>Tene latex to which 
antigens are adsorbed In one way or 
another 

The process of agglutinaaon has been 
considered a two-step reacuon ^Vhen anti 
gen IS added to antiserum a phjsicochem 
ical combination occurs m which the 
anubod) is adsorbed on the surface of the 
antigen This first step is followed by ag 


glutinauon in the presence of an electrolyte 
(usually in physiologic sahne soluhon) In 
the absence of the electroljie only the first 
step occurs and there is no aggregation of 
the antibody-coated antigen The degree of 
agglutination is dependent on the quantity 
of antibod), the concentration of the anu 
gen the composition of the salt solution 
and the temperature of the reaction (Fig 
24-1 > 

Bacterial anagens exhibit one of two 
types of agglutination which depend on 
the presence or absence of flagellar ("H ) 
antigens “When H anagen is present the 
combmation with the ana H antibody pro- 
duces a floccular tjT>e of aggluOnalion evi 
dently the result of entan^ement of the 
fiageUac Tlus type of agglutination is easily 
broken up by %agorous shaking (Figs 24-2 
and 24-3)

THE ID VL RE \CTIO^ 

The Widal reaction for the diagnosis of 
t>'phoid and paratyphoid infections is widely 
used and while it is relaihcly simple to per 
form is subject to many pitfalls of per 
formance and interpretation 

A very high per cent (approximately 98 
per cent) of the pathogenic Salmonella 
occurring in the United States belong to 
fiv e main serologic groups differentiated on 
tlie basis of their O or somatic antigens 
which are stable These groups arc dcsig 
nated A B C (C, and C«) D and E The 
fl antigens of the Stilmonella exJiibft certain

photograph kindly supplied by Dr Adrianus Pijper ) 

variations as a result of which cultures may 
contain combinations of species and group 
speafic antigens Those containing only 
species specific antigens are said to be 
monophasic (Phase 1) and those with both 
are diphasic (Phase 2) (See Table 24-1 
and p 634 ) 

VJ antigens are surface antigens peculiar 
to S typhi and a few other strains of 
Soimonel/a AnUbodtes to the Vi antigen 
appear during tjphoid fetcr but tend to dis 
appear from the blood soon after recovery 
from the disease Their presence Is highly 
suggestive of current or recent infection 
These antibodies tend to persist in carriers 
disappeanng only after the carrier state no 
longer exists (Fig 24-5) 

Classically the Widal test was done using 
only Saimonefia paratyphi A S paratyphi B 
and 5 (ypht H and O suspensions as anti 
gens Since group A infections are rare in 
the United States and the other groups arc 
comparatively common it is best to use 
antigens of the other serologic groups as 
well Such antigens have recently become 
av lilable or can readily be prepared as will 
be described 

■nie test can be done by several methods

glass plate 

2 Shake the antigen bottle thoroughly 
and add a drop to each amount of serum, 
startmg wth the smallest amount and pro- 
ceeding to the largest The dropper used 
should deliver 0 03 ml of antigen per drop 

3 Mix, using a clean tootlipick for each

uorking to the largest After mixing lift the 
plate and slowly ult back and forth for two 
to three mmutes Read in a xaeiving box or 
against a fiat black background Do not 
allow mixtures to dry out 

4 Complete agglutination is read as 4-}-, 
75 per cent clumping as 3-f-, 50 per cent as 
2-f', and faint agglutination as 1+ The utcr

InterpTCtnlioH 

The mterpretation of the Widal reaction 
requires caution and must be done in the 
li^t of the clmical findings Many factors 
must be kept in mind, such as 

1 In regions where typhoid fever and 
Salmonella mfecuons are endemic, a high 
level of natural agglutinms may be present 
Also U must be kept in mind that cross 
reactions are common among all enteric 
bactena 

2 Anamnestic responses are encountered 
occasionally By this Is meant the phenom 
enon in which a nse m agglutimns to S 
typhi may occur in a person who has had a 
previous Infection or vaccmation but vvliose 
present illness may be unrelated to typhoid 
Such anamnestic responses may also be en 
countered vvith other agglutmation tests 

3 No appreciable immunologic response 
can be demonstrated in some individuals 
such as those with agammaglobulinemia 
leukemia and advanced carcinoma and in 
eluding persons without any disease that 
can serve as an explanition 

4 The stage of the disease is important 
in determining the significance of elevated 




Serodiacnostic Tests jn Diseases Other Than Syphilis 887 


uters of agglutinins Typhoid bacilli can 
be isolated from the blood, stools, and unne 
before the Widal test shows a positi\e re- 
action As the agglutimn titer increases the 
number of positive cultures decreases Only 
50 per cent of patients with typhoid fever 
give positive reactions within one weeh 
after infection, and the percentage of posi 
tive reactions increases until about 90 to 
95 per cent are positive after four weeks 
If the reaction remains positive for a jear 
or more, the patient may have become a 
chrome carrier In this case the Vi ag 
glutinins are usually elevated 

5 Antibiotic therapy , particularly if given 
early in the disease may depress the tiler 
of agglutinins It is best to draw a sample 
of blood for testing before specific therapy 
IS mstituted 

6 It would be virtually impossible to de 
termme the exact species of Salmonella 
responsible for an infection by means of this 
reaction since there are so many serotirpes 
already recogmzed However, by the use of 
the antigens now available, the 0 group can 
be usually ascertained For specific identifi 
cauon isolation of the orgamsms is essen 
tlal 

7 No one titer can be considered diag 
nostic for the reasons already mentioned 
In unvaccinated individuals an H or O titer 
of 1 ICO or higher is suggestive In vao 
cmated persons the H and 0 uters are 
usually elevated The O Uter disappears m 
tune but the 11 agglutuuns may persist for 
several years In either case the demonstra 
Uon of a rise in titer dunng convalescense 
is considerably more important than any 
smgle determination 


provided the test procedures and antigens 
are standardized 


Macroscopic Slide Test (Huddleston and 
Abel, 192S) 

This test IS a rapid and simple test pri 
manly of value for screening but the tube 
test (see following section) has been found 
to be more rehable and more accurate The 
technique is identical with that used for 
Salmonella (p 886) and will not be repeated 
here The antigen used is a concentrated 
suspension of Brucella abortus which is 
available commerciaEy This antigen serves 
to detect agglutinins produced by all three 
species of Brucella In the shde test the full 
senes of serum dilutions must be used 
since a high titered serum may show a 
marked prozone reaction (Fig 24-6) 

Test Tube Procedure 

It has been shown recently by the Brucel 
losis Committee of the National Research 
Council (Spink et al , 1054) that the pro- 
cedures and antigens previously used for 
aggluunation tests for brucellosis were fre* 
quently inconsistent and inaccurate They 
have recommended a new antigen that is 
prepared from a smooth strain of any of 
the three species of Brucella (B abortus, 
B mehteusis B sms) * The organism is 
grown on infusion agar, washed off with 
salme inacuvatcd by adding phenol or 
formalm and finally standardized turbidi 
metncaJly 

Procedure 

1 Set up a scries of ten small aggjutina 


\GGLUTINATION TESTS FOR 
BRUCELLOSIS (UNDULr\NT FEVER) 

Human brucellosis simulates many other 
diseases and chmeal diagnosis based on 
symptoms alone is difficult and often im 
jiossible For that reason laboratory con 
firmauon is required Isolation of the or 
ganisms from the patient is the only ab 
solute method but this is sometimes dif 
ficult especially if the number of organisms 
IS low or if optimal cultural techniques are 
not emploved (see p 641) Also if anti 
biotics have been administered the chances 
of isolating Brucella become even smaller 

If serologic diagnosis is done properly 
the test can be of considerable diagnostic 
aid The sUn test with bruccllergen has 
some \ alue as does the opsomc Index 
(p 812) but the aggluunation test is the 
most widely used and the most accurate

AGGLUTIN VTION TEST FOR 
TUL.VREMI V 

The aggluunauon test is the most wideU 
used and the most reliable procedure in 
the diagnosis of tularemia since PastcurcUa 
tularensis is difficult to isolate and the sUn 
test anugen (Foshay) is not generally avail 
able The antigen used is a killed saline sus- 
pension of P fiilarcns/s (Francis No 38) 
preserved with Merthiolatc No attempt 
should be made to prepare this antigen in 
a laboratory not specially designed for tliis 
purpose since the organism is liighlv in 
fectious 


Procedure 

1 Serial dilutions of scrum in saline are 
prepared in 0 5 ml amounts (see Tabic 
24-2) An equal quantity of anugen is then 
added The dilutions used range from 1 20 
to 1 !280 plus an antigen control tube If 
at all possible an anti P tularensis scrum 
of known liter should also be run as a 
control 

2 The lubes are shaken placed in a 

37° C water bath overnight and read for 
aggluunauon as m other tube agglutination 
tests Owing to the prolonged incubation 
period sedimentation of the unagglutinatcd 
antigen may occur but the sediment can 
be resuspended readily upon shaking Ag 
glutinated clumps of bacteria are broken 
up only with difficulty and the supernatant 
Rvnd aemaitvs tVeas The vii\w\ioiv of 

serum that gives definite clumping is re 
corded as the titer 


Interpretation 

Titers of 1 40 or less may be observed in 
uninfected Individuals A nsc in titer ob- 
tained In scrum samples tested at weekly 
Intervals after Infection is considerably 
more significant than any single titer Titers 
of 1 80 or higher usually appear during 
the second week of Illness and reach higher 
levels during the fourth to elghtli weeks 
Qevated titers mav persist for many years 
after infection A negative test docs not rule 
out tularemia and the clinical findings must 
be considered in establishing tlic diagnosis 
Cross agglutination reactions occasionally 
occur with Brucella and Proteus 0X19 
hence it is necessary to conduct parallel 



Sfrodugnosiic Tests in Diseases Other Than S\philis §80 


tests vnth all three antigens The scrum 
will generally react with the homologous 
antigen in the highest titer Prozone reac 
tions may occasionally be seen 

An excellent flocculating antigen for this 
lest has been reported by Hunter Burdoiff 
and Colbert ( 1 958 ) It consists of an extract 
of P Uilarensts adsorbed on cholesterol in 
the presence of lecithin Tests using this 
antigen appear to be sensitive and specific 
and no cross reaction occurs with serum 
from cases of brucellosis 

THE ^VEIL FELIX REACTION IN 
RICKETTSIAL DISEASES 

Weil and Felix in 1916 isolated a strain 
of Proteus from the urine of a patient with 
t>phus fever, which was agglutinated by 
the patient s serum and serum from other 
typhus fever patients but not by the serum 
of normal subjects The original strain of 
Well and Fehx wss a nonmottle or O strain 
designated as X19 thus "Proteus 0X19 
Later two additional strains 0X2 and OXK 
(Kingsbury) were found which proved use 
ful m serologic tests as aids in the diagnosis 
of various other rickettsial diseases 
The chemical nature of the antigens that 
participate in this reaction have not been 
completely determined but it has been 
shown that Proteus 0X19 and Rickettsia 
prou azeki the cause of t> phus fever share 
a common glucohpid antigen 
Although the reaction is nonspecific Us 
simplicity and the positive results that may 
be obtained as early as the second week of 
the disease warrant its use Specific com 
plemeni fixation methods for the nckettsinl 
diseases are considerably more satisfactory 
but also more laborious and expensive (p 
800) It is common procedure in some lab 
oratones to check any serum that reacts in 
the Weil Fehx test with the complement 
fixation reacuon Rickettsial agglutinations 
and hemagglutination procedures are also 
available but are not practical as yet for the 
clinical laboratory 

Procedure 

Antigens are prepared as follows Only 
a smooth nonmoule or O variant of Proteus 
IS used The tube antigen is prepared by 
washing the growth of 18 to-24 hour agar 
slant cultures with 0 85 per cent NaCi con 
taming 0 5 per cent formalin and by ad 
justing the turbidity to that of tube No 3 
of the McFarland nephelometer scale "nie 
rapid slide test antigens are prepared in 


a manner similar to that used for the O 
anugens of Salmonella (see p 885) 

Macroscopic Tube Test 

This is done asm the Widal reaction (see 
p 886) The tests and controls are incubated 
in the water bath at 37° C for two hours 
followed by refrigeration for 20 to 22 hours 

Rapid Slide Test 

This IS done m the same way as in the 
Widal reaction (see p 88G) Only the 0X19 
antigen is commonly used in the United 
States smee most of the nckettsial diseases 
encoxmtered in this country react with it 
The 0X2 and OXK antigens can of course 
be included in any test if deemed necessary 
Proper controls consisting of Joiown posilne 
and negative sera should always be in 
eluded 


Interpretation 

1 The typical response obtained wth 
suspensions of Proteus 0X19 0X2 and 
OXK are given in Table 24-4 It is notable 
that serums from patients with nckettsial 
pox and Q fever give negative Weil Fehx

uons cross reacuons waih other infections 
and prozones may be encountered In pa 
tients with recent or concurrent Proteiis 
infections the results of the agglutination 
lest may be imsleadmg 

5 As in other agglutination tests of 
similar nature no one titer can be con 
sidered as diagnostic Except In those indi 
wduajs who have been vaccinated or have 
lived m an area where the diseases are 
endemic a titer of 1 160 or more Is highly 
suggestive However a nse in antibody uicr 
demonstrated in two or more serums col 
lected at different stages of the disease is 
essential for the presumptive diagnosis of 
rickettsial diseases when the Weil Felix 
reaction is employed 

COLD \GGLUT1MNS 

The serum of most normal individuals 
has an anubody like substance that will 
cause the agglutination of group 0 human 
erythrocytes at temperatures between 0 
and 5® C This type of substance has been 
termed “cold aggluiimn " The agglutination 
IS reversible since erythrocytes clumped by 
cold agglutlmns disperse when warmed lo 
37° C Tliis is a good method for detecting 
true cold agglutination

suhicient to disperse red cells into solution 
Vigorous shaking will result m lower liters

are rarely seen except in primary atypical

RalJid Cold Agglutinin Test (Garrozi, 19^S) 

This reaction is a simple and rapid screen 
mg test for the presence of increased cold 
agglutinins It is particularly \aluable in 
children smce it can be done from finger 
tip blood 

Procedure 

Approximately 0 2 ml of blood obtained 
by fingertip or ear lobe puncture is allowed 
to run into 0 2 ml of 3 8 per cent tnsodium 
citT&te in a small (60 X 7 mm ) t<^t tube 
The tube is corked and then rubbed over 
the surface of the ice cube tray of a re- 
fngerator and left on its side in the tray 
for about 15 seconds The tube is then 
removed and holding it at the corked end 
to avoid warming is slowly rotated so that 
the blood citrate mixture runs gently over 
the chilled glass surface The presence of 
coarse floccular agglutinaaon is recorded as 
“positn e No agglutination or the presence 
of a fine granularity is recorded as nega 
tive " The tube is then warmed in the hand 
for a few seconds and re-examined to con 
firm that aU agglutination has disappeared 
A positive rapid test indicates a test tube 
dter of 1 64 or higher 

STREPTOCOCCUS MG 
AGGLUTINATION TEST 

Streptococcus NIG is a nonhemolyuc strep- 
tococcus which was first isolated from the 
lungs m fatal cases of primary atypical 
pneumoma It was later isolated from the 
upper respiratory tract of normal individu 
als and there is considerable doubt that it 
IS directly related to the disease However 
It has been found that many patients con 
valescent from primary atypical pneumoma 
have Increased agglutimns against (his or 
gamsm Although these agglutimns do not 
appear in all cases of tlus disease their 
detection m convalescent sera Is of value 
as an aid m its diagnosis The agglutimns 
against Streptococcus MG are not related to 
the cold hcmagglutmms just discussed Both 
cold agglutimns and antiStreptococcus MG 
titrations should be performed simuUane 
ously on sera collected at intervals whenever 
the disease is suspected 

Preparation of iitltgeii 

The antigen is prepared from smooth 
Streptococcus MG cultures Cultures arc 
grown in infusion broth for 16 to 18 hours 
washed three times with physiologic sahne 


and adjusted to a turbidity approximately 
equivalent to No 5 on the McFarland scale 
The suspensions are heated at 65° C for 
one hour and Merthiolate in a final con 
centration of l 10 000 is added as a pre 
servatue Such suspensions are satisfactory 
for use for approximately two weeks • 

Procedure 

1 Dilute unheated serum with saline as 
shown in Table 24-2 

2 Add 0 5 ml of the antigen suspension 
to each tube 

3 For each titration a similar senes 
should be set up usmg Streptococcus MG 
control antiserum 

4 Shake tubes thoroughly and incubate 
in the water bath for two hours at 37° C 
followed by 18 hours in the refrigerator at 
4“ C The tubes are then placed m the 
water bath at 37° C for two hours after 
which the tubes are read 

5 Complete agglutination wath a clear 
supernatant is read as a 4+ reaction large 
clumps and clear supernatant as 3-t- large 
clumps but incomplete clearing of the super 
natant as 2+ and small clumps with mcom 
plete clearing of the supernatant as H- The 
aggluunation uter is taken as the highest 
dilution of serum in which reactions of 1+ 
or more are observed 

InierpTetatton 

Titers of l 20 or more are found in 50 
to 80 per cent of cases of pnmary atypical 
pneumoma Elevated titers in normal mdi 
vaduals or those suffering from other con 
diUons are rare 

The demonstration of a fourfold or more 
increase durmg convalescence is more sig 
nificant than the titer of a single specimen 
hence serum samples should be tested peri 
odically during the course of the disease 
until late in convalescence The absence of 
Streptococcus MG agglutinins does not 
necessarily exclude primary atypical pneu 
moma Antibiotic therapy may also result in 
the failure of these agglutimns to be demon 
strable 

SEROLOGIC TESTS FOR

also In a \Mde variety of otlier diseases but 
are not so frequent The factors behave like 
antibodies in that the} produce agglutina 
tion of certain t} 7 )cs of substances They 
may actually be auioantibodies 

This agglutinating capacit} was first 
noted by Waaler in 1940 and again b) Hose 
in 1948 and from their studies has been 
developed the so-called “W aaler Rose” test 
The test has subsequently been considerably 
modified and improved and new tests de- 
veloped Among these new tests are the 
sensmzed sheep cell agglulmation test (Zift 
(1956) modification) the FII test of Heller 
et al (1954) the Rh sensitized human 
cell lest (Waller and Vaughan 1956) and 
many others The sources of these pro- 
cedures will be found in the references 
Tests that have been shown to be rapid 
and simple to perform have been developed 
using biologically inert particles coated with 
human gamma globulin 
The mechanisms of these reactions are 
basically similar Antibody or gamma globu 
Un coats red cells or inert particles which 
arc then agglutinitcd by serum containing 
the rheumatoid factors The rheumatoid 
factors have a specific afTinit} for gamma 
globulin or for a surface coated with gamma 
globulin The inhibition procedure depends 
on the presence in normal scrum of an In 
hibitor which is lacking in rheumatoid 
arthritis scrum since it is neutralized by 
small amounts of inherent rheumatoid fac 
tor Tlie inhibitor is tested by using a 
standard reactive rheumatoid arthritis 
scrum and noting the drop in titer that 
occurs after the addition of the scrum 
containing the inhibitor 

The inhibitors may cause inconsistent 
results in the various serologic tests and 
have led some workers to employ euglobu 
Im or gamma globulin fractions rather than 
the whole scrum for measuring the rlicu 
matoid factors Among the many modifica 
lions the ones to be described have been 
used widely and successfully

Reading of Results 
A reaction is regarded as 4-f when all the 
sensitized particles are clumped vn separate 
masses There may be a few large or a 
number of small clumps depending on the 
titer of the serum Nevertheless the fields 
between the floccuh are almost clear A reac 
tion IS regarded as S-h when approxunatel> 
three fourths of the sensitized panicles 
have clumped In a 2+ reacuon half of the 
particles are clumped and half still remain 
m colloidal suspension In a 1+ reaction 
only one fourth of the bentonite panicles 
are clumped In a negauve reacuon the 
sensitized bentonite particles remain in col 
loidal suspension The result of the floccula 
Uon test is considered positive when 2+ or 
stronger clumping occurs in a serum dJu 
tionofl 32 or higher Although a negatively 
reacting serum does not cause an> clumping 
in diluuons up to about 1 1000 occasion 
ally weak flocculation may occur in dilu 
uons of 1 1000 or higher 

With each test performed senal dilutions 
of a known positive and a known negative 
reacting serum should be included in order 
to detect any change in the sensitized ben 
tonite particles If debns has gotten Info 
the sensitized bentonite mixture or the con 
trol negative reacung serum false clumping 
may result With experience the spurious 
aggregates can be disunguished readily 
from true flocculation When the result of 
the test is positive the floccuh are of uni 
form density evenl) distributed in the 
microscopic field and free from "h>3line 
hke" material or other debris 

By this procedure about 85 per cent of 
verified cases of rheumatoid animus give 
positive results The incidence of false posi 
lives IS about 3 per cent

a Centrifuge at 1700 rpm for ten 
minutes and discard supernatant 
b Suspend sediment in saline and re- 
peat step (a) 

c Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for ten 


minutes with buffer solution and

tubes of reagent controls must be included 
6 The lysin control should be completely 
hemolyzed the cell control should show no 
hemolysis and the tiler of the ASTO stand 
ard should correspond to the labeled liter If 
these controls are not correct the test is 
unreliable and the discrepancies must be 
analyzed and corrected The titer expressed 
in Todd umts Is the reciprocal of the high 
est dilution of serum showing no hemolysis 
when viewed by clear strong light For 
example a serum showing no hemolysis in 
tubes 1 through 6 a trace of hemolysis in 
tube 7 and complete hemolysis in the other 
tubes would have an ASO titer of 250 Todd 
umts 

Interpretation 

A single determination is of httle sig 
mficance but a nse in titer or a persistently 
elevated titer in serum over a period of sev 
era! weeks may be of considerable diagnostic 
value The titer that Is considered elevated 
vanes somewhat with the locality and other 
factors but in general a titer of 166 Todd 
units or higher Is definitely elevated A re 
pcated low titer Is good evidence that the 
patient docs not have active rheumatic 
fever On the other hand a high titer docs 
not necessarily mean that the patient is 
suffering from rheumatic fever or acute 
glomerulonephntis but it does indicate that 
a focus of streptococcus infection Is present 
The deciding factors m diagnosis are the 
chmcal symptoms and other relev ant labora 
tory findings 

C RE, VOTIVE l’ROTEI^ 

C reactive protein (CRP ) was first re- 
ported in the blood of patients during the 
acute phase of pneumococcal pneumonia by 
Tillelt and Francis in 1930 It is a protein 
that forms a precipitate with the somatic 
C polysaccharide of the pneumococcus— 
hence the name C reactive protein Later it 
was found in a variety of other condiUons 
and while it is nonspecific for any particular 
disease entity the demonstration of C R P 
In the blood Is a sensitive indicator of In 
ilammallon of infectious or noninfcclious 
origin Changes in the amount of C R P are 
useful for prognostic purposes and for Indi 
eating the efficacy of a tlierapcuiic regimen 
The list shown in Tabic 24-6 Is only a gen 
oral tabulation of the occurrence of CRP 
in disease states which may vary wUn the 
stage of the disease treatment and physical 
state of the patient

Procedure 

1 A capillary tube (0 8 mm in diameter 
X 100 mm in length) is dipped into a vial 
of C reactive protein antiserum • The anti 
serum is allowed to rise about one-third the 
length of the capillary tube A finger is 
placed over the top of the tube before the 
lube is removed from the antiserum and the 
excess is carefully v\ Iped off 

2 With the finger still in place the capil 
lary is then dipped into a tube of the pa 
tienis serum which must be fresh and 
dear and an equal volume drawn up Care 
must be taken to avoid the interposition of 
air bubbles since this will prevent mixing 
Plasma is not satisfactory for this test 

3 The capillary tube is carefully Inv cried 
several times to mix the serums A finger Is 
placed at the end leaving an air space at the 
opposite end Excess serum and finger marks 
are wiped from the lube with cleaning 
tissue and the tube is placed upright in 
plasticine leaving an air space between the 
bottom of the scrum column and the clay 
It Is convenient to employ a wooden block 
with a plasticine filled groove as a pipet 
stand so that a scries of lubes can be set up 
on a single stand 

4 Tlie tulw IS then placed In the Incu 
baior at 37° C for two hours and in the 
refrigerator overnight AUcmailvely the 
lobes may be incubated overnight at room 
temperature 

5 A control scrum known to contain 
CRP should be Included in every series of 
tests as well as a tube with normal rabbit 
scrum in place of antiserum as a control 
for the possible occurrence of nonspicific 
precipitation 

6 The test can also be done as a micro- 
method by the procedure of Coldin and 
Kaplan (1955) Blood Is drawn from the

fingertip, ear lobe, or heel in capillarj tubes 
\vith an outside diameter of about 1 4 ram 
The blood is alloi\ed to clot The clot is 
separated from the \vall of the tube with a 
fine ^"ire, and the capillary tube is cenin 
fuged 

After centnfugation the tube is scratched 
with a small file just abo\e the clot, the 
portion containing the clot is broken off and 
discarded C I\ P antiserum is draivn up 
into one third of a finer capillary tube (out 
side diameter up to 1 1 mm ) A fingertip is 
placed oter the air space of this tube the 
external surfaces of the tube is wiped clean, 
and the antiserum is carefully placed in 
contact with the patients serum in the 
wider capillary tube The patient s serum is 
allowed to flow up tlie remainder of the 
finer tube lea\ing a space of 5 to 10 mm 
The fingertip is placed o\er the top of this 
capillary tube which is then imeried and 
placed air space do^vn into the modeling 
clay rack The test is completed in the usual 
manner 

7 A precipitate will form if the patients 
scrum contains C R P This precipitate may 
appear in as little as 15 minutes but a final 
reading should not be made until overnight 
incubation Readmgs are best made against 
a black background with light falling 
obhquely from above and behind the tubes 
Die amount of precipitate is recorded as 
4+ for maximal precipitation to 0 for no 
precipitation Altematnely the number of 
mOhmeters of precipitate column can be 
measured but it is necessary to take into 
account the vanability of packing of the 
flocculent precipitate if this method of read 
ing is used 

8 A recent modification of this technique 
uses polystyrene latex particles coated v\jtb 
anti C R P serum Die test is done as a 
shde test Other techniques that may be used 
for demonstrating C R P are complement 
fixation and gel diffusion 

Intcrffrelation 

Normal individuals do not have demon 
strable C R P in their scrum The presence 
of this protein indicates an active Inflam 
matory process It is almost inv anably found 
during the active phases of rheumatic fever 
and rheumatoid -irthnUs Die protein is 
also demonstrable in joint fluids and ex 
udates in these conditions It is present 
during certain neoplastic diseases m'o- 
cardial infarction with necrosis disseml 
naled lupus erythematosus and acute 
bacterial and viral infections (Table 24-6) 


The amount of C-R P in the serum is to 
some degree a reflection of the extent and 
seventy of the disease process It can appear 
rapidly after the onset of a pathologic 
process (approximatelv 12 hours) and is 
usually completely eUmmated after the 
stimulus IS removed as in the case of cf 
fective therapy of bacterial infections 
within one or two days Although not re 
lated to this phenomenon the presence of 
C R P is sunflar in its implications to that 
of an elev ated sedimentation rate 

The most extensive clinical application 
of the C R P test is in the evaluation of dis 
ease activity and therapeutic measures in 
acute rheumatic fever Smee the profem 
is present during rheumatic activity sue 
cessfui suppressive therapy causes disap- 
pearance of C R P from the blood Conse 
quently the test can be used to determine 
whether an adequate therapeutic response 
has been obtained 

The C R P test is very sensitive and has 
no equivocal “normal range " smcc it is 
absent from the blood of normal individuals 
It IS important however to realize that the 
test IS completely nonspecific and hence 
must be used in association with clinical 
judgment 


/INTITHIROm ANTIBODirS 

The demonstration of autoantibodies in 
various diseases of the thyroid gland stems 
primarily from the work of ^\ltebsky and 
Rose (1956) and Roittand Domach (J960) 
and their groups Recent work has clearly 
shown that in a high percentage of patients 
with clixonlc (Hishimolos) thvToiditis and 
primary myxedema circulating anlibodJes 
against normal thyToglobulm (stored in col 
loid) or Intracellular (microsomal) anu 
gens can be demonstrated A v aneiy of tech 
niques have been used for this purpose — 
precipilauon in agar gel tanned red cell 
agglutination complement fixation and 
Coons fluorescent antibody technique on 
fixed or unfixed tissue sections In addition 
certain of these sera have been shown to 
give nse to cytotoxic effects when added to 
human thyroid cells in tissue culture 

Diere seems to be little doubt tliat iliesc 
investigations will ultimately find applica 
tions both theoretical and practical in dis 
eases other than those assoclaied with the 
thyroid gland 

The techniques just listed for the demon 
strition of circulating thyToglobulIn anti 
bodies are somewhat complex for use ^s rou 



898 Clinical Diagnosis b \ 

tine procedures A slide test using latex 
particles sensitized wth th>Toglobulin is 
available commercially but is suitable only 
for rough qualitative screening The tech 
nique to be desenbed is a practical one based 
on the bentonite technique for rheumatoid 
arthritis (see p 893) 

Bentomte Particle Test for Detection of 
Thyroid Aulibodies (Ager, Unit, and 
Smith, jy5J») 

Normal thyroid glands removed at au 
topsy arc stnpped of connective tissue and 
blended with twice their weight of physio 
logic NaCl solution in a blender The re 
sultant homogenate is centrifuged at 4000 
r p m to remove heavy cellular debris and 
fibrous tissue This supernatant is then re 
centrifuged at 27 000 r p m for 45 minutes 
at 4'^ C The supernatant is used to sensitize 
the bentonite particles 

A 2 5 gm portion of bentonite is added to 
300 ml of distilled water In a flask and 
thoroughly shaken A 25 ml portion of this 
mixture is added to a heavy wall centrifuge 
tube which is centrifuged at 3000 rpm 
for ten minutes The supernatant is dis 
carded and replaced with 25 ml of distilled 
water the material is mixed vigorously and 
then rccentnfugcd This process is repeated 
twice At the end of the final washing the 
supernatant is removed and thoroughly 
mixed with 2 ml of thyroid antigen After 
standing for one hour at room temperature 
ibc sensitized bentonite pariicles arc washed 
twice in physiologic NaCl solution and 
finally resuspended in 25 ml of saline 
Serial dilutions of the senim to be tested 
arc made in small glass tubes or clear plastic 
agglutination trays Dilutions range from 
1 5 to 1 2 500 000 using 0 25 ml volumes 
and 2 per cent scrum saline as diluent To 
each dilution 0 1 ml of sensitized benlonuc 
particles Is added and the rack or tray is 
placed in the refrigerator overnight Adc 
quatc controls must, of course, be included 
The pattern of deposited benionlie panicles 
is read macroscopically Positive agglutina 
tion is shown by a small central round 
button of agglutinated particles and nega 
lives by a thin carpet of panicles over a 
wide area of the bottom of the tube or cup 
Weak positives sliow a central button with 
a small carpeting around 

Cases of Hashimotos disease give tilers 
as high as 1 25 000 000 Lower tilers (1 5 
to I 250) may be found in other types of 
thyroid disease Normal serums rarely react 
at titers above 1 5 


Laboratorv Methods 

PRECrPlTIN TESTS 

These tests arc utili/ed for many pur- 
poses. such as diagnosis of parasitic dis 
eases typing of various bacteria, and bio- 
logic identification of unknown proteins 
Properly performed, they arc extremely 
sensitive and Jnghly specific Antisera are 
prepared usually in rabbits by immuniza 
tIon With the known protein The anlistrum 
then contains prccipitins which when 
added to a solution of the antigen used for 
immunization (precipitinogen) form a 
visible precipitate Excellent precipitating 
antigens against a vridc variety of sub 
stances are available commercially 

Identificntton of UiiLuonti Antigens 
PnocEDURE (see Table 24-7) 

The unknown substance should be diluted 
about! 100 If a dned clot or blood stain is 
to be tested, it is eluted with sienJc saline 
and the dilution approximated To approx! 
mate a given tJlluiion of serum one can 
make a standard 1 100 dilution of a known 
senim and adjust the unknown in such a 
way that when the known and unknown are 
shaken vigorously side by side the amount 
of foam is similar The solution must be 
clear and should meet the following condi 
Uons 

a It should be almost completely color 
less by transmuted light 
b It should gne only a slight cloudi 
ness when heated with dilute nitric 
acid 

c It should foam freely on shaking 
d The pll should be as dose to neu 
fraJity as possible If either strongly 
acid or alkaline It should he neu 
trallzcd with dilute MCI or NaOII

pipet The unknown solution is carefully 
o\erlaid on the immune serum so as to 
form a sharp line of contact between the two 
fluids 

The dilutions and the \anous controls can 
be taried dependmg on the system being 
studied To conserve reagents the test may 
be conducted m capillary tubes 

A distinct white cloud should appear at 
the line of contact within a few minutes 
deepemng rapidlj to a flocculant precipitate 
the reaction is complete after 20 minutes 

iNTERPRETATIOV 

Provided adequate controls have been 
used the reacuon can be considered specific 
for the antiserum used If blood stains are 
tested the reacuon does not prove the 
presence of blood but onlj of a protem of 
the species indicated Doubt can anse in 
differentiaung among the proteins of verj 
closely related species as for example man 
and monke} or sheep and goats but this 
doubt can practically aivvaj's be removed by 
the use of adequate controls Even old 
stains have given good results wiili this 
technique although stains on leather and 
m earth present difliculues Vanous modi 
fications of this procedure in agar gel 
(Oudm Ouchterlony) are being invesu 
gated and may well prove more practical 
and specific than the method just described 

Groiipmg of Dela flemolyltc ^trelitococci by 
the PrectftiUn Technique 

The grouping and tj'plng of a beta hemo- 
Ijtic streptococcus can readllj be done by 
the same procedure It is necessary to pre 
pare an extract for tesung vviili grouping 
sera Such sera are readily available com 
merciallv Typing of streptococci within the 
groups can only be done in special labora 
tones The determination of the type of a 
group A streptococcus is used pnmanly for 
epidemiologic and mvestigative studies and 
is rarely required in a dinical laboratory 
(see p B2o) However the determination 
of the group to which a streptococcus be 
longs IS an important procedure particularly 
those of Lancefield group A to which the 
vast majontj of human pathogens belong 
Recent work such as that of Moody et al 
(1958) has shown that it is possible to 
group streptococci m smears b> the fluo- 
rescent antibody technique This procedure 
appears to show much promise The use of 
bacitraan discs is recommended for pre 
sumptive identification of group A strep- 


tococci (see p 625) for final identification 
the precipitin method is necessary 

Preparation of Extract It is necessarj to 
bung about partial dismtegration of the cell 
wall with the release of soluble carbohjdrate 
( C substance") in a form that retains its 
serologic reactivity Several different meth 
ods are employed for tins purpose of which 
those of Lancefield the autoclave method of 
Rantz and Randall (1945) and the en 
zyme procedure of Maxted (1948) will be 
described briefly The latter is simpler and 
more rapid than the other procedures More 
complete descriptions will be foimd m the 
references 

Lancefield Procedure The orgamsms are 
grown for 18 to 24 hours in Todd Hewitt 
broth The culture is centrifuged and the 
supernatant discarded after which the sedi 
mem IS suspended m 5 to 7 drops of N 5 
HCl This is placed in a boiling water bath 
for ten minutes and cooled for another ten 
minutes It is then centrifuged again The 
sediment is discarded and one drop of 0 01 
per cent phenol red is added to the clear 
supernatant fluid Buffer (Igm sodium acid 
phosphate in 100 ml N/5 NaOH) is added 
drop by drop until a pale pink color de 
velops Following another centrifugation the 
clear supernatant fluid is used as the anti 
gen for the preapitm test (Swaft et al 
1943) 

lutoclavc Procedure (Rintz and Ran 
dall) The streptococa to be grouped are 
grown overnight m 50 ml of trypticase soy 
or try^itose phosphate broth The cultures 
are centrifuged and the sediment suspended 
in a small amount of sterile saline The 
tube iS then autoclaved at 35 lb pressure 
for J5 minutes and the tube again centn 
fug^ The clear supernatant is used for the 
antigen 

E^ttic Procedure (Maxted 1948) A loop- 
ful of growth of the streptococci to be 
grouped is placed in 0 25 ml of the enzyme 
The enzyme consists of a powerful proteo- 
lytic substance isolated from Streptomyces 
albus (Details for the preparation of this 
material can be found in the references ) 
The tubes are placed in a water bath at 50° 

C for 90 minutes The clear solution con 
tarns the soluble antigen that is used in the 
test 

RING PRECIP1TI^ TECHNIQUE TOR 
STREPTOCOCCUS GROUPING 

1 A capillary tube (I 0 to 15 mm m 
diameter) is dipped mto the streptococcus 



900 Climcai Diagnosis by 

grouping antiserum and a column of 25 to 
30 mm IS allowed to nse mto the tube 

2 The excess serum is ^viped from out 
side of the capillary tube which is then 
dipped into the previously prepared strep- 
tococcal extract A column equal to the anti 
serum is allowed to enter mto the capillary 
tube Care must be used to insure contact 
between the serum and antigen 

3 The tube contammg the antiserum 
extract mixture is wiped placed into a 
plasQcme block and incubated at room 
temperatme Macroscopic precipitate ap- 
pears withm a few minutes and is complete 
m 30 minutes 

A control consisting of an extract of strep- 
tococci of a knowm group should be in 
eluded The procedure can be repeated with 
different dilutions of the antigen If no 
reacuon occurs one maj be dealing with 
streptococci of a different group or a pro- 
zone reaction may be occurring To deter 
mine this the extract should be diluted and 
retested with the antiserum

The Sputum 


By UUNJAMIN B WLLLS M D 


Several circumstances in recent years have 
greatly diminished the attention paid to 
detailed examination of the sputum Chief 
among these are the development of more 
accurate roentgen diagnosis and the use of 
antibiotic agents In acute bacterial infec 
tion of the lungs antibiotic therapy often so 
alters the chancter of the sputum that clas 
SIC findings cannot be made even when the 
disease process is not entirely checked 
Therefore some of the observations eon 
tamed in this chapter arc seldom used in 
preseni-da) practice However in addition 
to occasional practical requirements these 
observauons have sufTicient instructional 
value to warrant thtir inclusion In a work 
of this nature Many of the macroscopic and 
microscopic studies of sputum hive been 
displaced by more sophisticated methods of 
microbiology and pulmonary physiology It 
IS to be hoped that students and teachers 
will appreciate the retention of certain 
descriptions that have more historic inter 
est than current utility 

Before beginning the study of the sputum 
the student will do well to famxUanze him 
self with the structures that normally may 
be present in the mouth and that frequently 
appear in the sputum Nasal mucus and 
material obtamed by scraping the tongue 
and about the teeth should be studied by 
(he method used for the examination of 
unstained sputum A drop of compound 
solution of iodine (Lugols solution) should 
be placed at the edge of the coverglass and 
as it runs under its effect on different struc 
tures should be noted A portion of the 
sputum should be spread on slides or cover 
glasses and stained by some simple stain 
and bj Gram s method The structures likely 


to be encountered are epithelial cells of 
columnar and squamous types leukocytes 
chiefly mononuclear leukocytes the so 
called salivary corpuscles food particles 
Leploinchtn biiccahs great numbers of 
saprophytic bictern and frequently spiro 
chetes and Entamoeba These structures will 
be desenbed later 

When collecting the sample for examini 
tion the morning sputum or all the sputum 
that IS cvpectoratcd in 24 hours should be 
saved In cases of incipient tuberculosis 
Afycobocfentmi tnbercidosis often can be 
found in the material that is coughed up 
m the morning but cannot be detected m 
material that is coughed up at my other 
time of the day Sometimes m cases of early 
tuberculosis there are only a few mucopuru 
lent flakes that contain the Mycol acteriuii 
tuberculosis or the organism may be found 
only in a small purulent mass that is 
coughed up every few days These masses 
may easily be overlooked by the patient 

Patients should be instructed to nnse 
their mouths well in order to avoid con 
tamination with food particles which may 
prove confusing m the exammation and to 
make sure that the sputum contains ma 
tenal from the lungs or bronchi Many 
persons find it difficult to disunguish be 
tween material that comes from the lungs 
or bronchi and matenal that comes from 
the nose or nasopharynx It is desirable that 
the material be raised with a distinct expul 
sivc cough but this is not always possible 
Matenal from the upper air passages can 
usually be identified by the large proporuon 
of mucus and the character of the epithelial 
cells In some cases of chronic tuberculosis 
there may be no cough at all the small 


903 



904 Climcal Diagnosis Laborator’\ Methods 


masses may be raised b> the action of the 
bronchial and tracheal cilia, and the patient 
may become conscious of the masses only 
when thej reach the larynx Patients often 
swallow the masses ivithout realizmg their 
significance Aspiration of the stomal con 
tents m such cases may yield material in 
which acid fast organisms may be found 

The collection of sputum from asympto 
matic patients or from those wth 
unproductive cough can be aided by the 
inhalation of nebulized fluids which are 
subsequently expelled as sputum A heated 
salme aerosol has proved quite satisfactory 
for the artificial production of sputum used 
for cytologic study in the detection of lung 
cancer (Bickerman et al 1958 Uimker 
et al , 1960) and for bactenologic diagnosis 
of tuberculosis 

The sputum of infants and young chil 
dren is usually swallowed and cannot be 
collected In such cases examination of the 
feces for Mycobactenum tuberculosis will 
sometimes estabhsh a diagnosis of tuber 
culosis 

As a receptacle for the sputum a clean, 
wide mouth bottle with a tightly fittmg cork 
or screw cap may be used The pauent must 
be particularly cauuoned against smearing 
any of the sputum on the outside of the 
bottle This is probably the chief source of 
danger to persons who examine sputum 
Disi^ectants should not be added Although 
some of them (phenol, for example) do not 
mterfere with detection of the Mifcobac 
tenum tuberculosis, they generally alter the 
character of the sputum and render it unfit 
for further exammation 

The foUomng plan is suggested for the 
routme exammation of sputum 

1 Spread the matenal in a thin layer in 
a large Petn dish 

2 Examine all parts carefully with the 
naked eye or with a hand lens This is best 
done ov er a dark background The portions 
most suitable for further exammation may 
thus be easily selected 

3 Transfer vanous porUons includmg 
all suspicious particles to clean slides, 
cover and examine unstamed with the 
microscope A wooden apphcator may be 
used to transfer selected poruons of sputum 
to the glass sbde The apphcator is then 
used as a spreader and can be burned in 
the Bunsen flame 

4 Slip the coverglasses from some or all 
the unstained preparaUons leaving a thin 
smear on both slide and coverglass 

5 and fix the smears and stain one 
or more by a staining method for Myco- 


bactenum tuberculosis or by Gram s method 

6 When indicated, make special exam 
inations for capsules of bacteria and for 
eosmophihc cells 

After the exammation has been com 
pleted the sputum must be destroyed by 
heat or chemicals and everything that has 
come m contact with it must be sterilized 
The utmost care must be taken not to allow 
any of it to dry and become disseminated 
through the air The sputum must be kept 
covered It is a good plan to conduct the 
exammation on a large newspaper, which 
can then be burned Contammation of the 
work table is thus avoided If this is not 
feasible, the table should be washed off with 
a 1 10 dilution of compound solution of 
cresol or with some other disinfectant and 
allowed to dry slowly as soon as the ex 
ammation of the sputum has been com 
pleted 

AIACROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 

Quantit) The quantity of sputum ex 
peciorated in 24 hours vanes greatly It may 
be so slight as to be overlooked entirely in 
cases of incipient tuberculosis It is usually 
small in cases of acute bronchitis or lobar 
pneumonia It may be very large— some- 
times as much as 1000 ml— In advanced 
tuberculosis with I'irge cavities in edema 
of the lung and bronchiectasis, after rupture 
of an abscess or m empyema It is desirable 
to obtain a general idea of the quantity, but 
accurate measurement is unnecessary 

Color Smce the sputum ordmarily con 
sists of varymg proportions of mucus and 
pus it may be colorless and translucent or 
Opaque, whitish or yellow, and purulent 
Yellowish green sputum is frequently seen 
m cases of advanced tuberculosis and 
chrome bronchitis In jaundice in caseous 
pneumoma and m slowly resolving lobar 
pneumonia it may assume a bright green 
color owing to bile or altered blood pigment 

A red or reddish brown color usually 
indicates the presence of blood or blood 
pigment Bnght red blood v%hich most 
commonly occurs In streaks is strongly 
suggestive of tuberculosis It may be noted 
early in the disease and generally denotes 
an extension of the tuberculous process 
One must, however, be certain that the 
blood streaked mucus or mucopus is not due 
to nasopharyngeal infection or imtation 
Bloodstained sputum is also sometimes 
seen in bronchiectasis A rusty red sputum 
is the rule m lobar pneumonia and was at 
one time considered pathognomonic of the

disease Exactly similar material may be 
raised in cases of pulmonary infarction 
Bro^^'n sputum owing to altered blood pig 
ment follo\vs hemorrhage from the lungs 
and is present in chronic passive congestion 
of the lungs, which is most frequently due 
to cardiac decompensation 

Consistency. Sputum usually is classified 
as serous, mucoid, purulent, seropurulcnt, 
or mucopurulent These terms are self-bx 
planatory As a rule the more mucus and 
the less pus and serum a sputum contains, 
the more tenacious it is 
The rusty sputum of lobar pneumonia is 
extremely tenacious, so that the vessel in 
which it is contained may be inverted with 
out spilling the sputum The same is true 
of the almost purel) mucoid sputum (spu- 
tum crudum) of be^nnlng acute bronchitis 
and of that which follows an attack of 
asthma A purely serous sputum, usually 
slightly blood tinged, is fairly characteristic 
of edema of the lungs 
Formerly much attention w as paid to the 
so-called nummular sputum This consists 
of definite mucopurulent masses, which 
flatten into coinlike disks and sink m water 
It is fairlj charactcrisuc of tuberculous and 
broncliicctatJc cavities 
Lajcr rormation Some specimens of 
sputum show a striking tendency to separate 
into three sharply defined layers when a 
large volume is allowed to stand in a toll 
\e8sel This is notably (rue in broncbiec 
tasis, gangrene, and abscess of the lung 
Dittrich’s Plugs Although these bodies 
sometimes appear in the sputum, they are 
more frequently expectorated alone They 
are jellowish or gray caseous masses, they 
usually are about the size of the head 
of a pm but someumes may become as 
large as a navy bean ^Vhen crushed, they 
emit a foul odor Microscopically they con- 
sist of granular debns, fat globules, fatty 
acid crystals, and bacteria They are formed 
in the bronchi The) are sometimes expec- 
torated by healthy persons but are observ’ed 
more frequently in cases of putrid bron- 
chitis and bronchiectasis Patients com- 
monly regard them as evidence of tubercu- 
losis The similar caseous masses that are 
formed in the crypts of the tonsils are some- 
times also included under this name 
Lung Stones At times during the course 
of chrome tuberculosis sm^ calcified 
nodules of tuberculous tissue may be ex 
pectorated These consUtute the majority 
of the so-called pneumohths Small foreign 
bodies, bits of clothing — and similar ma 
tenal, which are earned into the lung by 


gunshot and other Injuries, may sometimes 
remam for years and finally ulcerate into 
a bronchus and be expectorated, usually 
with hemorrhage 

Bronclual Casts These are branching 
trechke casts of the bronchi They fre 
qucntly, but not always are composed of 
fibnn (Figs 25-1 and 25-2) They are usu 
ally white or grayish in color but may be 
reddish or broum owing to the presence of 
blood pigment Their size vanes with that of 
the bronchi in which they are formed 
Casts 15 cm or more m length have been 
observed, but most bronchial casts are very 
much smaller Ordinarily they are roUed 
into a ball or tangled mass and can be 
recogmzed only by floating them out in 
water They are best seen over a black back 
ground \Vhen examined m this manner 
their treehke structure becomes evident 
Gross examination usually will suffice but 



Fujure 25-2 Bronchial casts (natural size) as

found

a hand lens occasional!) ma) be required 

Bronchial casts appear in the sputum in 
lobar pneumonia in fibnnous bronchitis 
and in cases of diphtheria in which the 
lesion extends into the bronchi In diph 
thena they are usually large In £bnnous 
or chrome plastic bronchitis they are of 
medium size and usuall) of charactensuc 
structure Their demonstration Is essential 
for the diagnosis of this disease In some 
cases the) may be found e\ery da\ for 
considerable periods in others only occa 
sionally In almost eiery case of lobar 
pneumonia the casts are present in the 
sputum in \anable numbers during the 
stages of resolution In this disease the) 
are usually small (0 5 to 1 cm long) and 
often are not branched 

MICROSCOPIC EXVMIN VTION 

The portions of the sputum most bkely 
to contain structures of interest should be 
\ er) carefully selected as already described 
The few minutes spent in this preliminary 
examination tvill sometimes sate hours of 
work later Opaque white or yellow parti 
clcs are most frequentl) bits of food but 
may be dices) masses from the tonsUs Such 
particles sometimes caseous may be dc> 
nted from tuberculous cavities and contain 
man) tubercle bacilb and elastic fibers 
Curschmanns spirals small fibnnous casts 
coiled into little balls or shreds of mucus 
wath great numbers of entangled pus cor 
puscles may also be seen The food particles 
most likely to cause confusion are bits of 
bread tvhich can be recognized by the blue 
color the) assume when touched with a 
solution of iodine Some structures are best 
idenufied without staimng others require 
that the sputum be stained 

Unstained 5/ utum 

A careful stud) of the unstained sputum 
should be included In escry routine exam 
ination Unfortunatth it is almost uni 
sersall) neglected This examination best 
reveals certain structures that are seen 
imperfectly or not at all in siaincd prepara 
lions It Rives a general Idea of the other 
structures that arc present such as pus 
cells eosinophils epithelial cells and 
blood and thus suggests appropnate stains 
to be used later It enables one to select 
more intelligcntl) the portions to be exam 
ined for Mtjcohactennm tui eradosis 

The panicle selected for examinatitm 
should be transfetred to a clean slide cov 


Laporator) Methods 

ercd with a clem coverglass and examined 
first with the 16 mm ob;ectne and then 
with the 4 mm objective The oil immersion 
objecuve should not be used for this pur 
pose It IS convenient to handle the bus of 
sputum with a wooden toothpick or with a 
wooden applicator that has been wrapped 
wath cotton which ma) be burned when the 
exammation has been completed The plat 
Jnum wire used in bacteriologic work is un 
satisfactory because it usually is not stiff 
enough A little practice is ncccssar) before 
one can handle particles of sputum rcadiJ) 
The bit desired should be separated from 
the bulk of the sputum by cutting it free 
with a toothpick and drawing it out on the 
dry portion of the glass dish It can then 
be picked up by rotating the end of a fresh 
toothpick against it The slide should never 
be dipped into the sputum and none of the 
sputum should be allowed to run over the 
edges of the slide 

Tlic more Important structures to be seen 
in unstained sputum arc elastic fi^rs

should be taken. The selected bit is taken 
on a sUde, and a co^'erglass is applied and 
pressed down so as to give a moderately 
thin preparation, which should be examined 
before it dries. Careful selection of the por- 
tion e.xamined is more efficient than is the 
concentration method — boiling ^viih a 10 
per cent solution of caustic soda and cen- 
trifuging — which is widely recommended. 

- The search should be conducted with the 
16 mm. objective, altliough a higher power 


objective is often needed to identify the 
fib^ wiUt certainty. They are slender, 
hif^ly refractive, wavy fibrils with double 
contour and curled, often split, ends. Very 
characteristic are their graceful curves with- 
out sharp bends, their uniform diameter, 
and their smoothness, although in old spu- 
tum they may be much roughened. The 
fibers may lie singly or in bundles. Fre- 
quently they are found in alveolar arange- 
ment, and the original outline of the alveoli 
of the lungs is preserved (Figs. 25-3 and 
25-4), This arangement is positi^'e proof 
of their origin in the lung. 

- LeptotricJiia buccalis, which is a norma! 
inhabitant of the mouth, may easily be 
mistaken for clastic tissue with the lower 
power objective. It usually can be distin-

guished easily when studied with the 4 mm 
objective 

Fatty acid crystals, which are often pres- 
ent in Dittnch’s plugs and in sputum that 
has remained in the body for some time, 
also simulate elastic tissue when very long, 
but they are more hke stiff, straight, or 
curved needles than ivavy threads T^ey 
show varicosities when the coverglass is 
pressed doivn on them, and they melt info 
droplets when the shde is heated 

The structures that most frequently con 
fuse the student are cotton fibrils, which are 
often present as a eontsminsvon from the 
air These are usually coarser than elastic 
fibers and are fiat with one or two tinsts 
and often have longitudinal stnations and 
frayed ends Their color too is soinewbat 
different Cotton fibers lack the faint yel 
lowish tinge of elastic tissue Very impor- 
tant also IS the relative degree of refractility 
If the diaphragm is opened sloivly, elastic 
fibers can be seen long after the stighdy 
refractile strands of mucus have disap- 
peared, but fiinally they also are pracucally 
lost in the glare, while cotton fibers stiU 
remain visible In examining stained prepa 
rations, students frequently report fibrils 
of precipitated mucus as elastic (issue 
Elastic fibers of food are coarser, genemlly 
shorter, less frequently wavy, and not ar- 
ranged m an alveolar order 

Cursciimann’s Spirals These peculiar 
structures are found most frequently m 
bronchial asthma and are fairly charac- 
teristic of this disease Although they are 
not present In every attack, they probably 
occur at some time in every case Sometimes 
the> can be found onij near the end of the 
attack They occasionally may be present m 
cases of chronic bronchitis and other dis 
eases, but in these cases there is nearly al 
ways an underlying asthmatic tendency 
Their nature has not been definitely deter- 
mined 

Macroscopically they are whiUsh or yel 
loiv wavy threads frequently coiled into 
httle balls (Fig 25-5) Their length Is 
rarely more than 1 5 cm , though it some- 
times exceeds 5 cm They can sometimes be 
defimtely recogmzed with the naked eye 
Under a 16 mm objective they appear as 
mucous threads with a bnght, colorless, 
central hne — the so-called central fiber — 
about which arc wound many fine fibrils 
(Figs 25-6 and 25-7) The bnght central 
line IS best seen when the objective Is raised 
a little above the true focus This line has 
been interpreted as an optical phenomenon 
ovvang to tight coilmg of the spiral In some

withm them, and sometimes Charcot Leyden 
crystals also are present Not infrequent!) 
the spirals are imperfectly formed and con 
sist merely of twisted strands of mucus en 
dosing leukocytes The central fiber is 
absent in these spirals 

Charcot-Lc)dcn Crystals Of the crystals 
that may be found in the sputum, the most 
interesting arc the Charcot Leyden crystals 
They may be absent when the sputum is-* 
expectorated but appear in large numbers 
after it has stood for some time They arc 
rarely found except in cases of bronchial 
asthma At one time they were thought to 
be the cause of this disease They frequentl) 
adhere to Curschmann’s spirals Their exact 
nature is unknown Their formation seems 
to be connected in some way with the pres 
ence of eosinophilic cells They also are 
found in the feces m assodation with 
parasites

greater than is usually used in studying these struc- 
tures. 

Tlieir size varies greatly; their average 
length Is about three or four times the 
diameter of an erythrocyte. 

Other crystals— -hematoldin, cholesterol, 
and, most frequendy, fatty acid needies — 
are common in sputum that has remained 
in the body for a considerable lime, as in 
cases of abscess of the lung and bronchiec- 
tasis. Fatty acid crystals arc regularly found 
in Dittrich’s plugs. They might be mistaken 
,»for elastic fibers. Sometimes they form 
rounded masses ^vilh the indhidual crystals 
radially arranged, and they then bear con- 
siderable resemblance to the clumps of 
Actinomyces isracli. 

Pigmented Ceils. Granules of pi^ent are 
sometimes seen in ordinary pus cells, 
but the more common and more important 
pigment-containing cells are large mono- 
nuclear cells. The origin of these cells is 
doubtful. They were formerly thought to be 
the flattened epithelial cells that line the 
pulmonary alveoli. The present tendency is 
to identify them with the endothelial leu- 
kocytes, which are knosvn to take up pig- 
ment granules readily. In view of recent 


studies the question of their origin must be 
left open, Two kinds of pigmented cells 
deseive mention: those which contain blood 
pigment, chiefly hemosiderin, and those 
which contain carbon. As a rule these cells 
also have a coarsely granular appearance 
owing to the presence of many small color- 
less myelin globules. 

To the Cells containing blood pigment the 
name “heart-failure cells” has been given, 
because they are most frequently found 
when long-continued passive congestion of 
the lungs has resulted from poorly compen- 
sated heart disease. The presence of these 
Cells in considerable numbers, by diirecting 
one’s attention to the heart, will sometimes 
clear up the cause of chronic bronchitis. 
'They are sometimes so numerous as to give 
the sputum a brownish tinge. Such cells arc 
also found in the sputum in cases of pul- 
monary Infarction and for some time after 
a pulmonary hemorrhage. In fresh un- 
stained sputum heart-failure cells appear as 
round, grayish, or colorless bodies filled with 
various size rounded granules of yellow to 
brmvn pigment (Fig. 25-9 [upper]). Some- 
times the pigment appears as a diffuse stain- 
ing. 'The nucleus is usually obscured by the 
pigment. The cells are large; they average 
about 35 microns in diameter. 

To demonstrate the nature of the brown 
pigment, apply a 10 per cent solution of 
potassium ferrocyanide for a few minutes 
and then apply iveak hydrochloric acid. 
Iron-containing pigment assumes a blue 
cedor. Many of the granules will, however, 
fall to respond. The test may be applied 
either to wet preparations or to dried 
smears. 

Carbon-laden cells (Fig. 25-9 [upper]) 
are less important. They are especially 
abundant in the sputum in cases of anthra- 
cosis in which angular black granules, both 
intracellular and extracellular, may be so

healthy persons, and they may be found in

These include various ij'pes of leukocytes

Leukocytes Polymorphonuclear neutro-

specimen of sputum At times the sputum 
may consist of httle else Thc> appear as 
granular rounded cells 30 to 12 microns in 
diameter with several nuclei or one very 
irregular nucleus which when unstained is 
obscured by the granules In preparations 
stained by any of the usual methods the 
nuclei stand out clearly and their poly 
morphous character makes identification of 
these cells easy (Fig 25-9 feenterj) In old 
sputum the polymorphonuclear neutrophils 
may be much disintegrated and hence dilR 
cult to recognize even when stained When 
these cells predominate m the sputum 
the presence of a pyogenic infection may be 
assumed 

Lymphocytes are generally present in 
small numbers with the ordinary pus 
cells from which they are distinguished 
by the presence of a single round nucleus 
In cases of early or mild pure tuberculous 
infection they arc usually the predominat 
ing type of cell and they may be of much 
help in dfstmguisfiing fhes disease front

THE SPUTUM IN DISCVSE 

Strictly speaking any apprccialle amount 
of sputum is abnormal A great many 
healthy persons however raise a smaU 
quantity each morning owing chiefly to im 
tation by inhaled dust and smoke Altliougli 
not normal this can hardly be spoken of as 
pathologic Ordlnanly the material reaches 
the larynx without coughing Tins condition 
is particularly frequent among cjty divcHcrs 
and among those who smoke cigarettes to 
excess In the latter the amount of sputum 
is sometimes so great as to arouse suspicion 
of tuberculosis Such “norrnal morning spu 
turn" or "sputum of irritation" generally con 
sists of small ratlier dense mucoid masses 
wlilch are translucent white or when due to 
inhaled smoke gray In color Microscop 
ically there arc a few pus cells but usually 
many endothelial leukocytes The pus cells 
and the endothelial leukocytes may contain 
carbon particles The endothelial leukocytes 
commonly show myelm degeneration and 
free myelin globules may be present in 
large numbers Saprophytic bacteria may 
be present but arc not abundant 

Acute Rtonchiiis In the early stage of 
acute bronchitis there is a small amount of 
tenacious almost purely mucoid sputum 
which frequently is blood streaked Tins 
gradually becomes more abundant muco- 
purulent m character and yellowish or gray 
in color At first the leukocytes commonly 
show myelin degeneration and free myelm 
globules may be present in large numbers 
Saprophytic bacteria may be abundant 

Chrome Bronchitis In tills disease the 
sputum is usually abundant mucopurulent 
and yellowish or yellowish green in color 
Nummular masses like those that occur in 
tuberculosis are sometimes seen Micro- 
scopically there are great numbers of pus 
cells often much dismtegrated Epithelium 
is not abundant Bacteria of various kinds 
especially staphylococci are usually nu 
merous 

In fibrinous bronchitis tlicre are found m 


In chrome bronchitis that accompames 
long-continued passive congestion of the

actcnstic sputum is greenish or grayish 
purulent and very abundant — sometimes 
as much as a liter in 24 hours— and has an 
offensive odor It is thinner than that of 
chronic bronchitis and on standing sep 
arates into three layers of pus serum and 
frothy mucus It contains great numbers 
of miscellaneous bacteria Small hem 
orrliages are common A feature of cases 
with a single large cavity is the periodic

is not uell enough recognized by prac 
titioners A careful inspecuon of all the spu 
turn brought up by the patient on se\eral 
successive days and microscopic examina

estabhsh a diagnosis of tuberculosis when 
physical signs are negative Intelhgent co- 
operation of the patient is essential in such 
cases Mycobacterium tuherculosts some- 
times wall be found in large numbers at this 
stage Blood streaked sputum is strongly 
suggestiv e of tuberculosis and is more com 
mon m the early stages than later It usually 
indicates an advancing process 

In cases in which the disease is advanced 
the sputum resembles that of chronic 
bronchitis with the addition of Mycobac 
tenum tuberculosis and elasuc fibers Num 
mular masses — circular comhke disks 


which sink in water — may be seen Caseous 
particles contaimng immense numbers of 
the bacilU are common In cases in which 
the disease is far advanced and cavities 
have been present for a long time there may 
be firm spheric or ovoid gravish masses in 
thin fluid — the sociUed globular sputum 
The» globular masses usually contain many 
tubercle bacilli Severe hemorrhages are fre 
quent and for some tunc after tlie hem 
orrhages occur the sputum may contain

Exudates, Transudates, and 
Cerebrospinal Fluid 


By BENJAMIN B WELLS, M D. 


PERITONEAL, PLEURAL AND 
PERICARDIAL FLUIDS 

The serous cavities normally contain very 
little fluid, but considerable quanuties are 
frequently present as a result of pathologic 
conditions The pathologic fluids are classed 
as transudates and exudates 
Transudates are noninflammatory in on* 
gin Their color is light yellow or greenish 
yellow, and they may be clear, slightly 
cloudy, or opalescent They contain only a 
few cells and less than 2 5 per cent of 
albumin, and do not coagulate spontane- 
ously The specific gravity is below I 018 
Microorgamsms are seldom present 
Exudates are of inflammatory origin 
They are ncher in cells and albumin and 
tend to coagulate on standing The specific 
gravity is above 1 018 The amount of al 
bumin may be estimated by Kingsbury’s 
or Esbach’s method, after diluting the fluid 
if much albumin is present A mucin like 
substance, called serosamucin, is likewise 
found in exudates It is detected by acidify- 
ing with a few drops of 5 per cent acetic 
acid, which produces a white cloudy pre- 
cipitate This reaction is helpful in dis- 
tinguishing transudates from exudates al- 
though some transudates become shghtly 
turbid when acetic acid is added Bactena 
are generally present and often are numer- 
ous When none are found in stained smears 
or cultures, tuberculosis should be subjected 
and animal inoculation should be used 
Exudates are usually classed as serous. 


serofibrinous, seropurulent, purulent, and 
hemorrhagic In addition, chylous and 
chyloid exudates occasionally occur In tlie 
chylous form the milkiness is due mainly 
to the presence of minute fat dTop]ets and 
may be the result of rupture of a lymph 
vessel, usually from obstruction of the 
thoracic duct Chyloid exudates arc milky 
otnng chiefly to proteins m suspension or 
to fine debns from broken down cells These 
exudates are most frequcntlj seen in car- 
cinoma and tuberculosis of the peritoneum 
It may be that all milky effusions are In 
reality chylous, although m some (chyloids, 
pseudochylous) the fat is so finely divided 
as to take on some of the properties of col 
loids 

Brescia (1941) gave the folloiving char 
actenstics for chylous fluid obtained from 
the pleural cavity in cases of chylothorax 
(1) The fluid has a milky appearance (2)

by trauma to the thoracic duct is excluded 
the commonest cause of an accumulation 
of chjlous fluid IS some neoplastic disease 


Cytoihngitosis 

Cytodiagnosis is based on a differential 
count of the cells m a transudate or exu 
date particularly one of pleural or pen 
toneal ongin 

A tube of the fresh fluid obtained by 
aspiration and preferably mixed at once 
with a httle citrated salt solution toprexent 
clotting IS centnfuged for at least five 
minutes The supernatant liquid is poured 
off and smears are made from the sediment 
and dned m the air The fluid must be 
very fresh and the smears must be thin and 
quickly dned othenvise the cells wall be 
small shrunken and difficult to identify 
The smears are then stained with Wnghis 
blood stain which has preferably been di 
luted previously with a third its volume of 
pure methyl alcohol The smears are exam

Predominance of polymorphonuclear leu 
kocytes (pus cells) points to an acute 
infecuous process (Fig 26-1) These cells 
are the neutrophils of the blood Eosmophils 
and mast cells are rare In thin smears they 
are easily recogmzed the cytoplasmic gran 
ules often staining characteristically with 
polychrome methylene blue and eosm Li 
thick smears on the other hand they are 
often small and shrunken they are difficult 
to identify and are easily mistaken for 
lymphocytes 

A large number or even a preponderance 
of eosmophils is seen m about 1 to 5 per 
cent of cases of pleural effusion The sig 
luficance is uncertam Some of these effu 
sions have followed artifiaal pneumothorax 
others have been of tuberculous ongm 

Predominance of lymphocytes (Fig 26- 
2) generally signifies tuberculosis They arc 
the same as found m the blood The cyto- 
plasm is usually scaniv is often ragged 
and sometimes is apparently absent entirely

Cytodiagnostic Method for Effusions 

AND Exudates (Papanicolaou 1954) 

Cell Block An exudate is generally clot 
ted by the time it reaches the laboratory 
To obtain a specimen for a block it is neces 
sary to stick a large wooden appbeator into 
the mass and to twist and stir while press 
mg against the sides of the container The 
excess fluid wU be pressed out and a flbnn 
mass will collect on the applicator The mass 
IS WTapped in tissue paper and placed in 
a tissue capsule flxed m 10 per cent forma 
Im and processed as a tissue 

It is important when embeddmg the block 
to spread the material well over the bottom 
of the embedding mold for this gives good 
distribution of cells Cut the block at 5 
microns bemg sure to get a representative 
section of the block on the slide 

Stain with hematoxylm and eosin Stain 
ing according to the Papanicolaou method 
gives a good contrast Jf a block of a trans 
udate IS desired and no flbnn masses are 
noted mix 100 ml of the fluid with 100 ml 
of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and ceninfuge 
at moderate speed for 15 minutes Place the 
soft mass that is formed by precipitaaon 
into some tissue paper and place in a tissue 
capsule Process as just desenbed 

Direct Smear Imviediately after with 
drawal centrifuge three times for five 
minutes at moderate speed each time re 
moving the supernatant fluid and adding 
more fluid to Uie sediment already in the 
tube After the third centrifuging decant the 
supernatant fluid and make smears in the 
following manner 

Place a small drop of Mayer s albumin in 
the center of a sbdc and add a large drop 
of the sediment to it Place another slide on 
top of this and allow the fluids to spread 
out over the slide Pull the slides apart 
Allow only the edges to drv before placing 
the slides into a fixative of equal parts of

95 per cent ethyl alcohol and petroleum 
ether The sbdes are allowed to fix for 30 
to €0 minutes (The latter is preferred 
because it assures adherence of the ma 
tenal to the slides during staining and 
washing ) The smears are stained according 
to the Papanicolaou technique The hema

EXFOLIATIVE CITTOLOGY 

The patient should not have had any 
intraiagmal examinations, douches, or ther- 
apy of any kind 24 hours pnof to the 
cytological examination The paaenl is 
placed upon an examining table in the 
lithotomy position A speculum is intro- 
duced into the vagina and the portio vagi 
nalis IS visualized Lubricant should not he 
introduced into the vagina nor should a net 
sj^culum be used AE powder should be 
wiped off glov es before spatulas are 
handled, since the presence of starch 
pantiles nii! make the interpretation of 
the slides difBcuIc 

Vaginal Smear. Scrap very sbghtlv with 
a tongue depressor the upper lateral wall 
of the V agina and make a thm smear with- 
out pressure From this smear the hormonal 
reading and microbiologic reading will be 
made 

Cervical Smear. Scrape slightly with a 
spatula (or a tongue depressor) the entire 
portio V aginahs uten especially the borders 
of an erosion and smear on the slide 

Endocervical Smear. Introduce a cotton 
swab applicator into the cervical canal, 
rotate sh^tly, and make the smear 

Special Cases (Suspicion of Endometrial 
Cancer) A fourth smear (endometrial as

three smears just mentioned usuall> do no 
contain adequate matenal from the utenm 
cavity 

HonnotwJ Heading 

For exact hormonal reading the smem 
must be taken gently from the lateral vag 
inal wall, since here the cells are fresh 
and are representative of those being ex- 
foliated that day An exact evaluation of the 
menstrual cyclic changes can be made only 
from smears prepared every day throughout 
one cycle For an informative reading in 
stenJity cases smears should be made 14 
and 3 days pnot to the next expected 
menstruation 

rtKdtion 

As soon as each smear is spread, jt should 
be fixed immediately while wet without any 
time lapse for air drying fn the office this 
can be accomplished by adding 5 drops of 
Cyto-Dn Fix (a commercially available fixa 
tive) to the wet smear In the hospital and 
dimes or whenever preferable smears may 
be immersed immediately while wet into 
a liquid fixative consisting of equal parts 
of ether and 95 per cent ethyl alcohol 

COLLECTION OF MATERIALS FOR

GASTRIC LAVAGE FOR C\TOLOGIC 
EXA-MINATION 

PTfparaltoti of the Patient 

For a successful cytologic examination of 
stomach contents it is important that the 
patients stomach be prepared properly “Hie 
patient is instructed to cat a light supper 
the night before and no breakfast on the 
day of the test The patient is encouraged 
to dnnk plenty of ^vater to clean the stomach 
of any debris or retained food If retention 
IS encountered unexpectedly, the stomach 
should be cleansed with large volumes of 
saline solution and the cytologic examina 
tion performed the following day The 
reason for the delay is that the exfoliated 
cells are washed away and time must be 
allowed for the shedding of more cells 
Avoid domg cytologic examinations under 
any but the very best conditions 

Inttibalioii 

The patient sits upright If dentures are 
present they are removed An iced rubber 
Levin tube (No 18) or a warmed plastic 
tube is inserted through the mouth With 
careful attention to midline placement of 
the tube and an assisting swallow by the 
patient the Levin tube is passed rapidly 
55 cm into the body of the stomach The 
stomach is aspirated with a 100 ml syringe 
It is important to obtain at least a few 
miUihters of residue for this mdicates that 
the tip of the tube has reached the most 
dependent portion of the stomach If no

fluid IS obtained the tube should be with 
drawn to the cardioesophageal junction (40 
cm ) and reinserted slowly 

Lm age 

Since the amount of exfoUated material 
obtained is directly proportional to the 
degree of energy expended the lavage must 
be an aggressive irrigation 

First Part One hundred milliliters of 
saline is rapidly injected into the stomach 
quickly aspirated and reinjected Some 
tunes one half of the synnge is allowed 
to fill with air to project the fluid at a faster 
rate The tube is withdrawn a few cenii 
meters another 100 ml of fresh saUne is 
injected and vigorous washing (barbotage) 
IS continued for two minutes The aspirate 
is placed immediately into 50 ml tubes 
which are immersed in an ice bath (This 
procedure is important because the cells are 
to be preserved ) About 300 to 400 ml of 
fluid is used dimng the first portion of the 
irrigation 

Second Part Five hundred milliliters of 
salme is introduced into the stomach The 
patient then lies in each of the following 
positions for two minutes on the right side 
(he back die abdomen and Anally the left 
side The fluid is withdrawn after the patient 
has been lying on his left side (usually 
about 400 ml can be recovered) The fluid 
IS placed m tubes immersed in an ice bath 

When the test is completed the specimen 
should be delivered to the laboratory imme 
diately Note Gastric specimens taken for 
chemical analysis will not be at all satis

CEREBROSPINAL FLUID 

Cerebrospinal fluid is obtained by lumbar 
puncture betw een the third and fourth lum 
bar vertebrae with a flexible needle hiving 
a length of about 10 cm ajid a bore of 
I to 1 S mm and provided wath a stylet 
For children a shorter needle is used The 
needle and the stylet are sterilized by boil

pared as for a venipuncture A local anes 
thetic IS usually used the skin and suiicu 
taneous tissue being infiltrated with a sterile 
1 per cent solunon of procaine hydrochlo- 
ride The patient should he on one side his 
head so placed on a pillow that there is no 
pressure on his neck and the head is in 
line with the vertebra? column The neck 
should be moderately flexed forward and

]oimng the crests of the iha The needle is 
inserted in the midhne and pushed directly 
forw’ard tnth a quick thrust until it reaches 
the lough spinous ligaments when it may be 
pushed more slowly A sudden cessauon of 
resistance indicates that it has entered the 
spinal canal The stylet is then remo\ed 
and the fluid should flow at once If it fails 
to do so the flow usually maj be started by 
inserting the needle a hide farther or pull 
mg It out a tnfle by inserting the stylet to 
dislodge anything that may hate clogged 
the needle or by hating the patient take a 
deep breath 

The pressure under tt hich the fluid appears 
should be noted Normally the fluid dnps 
rather slosviy from the needle IVhen under 
high pressure it spurts out In the presence 
of obtiously eletated pressure only a small 
amount of spinal fluid should be withdrawn 
as slowly as possible and jugular compres 
Sion must not be earned out Tlic pressure 
is measured by attaching the manometer 
with a ihrecsway stopcock (Fig 2&-1) to 
the end of the needle Spinal fluid pres 
sure will ordinarily nsc to lOO and 200 
mm Initial pressures are often some- 
what higher than this owing to cle\'ited 
abdommal pressure resulung from an mer 


flexed position or from anxiety \Vhen the 
patient is in a comfortable position and iie 
IS instructed to breathe through his mouth, 
the pressure will normally drop below 200 
mm 

Patency of the spinal subarachnoid space 
can be tested by the Queckenstedt ma 
neuter Moderate bilateral compression on 
the jugular tessds is maintain^ until the 
spinal fluid pressure rises to approximately 
400 mm Compression is released and the 
fluid returns toward the resting lex el Both 
the nse and fall should occur rapidly Willi 
complete jugular compression the pressure 
should reach 400 mm svithln about fi\e 
seconds After release the base fine should 
be reached within ten seconds The rate of 
fall is a more reliable observauon than the 
rafeofnse, since ins dt/liouh tostandirdae

When the manometer has been Tcmoxcd 
the first few drops of fluid are discarded, 
since they almost invariably contain some 
blood owing to passage of the puncture 
needle Then approximately 3 ml of fluid 
IS collected in each of three sfenle test 
tubes

Normally cerebrospinal fluid Is water 
clear and limpid The reaction is slightly 
alkaline and the speafic gravit> is 1 003 to 
1 008 The fluid may be tinged wth blood 
owing to accidental puncture of a small 
Ncssel The appearance of fresh blood is 
not to be confused with the dull red or 
brown color that is characteristic of true 
hemorrhage When the bleeding is extensue 
and recent It may ha\c the appearance of 
practically pure blood When the fluid Is 
collected in three tubes and the third lube 
does not look ob\iousl> clearer than the 
first subarachnoid hemorrhage must be 
considered When blood is present a tube 
should be centrifuged in order to note the 
color of the supernatant fluid If the fluid 
Is clear It is unlikely that the blood has 
been present in the subarachnoid space for 
more than a few hours If the fluid is yellow 
(xanthochromic) the blood has been 
present for more than a few hours and 
cannot be ascribed to the trauma of the 
puncture 

In spinal cord tumors and other lesions 
producing obstruction in the subarachnoid 
space there may be an association of spinal 
fluid findings known as Froins syndrome 
These are great Increase in protein spon 
tancous coagulation moderate pleocytosis 
and xanthochromia 

In Infectious meningitis the fluid may 
exhibit varying degrees of cloudiness from 
a slight turbi^ty to almost pure pus Tur 
bidity resulting from the presence of cells 
becomes evident ivhen there are 500 or more 
cells per cubic millimeter In less acute 
forms of meningitis and in tuberculous 
meningitis the fluid is often clear or only 
faintly opalescent Turbidity oiving largely 
to the bactcnal content is especi^y char 
acteristic of pneumococcic memngiUs 

After standing for 12 to 24 hours the 
fluid may coagulate This occurs especially 
m the various forms of meningitis but rarely 
occurs in noninflammatory conditions In 
tuberculosis the coagulum is usually very 
delicate and cobweb-like and is not easily 
seen

Tests for the Albumin-GIobuIm Ratio 
^Lange's colloidal gold test Lange s col 
loidal gold test was mtroduced in 1912 and 
became one of the most widely used pro- 
cedures in this category It and the mastic 
test are retainedTiere largely for histone 
reasons Although these tests are still used 
toa very limited extent they have generally 
been replaced by more accurate serologic 
methods when syphdis is in quesuon or by 
ehem'^^i and chromatographic metliods 
when subtile changes in protein fracUon 
distnbuuon are being studied 

Lange s test is performed by mixing cere- 
brospinal fluid m certain proportions with 
a colloidal soluUon of gold Normal cerebro-

and only 0 5 ml of this solution in the other 
tubes Add 0 2 ml of the spinal fluid to the

0 S ml of the mixtiure to the next tube and 
so on to the last tube discarding 0 5 ml 
from this tube after mixing the fluids Then 
add only 2 5 ml of colloidal gold solution to 
aU the tubes 

•Elastic test Because of the many diffi 
culties in the older methods of preparing 
satisfactory and uniform colloidal gold solu 
tions the mastic test was proposed as a sub- 
stitute for the gold test The reagent ts mex 
pensite and easily made and the test Is 
easily earned out Results appear to parallel 
those obtained with coUoidjil gold They are 
almost uniformly posime in paresis cere 
brospuial syphilis and tabes but there is 
much less definite differentiation of the 
various types of xeacuon Complete precipl 
taiion of the mastic corresponds to complete 
decolonzation of the colloidal gold solution 
while parUal precipitation of the mastic 
corresponds roughl> to the purple or blue of 
the colloidal gold test The method following 
is that used by Cutting 

Reagents 

1 Masuc solution Make a stock solu 
tion by completely dissolving 10 gm of gum 
masuc U S P in 100 ml of absolute 
alcohol and filter To 2 ml of this stock. 
soluUon add 18 ml of absolute alcohol mix 
well and pour rapidly into SO ml of dis- 
tilled water 

2 Alkaline saline soluUon Make 1 25 
per cent soluuon of sodium chloride (CP) 
in distilled water, and to each 99 ml of this 
soluuon add 1 ml of a 0 5 per cent solutton 
of potassium carbonate in distilled water 

Technique Take six small test tubes 
In the fimt tube place 1 5 ml of the alkaline 


salme soluUon and in each of the others 
place 1 ml To the first tube add 0 5 ml of 
the spinal fluid which must be completely 
free from blood Mix by suckmg the fluid 
up into the pipet and expelling it, and 
transfer 1 ml to the second lube Again 
mix and transfer 1 ml to the third tube and 
continue down the Ime to the fifth tube, 
discarding the 1 ml poruon removed from 
this and leaving the sixth tube with alkalme- 
saUne soluuon alone to sene as a control 
Finally add 1 ml of the mastic soluuon 
to each tube Mlx vvcU and set aside at zoom 
temperature for 12 to 24 hours or in ^e 
incubator for 6 to 12 hours Tubes in which 
the reacuon is complete will show a heav? 
precipitate with dear supernatant fluid (Fig 
28-6) 

''Chlorides 

Normal spinal fluid contains more 
chlondes expressed as sodium chlonde 
than does blood plasma The normal value 
for adults vanes from 720 to 750 mg for 
each 100 ml of spinal fluid In children the 
value vanes from 625 mg to 760 mg per 
100 ml 

TTie detenmnation is made according to 
the method for plasma chlonde Use 1 ml 
of spmal fluid In acute_ meningitis the 
amount of chlonde may be reduced in 
adults to 625 mg per 100 ml and to 575 
mg per 100 ml in children In tuberculous 
menmgius suU smaller amounts are found 
High values may be found in conditions in 
niuch the vdue for the plasma chloride is 
increased 

Dextrose 

Cerebrospinal fluid normally contains 
about 0 04 to 0 07 per cent of dextrose or 
roughly half as much as is present in the 
blood Quantitame estijnauon may be car 
ried out by the methods used for blood 
sugar It is advisable to determine the con 
centranon of dextrose in a sample of the 


Exudates Transudates 

patient s blood obtained by venipuncture at 
the same time the spinal puncture is made 
For accurate comparison these determina 
uons should be earned out as promptly as 
possible after tvithdrawal 

Mtcroscoluc Lxammalion 

This mcludes a study of the bactena and 
of the number and kinds of cells Bacteno- 
logic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid 
is discussed In Chapter 37 

Cytologic Examination 

For cytologic examination the fluid should 
be as fresh as possible since the cells tend 
to degenerate To avoid formation of a co- 
agulum which might entangle the cells and 
interfere with the count it is well to secure 
the fluid in two tubes One tube that is to 
be used for the cytologic examination should 
contain a trace of powdered potassium 
oxalate Early coagulation is however not 
common in the diseases in tvhich the cell 
count IS most important 

The routine examination should include 
both a total and a differenual count The 
total cell count is best made with a Fuchs 
Rosenthal countmg chamber m a manner 
similar to the counting of leukocytes in 
blood The ruled area (Fig 26-7) in this 
chamber covers 16 sq mm and the depth 
below the coverglass is 0 2 mm The ca 
pacity IS thus a tnfle more than 3 cu mm 
(sixteen fifths) Unnas pol>chrome meth 
ylene blue or a staining fluid consisting of 
0 1 gm of crystal violet 1 ml of glacial 
acetic acid 50 ml of water and a few drops 
of 5 per cent solution of phenol Is drawn 
mto the leukocyte pipet to the mirk 1 and 
the fresh spinal fluid which has been well 
shaken is drawn up to the mark 11 After 
mixing a drop is placed in the counting 
chamber and covered The number of cells 
in the entire ruled area is counted and this 
number is divided by 3 to obtain the number 



Figure 26-7 Fuc! s Rosenthal rullnc of counting 
chamber for cells In spinal fiuid 


AND Cerebrospinal Fluid 92j 

of cells in each cubic millimeter of spinal 
fluid The error incident to this calculation 
is practically balanced by the opposite error 
owing to dilution 

When a FuchsBosenthal chamber is not 
at hand an ordinary hemacytometer count 
mg chamber may be used The number of 
cells m the ruled area is counted the num 
her for each cubic millimeter is calculated 
and this is multiplied by 10/9 to compen 
sate for the dilution with staining fluid 

The differential count is made as de 
scribed on p 323 A weak aqueous solution 
of methylene blue is probably preferable to 
U rights stain for this purpose Ordminly 
only two kinds of cells arc seen lympho- 
cytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils 

The cells normally present are nearly all 
lymphocytes They vary in number from one 
to five or seven in each cubic miUunctcr 
ten is usually accepted as the maximum in 
health 

An increase in the ccU count and i pre 
dominance of lymphocytes (more thin 70 
per cent) strongly suggest tuberculous 
memngitis or sypluhtic disease of the 
nervous system since these findings occur 
in about 90 to 95 per cent of the cases 
The number of cells present in tliesc contli 
tions vines greatly m different cases but 
ordinarily is between 25 and 300 m cich 
cubic millimeter Similar counts are fre 
quent in viral encephalitis and antenor 
pohomyeliUs and may also sometimes be 
noted in cases of cerebral hemorrhage 
tumor and the more chronic ty7>c of cpl 
demic cerebrospinal meningitis 

In all forms of acute meningitis the total 
count is Jilgh 100 to several thousind and 
polymorphonuclear leukocytes prevail A 
notable number of endothelial cells may ilso 
be present especially in cases of acute epi 
demic meningiUs 

In lymphocytic choriomeningitis an acute 
virus disease there is a marked lymphocytic 
reaction of the meninges and in the choroid 
plexus and the cell count is 30 to ISOO or 
more The disease Is characterized by 
marked milalse headache vomiting fever 
siiffncss of the neck and slow pulse Tliere 
arc no bacteria in the spinal fluid 

In some cases of polyneuritis the Guilliln 
Banx syndrome may occur Tlierc is no 
febrile reaction but motor weakness is prts

Diagnosis of Early Pregnancy 

By ISRAEL DAVIDSOHN, M.D 


Tests for early pregnancy are done in every 
hospital laboratory They are needed only 
rarel> in late pregnancy, then, the physician 
has other diagnostic procedures at his dis 
posal Various chemical tests for hormones 
are useful in the study of certain comphea 
tions of pregnancy but they will not be dis* 
cussed here 

The biologic tests employ animals Re- 
cently, immunologic and hematologic tests 
have come into use 

BIOLOGIC PREGNANCY TESTS 
Principle There is a significant de- 
tectable rise of chorionic gonadotropin 
(CG) in blood serum and unne of pregnant 
women It may also be produced by rare 
hormone producing tumors in both men and 
Women 

Injection of human chononic gonado 
tropm (HCG or CG) into certain animals 
produces chiractenstJC anatomic changes, 
mainly an easily demonstrable luteinizing 
elTect (production of corpora lutea) in the 
Ovanes of mice and rabbits, pronounced 
hyperemia in the o\aries of rats, and sccrc 
tlon of sperm or o\ a in toads and frogs 
CG IS the product of the Langhans cells 
of the chorionic layer of the placenta In 
pregnancy it Is detectable in tlic urine be 
ginning with about the 24th day following 
the first day of the last normal menstruil 
period Its output increases progressively, 
reaching a peak from about the GOth to 
70th day, followed by a progressive drop 
The biologic effect of the liotmonc and 
the sensitivity of different animal specie^ 
vary consldcrnbly In amphllilans there arc 
also seasonal variitions in scnsltiiiiy 


Vrinf 

For the qualitative test the first morning 
specimen is preferable, for the quantitative 
test a 12 or 24 hour specimen is needed 

Instructions to Patient 

1 Intalic of fluid should be restricted from 8 00 
r M until the mornins collection of urine 

2 The patient should not t-tke salicylates fas 
pirm), barbiturates or other sedatives for at 
least 48 hours prior to collection of urine 

3 TTi# first morning specimen should be collected 
m ft clean glass container 

4 About 60 ml of unne is needed, this will luf 
flee in case urine is to be detoxified 


Preparation of Specimen 

The specimen should be clev otherwise it 
should be filtered or centrifuged No preservatives 
should be added 

n»e specimen should be kept in ihe refrigerator 
and placed at room temperature for ai>out 30 min 
utes prior to injection

Irudmg corpora lutea and/or grossly visible 
hemorrhagic folhcles are present in one or 
more ammals A. hand lens helps to identify 
the corpus luteum If m doubt, examination 
of histologic sections may help The test is 
reported to be positive in 95 to 98 per cent 
of cases of early pregnancy It is also posl 
tive in hydatidiform mole and in chonon 
epithehoma 

£i>n/n/ition Highly specific and sensi 
tive, but rarely used because (1) a large 
number of animals of specified age and mul 
Uple injections are needed, (2) Siere is loss 
of a substantial number of mice unless 
unne is detoxified, and (3) it takes a rela 
tively Jong time (100 hours) 

The Quani/tatiie Test The quantitatne 
pregnancy lest is used mainly for condi 
tions other than normal pregnancy such as 
hydatidiform mole, chononepitheboma and 
so forth The urine has to be detoxified 


1 Mix urui® specimen well filter 30 ml of unne 
into a separatory funnel and add 90 ml of 
ether

3 Draw off the lower unne layer into an open 
beaker 

4 Let the urine stand uncovered under the hood 
until the residual ether has evaporated 

5 Dissolve 0 9 gm of glucose in this ether free 
urine and keep fn a refrigerator until ready for 
use but not longer than 2 hours The dialysis 
method of detoxification is described later (see 
p 926 D) 


Procedure White female mice weighuig

animal with one hand and one leg with the 
other 

^Vhen serum is mjected mstead of unne 
addition of hyaluromdase facilitates absorp- 
tion of serum One half ml is added to each 
ml of serum and 1 ml of the soluuon is 
used for each 10 gm of bodj weight 

The toads are returned to jars At hourlj 
intervals urine voided is examined for sper 
matozoa If no unne is present urme can be 
obtained by inserting a capillary pipet mto 
the cloaca or the frog can be forced to 
unnate by flexmg its thighs while holding 
the head and shoulders in the hand 

Result Both animals positive test is 
positive one ammal is positive test is m 
conclusne should be repeated both are 
negative the Fnedman rabbit test should 
be done 

2 Male Rana pipiens 

The easiest way to identify the sex of the 
ammal is to look at the thumbs In the male 
they are larger than the other digits and 
heavily pigmented In the female the digits 
are of the same size and lightly pigmented 
They should be kept at temperatures ring 
ing from 40 to 60® F 

Procedure Same as for Bufo amen 
cantis The frog spermatozoa are cigar 
shaped and have transparent flagella at one 
end 

Dran backs False reactions which may 
occur especiall> in the spring and early 
summer in about 10 per cent of the animals 
can be reduced by using three animals for 
each test The test is conclusive if all am 
Dials are positiie or negative and equivocal 
If only one or two are posltue in which 
case a rabbit test is recommended By using 
3 animals the theoretic error is reduced to 
about 0 1 per cent 

Rana clamitans is considerably less sub- 
ject to seasonal \anations in sensitivity and 
can be substituted for the Rana pipiens 
during the summer months 

3 Female Xenopos laevis (Sootu 
African clawed frog) 

Procedure Use two female animals 
each weighing from 40 to 100 gm Tiso and 
one half ml of concentrated unne is In 
jected into the dorsal lymph sac Each nnl 
mal is placed in a separate jar on a per

Clinical Diignosis 

forated supporting platform beneath which 
the ova are collected 

Result The result is posiUve if at least 
one toad ovulates withm 48 hours 

Drmvbacks The low sensitivity of the 
animals requires concentration of unne 
and false negative results are frequent The 
animals are expensive in the Umted States 


TOXIC URINE 

Toxicity of unne may be responsible for 
(1) false negauve results by depressing the 
metabolism of the injected animal and (2) 
for death of the animal 

Toxicity may be caused by excess of elec 
trolytes especially potassium bactenal con 
tammation or other toxic substances 
Salicylates and barbiturate medication may 
contribute to the toxicity of unne Patients 
should be advised not to take these drugs 
for several days before the test 

Dialysis in cellophane tubing for 30 to 60 
minutes under running water may reduce 
the electrolyte content It may reduce the 
loss of animals from 15 to 3 per cent Acidi 
ficatjon with 0 1 N hydrochJonc acid to a 
pH of about 6 0 may make bactenally con 
laminated unne less toxic Extraction vvith 
ether or alcohol and absorption with kaolin 
are also efTicient detoxifiers 

Subcutaneous injecuon of 20 ml of unne 
into rabbits has been reported equally re 
liable as intravenous injection of half that 
amount with the advantage of reduang 
toxicity (Ducey 1950) 

False positive relictions are caused by 
positive responses to substances other than 
chononlc gonadotropin such as high titers 
of pituitary gonadotropin (PG) from any 
cause high tilers of folhcle-stimulallng hor 
mone (FSH) in menopause or primary 
ovarian failure and a variety of drugs 
eg chlorpromazine denvatives (compa 
zme) phenothiazme compound (Thora 
zine and Spanne) (Hilbert 1959) and 
aspinn These drugs should not bo pven 
for at least 48 hours before ihe test 
Folse Tiegotiie reocflons arc caused by 
low sensiuviiy of the animal sometimes re 
sulung from seasonal variations or from 
metabolic depression by toxic urine Frogs 
and toads are generally less sensitive than 
mice rabbits and rats Injection of ibe 
necessarily larger amount of unne is not 
well tolerated by the animals Consequently 
concentration of chorionic gonadotropin In 
the unne is necessary For techniques of 
concentration see Horn and Moms 19o9 


Laboratorv iMetiiods 

ASSA'iING OF CHORIONIC 
GONADOTROPIN IN URINE 

The concentration of CG is expressed in 
animal umts There are rat units mouse 
units male and female toad and frog units 
et cetera Animal umts are dilhcuU to com 
pare More accurate is the intemauonal unit 
(lU) of HCG which is the specific gonado- 
tropic actmty of 0 1 mg of a dried standard 
kept at the National Institutes of Health m 
London It is the amount of activity suf 
ficient to cause cormfication of the vaginal 
epithelium of immature rats 


SEROLOGIC TEST TOR PREGN VNC\ 

Principle The serologic test for preg 
nancy like most other pregnancy tests is 
based on the presence of human chononic 
gonadotropin (HCG) in the unne and serum 
of pregnant women and on the ability of 
HCG to sumulate the production of specific 
antibodies demonslrabJe in vitro (Bussard 
and Grabar 1947) 

Serologic tests for pregnancy have been 
described (McKean J960 Wide and Gem 
zell 1960) Latex paruclcs are coated with 
purified HCG and serve as antigen capable 
of reacting with nn anti HCG immune 
serum produced m rabbits Anti HCG serum 
is Incubated with the patients unne If the 
patient is pregnant the HCG In the urine 
will neutralize the antibodies in the anti 
serum and added latex particles coated with 
HCG will not agglutmate The supernatant 
will remain turbid (positive test) If the 
patient is not pregnant the antisemm will 
not be neutralized and will nggUiunate the 
latex pariicJes which will drop to the hot 
tom leaving a clear supernatant (negative 
test) 

Procctlurc 

1 A f m tHorntne specimen with n specific srav

5 Positive and negative controls are recom 
mended 

Inteqiretation Turbidity greater than 
standard* positive test turbidity less than 
standard negative test turbidity same as 
standard result doubtful examination to 
be repeated If result is again doubtful a 
biologic test IS mdicated Known positive 
and negative controls should be tested with 
each new lot of antiserum and antigen 

The test is positive also in chorionepi 
thehoma and in hydatidiform mole Goldin 
(1962) found the latex test more sensitive 
than the male frog test and equal to the 
rabbit test provoded the recommended tech 
nique (especially the speed and length of 
centrifugation) were closely adhered to 
The toxicity of unne so troublesome in the 
biologic tests does not interfere with the 
serologic test Henry and Little (1962) had 
similar expenence 

The use of serum instead of unne is not 
recommended 


LEUKOCYTE ALKALINE THOSPHA 
TASE TEST (AP GL) TOR PREGNANC\ 

Principle Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase 
18 an enzyme capable of hydrolj'zing phos 
phorus from a variety of phospho-monoes 
fees (Kaplow 1955) (seep 243) Pntekard 
reported in 1957 and Quigley et al con 
finned an increase of the enzyme m preg 
nancy 

Harrer and Quigley found the enzyme test 
reliable in a study of 119 women It was 
positive (score of 80 or more) within 37 
days from onset of the last period in 98 per 
cent of cases of prov en pregnancy The test 
vvas positive in some instances at the time 
of the first missed penod The score re- 
mained high throughout pregnancj 

The reported results compare favorably 
with the tests based on chorionic gonado 
tropm which are of value mainly from 50 
to 100 days from the onset of the last 
penod 

Procedure Alkaline phosphatase stam

The etnplo>TTient of many tests means 
that the ideal test is not yet available Each 
has its ad\ antages and drawbacks None of 
the presently available biologic or serologic 
tests IS a pregnancy test m the true sense 
of the word They are tests for a hormone 
which may be present in similar and even 
larger amounts in conditions other than 
pregnancy The leukocyte alkaline phos 
phatase test is based on a histochemical re 
acuon which also is not limited to preg 
nancy

Examinatioii of tke Semen 


Bj ISRAEL DAVIDSOHN, M D 


The pathologist is called upon to examine 
semen on two occasions 
2 Study of male fertility 
2 Examinations of stains In suspected 
rape 

STUm or MALE FERTILm 

This includes examination of pH vis 
cosity %olume total sperm count motility 
study of abnormal forms of spermatozoa 
white blood cell count and bacteria 

Normal Simen The volume of an e}acv 
lation is from 3 to 6 ml but \olumes up to 
15 ml are accepted as normal It is color 
less to creamy gelatinous and has a char 
acteristic odor and a pH of 7 2 to 8 0 From 
60 to 3QQ million spermatozoa per ml of 
semen is usually quoted as the normal 
count but counts as low as 20 million with 
40 per cent motihty are considered ade 
quate Hyaluromdase is normally present 
Its concentration parallels the sperm count 
and it may be absent in azoospermia 

Collection Semen should be kept warm 
until examined When it must be trans 
ported any considerable distance a lacuum 
bottle may be used Wlien such a bottle is 
not available the following method is con 
\ement The fresh semen is placed m a 
small bottle to the neck of wWch a string 
IS attached This is then suspended from a 
button on the trousers so that the bottle 
rests against the skin of the inguinal region 
The specimen should be dehvered to the 
laboratory as quickly as possible and not 
later than 2 hours after emission The usual 
method of obtaining semen is by masturba 
Uon coitus intemiptus followed by emission 


into a clean ivide mouth glass bottle or con 
dom coUecuon The condom must first be 
washed to Temo\e powder and then dned 
All of these procedures may be highly ob 
jecuonable to many There are two other 
methods A drop of cervical mucus obtained 
not liter than 2 hours after intercourse per 
nwts a sperm count and examination of mo- 
Hilly in a wet drop and of abnormal forms 
in a stained smear (the Sims or Huhner 
test) Best results are obtained if the test 
coincides with ovulation when the cervical 
mucus is clear transparent and reJattiely 
free from leukocytes This procedure makes 
It possible to proie imasion of the cervical 
mucus by spermatozoa It is estimated that 
a count of 100 spermatozoa per high power 
field with xlOO magnification is equivalent 
to a count of approximately 80 imlhon per 
ml 

In the second method the patient is in 
structed to place on a shde a few drops of 
the urethal contents after the completion of 
normal intercourse to place a coier glass 
over it immediately and to bring it in a 
proper container to the laboratory within 
less than 2 hours This examination permits 
the diagnosis of oligospermia and azoo 
spermia (Dunn 1959) To examine the 
semen place a large drop on a wanned 
shde and apply a coverglass The spermato- 
zoa are readily seen with a 4 mm objective 
(p 50 Fig 3-17) Normally they are abun 
dant and in actiie motion To facilitate 
counting the motile cells the field is re- 
duced by covenng three fourths of the ocu 
lar lens and counting rapidly first the ac 
lively motile spermatozoa and then all the 
spermatozoa in this field The percentage of 



926 H Climcv\l Diagnosis b\ 

the motile cells is calculated Two fields are 
counted and the average recorded Estuna 
Uon of motihty by examination of a drop of 
semen on a sUde under the microscope is 
highly subjective Smith and Neuman 
(1961) reported an objective method They 
measured the migration of spermatozoa in 
upnght polyethylene plastic tubmg 

If an estimation of the number is desired 
spermatozoa may be counted as are leuko- 
cytes by using a 0 5 per cent solution of 
chloramine T (Chlorazene) as a diluent 
Draw the semen to the 0 5 mark in a leuko- 
cyte pipet and draw the chloramine T to the 
11 mark Shake for three minutes and place 
a drop on a hemacytometer counting cham 
ber Count the number of spermatozoa m 2 
sq mm and add 5 zeros to obtain the num 
ber per ml This will normally be many 
millions 

Stained Smear Smears may be made as 
are blood smears They should be dned by 
holding them face dowm high above a flame 
and then fixed by the heat of the flame 
Allow the slides to stand for several hours 
to dry thoroughly before staimng by the 
following techmque Place in 0 5 per cent 
chloramine T for three minutes and then 
wash in water Dehydrate by placing in 95 
per cent alcohol and allow the shdes to dry 
Stain with crystal violet (0 2S per cent) for 
two to three minutes wash m water and 
decolorize with 95 per cent alcohol for 
twenty seconds Again wash in water and 
stain with rose bengal (1 per cent) for ten 
seconds Wash in water dry in the air and 
mount In Canada balsam Make a differen 
nal count of from 200 to 500 spermatozoa 
md record the percentage of normal and 
abnormalhcads A normal head, Is uniformly 
oval with good demarcation between the 
lightly stained forepart and the deeply 
stained posterior portion Any deviation in 
size shape or unctorial charactcnstlcs of 
the head classifies the spermatozoon as ab- 
normal Any increase above 20 per cent of 
abnormal heads may be considered patho- 
logic For a consideration of the importance 
of examination of spermatozoa and for ref 
erences to the literature the reader Is re 
ferred to the studies of Moench (1940)

The Clinical Pathologic 


Laboratory 


SPACE. EQUIPMENT. AND 
MODERNIZATION 

The changes m the modem clinical 
pathologic laboratory mainly in^ohe in 
creasing emphasis on accuracy, on quanti 
tame versus qualitative methods and on 
specific versus nonspecific results The ns 
mg utilization of the laboratory and the 
resulting increase in costs and shortage of 
manpower are being met b) simphficaiion 
of methods without loss of spccificit} and 
rehabihty by saving of unnecessary steps 
b> better organization of space and finally 
by ever increasing automation Some of 
these developments are not unhke what one 
sees in a modern kitchen less unnecessar> 
motion and handhng better illuminauon 
less odors and less noise 

In small hospitals one central laboratory 
is most comeiUent In larger hospitals In 
addition to a central laboratory small lab 
oratory units are needed to permit interns 
and residents to carry out personaU> some 
ol the simpler tests This experience should 
be a part of the medical education 

The relation of tlie physician to the lab 
oratory should not be limited to ^vniing 
requests for tests If that is the onlv link 
the physician cannot possibly appreciate 
the various sources of error and reUabtlU> 
of methods and consequently will not be 
able to interpret the results It should not 
be overlooked that it is during this stage 
of education of the medical student and 
)Oung physician that interest In scientific 
aspects of medicine ma> be planted to lead 


eventually to scientific careers and sigmfi 
cant contributions 

Should there be fewer large rooms or 
many smaller ones? Smaller rooms have 
certain advantages more wall space for 
shelves an important and most useful item 
in a laboratory, less noise and the possl 
bilii> of placing highl> sensitive equipment 
In separate toottis CliemJcal tvork requires 
a room large enough to permit a cenirall> 
located working area accessible from all 
sides The height and width of the benches 
should mike them easily accessible con 
veraent to reach and adjustable to cither 
standing or sitting as needed The bench 
tops should be acid resistant, some of the 
modem plastics meet these requirements 
Shelves for reagents easily within reach of 
the sitting or standing technologists arc 
essentia] Properly constructed drawers 
under the tables are useful The) can be 
used to keep vanous maienals such as 
pipets but are not practical for reagents 
The latter are kept best in wall cabinets 
located withm easy reach Tlie shelves 
should not be too wide It is best to liavc 
only one row of reagents on the shelves 
for ease of handhng 

Small bench sinks with hot and cold 
water and vacuum pumps are a great con 
venicnce Convenient!) located outlets for 
gas and electricity are absoUitel) essential 
outlets for vacuum pressure hot steam 
and distilled water arc a great convenience 
when needed There should be a shelf over 
the sink to hold a large liottle wiiii distilled 
water Small easily transported cans serve

Clinical Diagnosis by 

the double purpose of adding to the avail 
able surface area and permitting convement 
transport to the glass washing area The 
wall space not taken up by doors cabinets 
and other equipment should be used for 
benches Much information regarding lab 
oratory equipment glassware and supph^ 
can be gathered from the study of cat^ogs 
issued by the manufacturers and dealers 
For example different procedures may re 
quire different varieties of glass which dif 
fer in thermal and mechamcal resistance 
thickness and even shape 

Dayhght is desirable mainly for psycho 
logic reasons Southern exposure should be 
avoided Adequate artificial hght should be 
provided for each working area m addiuon 
to ceiling hght 

The most convement floor covering that 
is also easiest for the feet is one of the 
many varieties of Imoleum or similar rub 
her substitutes Damage by acids and stains 
can be easily corrected Cement is cold 
hard and unpleasant stone and cement 
are best in washing areas 

Hoods are needed espeaally m the chemi 
cal laboratory They should be provided 
with light electricity gas water exhaust 
and dram Refrigerators are needed in each 
laboratory Cold rooms are useful m larger 
Institutions Two smaller refrigerators are 
better than a large one of double capacity 
for mechanical troubles will be less trouble 
some The cold room serves not onij for 
storage but is also useful for certain lab 
oratory procedures' such &s e]ectrophor€Sis 
or chromatography Mimmum cold room re 
quirements are outlets for electrical current 
water and dram Illumination should be 
adequate but not more than what fs really 
reqiured to avoid overheating In cold rooms 
that are used for actual work it is advisable 
to reduce the air flow to the essential mim 
mum Too rapid a turnover of air makes 
the stay m the cold room too uncomfott 
able An outside red light is recommended 
to indicate that a person is in the cold 
room Another useful installation is an 
alarm to warn when the thermostat is out 
of commission 


Laboratorv Methods 

The glass cleaning area must be provided 
with not less than four smks one for pre- 
liminary cleansing the second for thorough 
washing the third for rinsing witli tap 
water and the fourth with distilled water 
To facilifite operation of the latter a size 
able bottle or another source of distilled 
water is convement Proper equipment for 
cleanmg of pipets dram areas dryang 
ovens and ample large sized drains are also 
needed 

It is best to have a special room for 
centrifuges If they must be in a workmg 
area provision should be made to reduce 
noise 

It IS convenient to have an mstrumenta 
tion room for hght and vibration sensitive 
equipment and for bulky instruments re 
qiunng easy access from all sides 

Suitable safety provisions are needed to 
protect against accidents from electnc and 
gas installations fireproof hose connections 
for Bunsen burners instead of rubber tub- 
mg and safe grounding of electncal con 
nections Gas cyhnders and other bulky con 
tainers must be safely fastened against pos 
sible turning over Access to fire exits must 
be kept open Advice from safety experts 
IS a good investment 

Rest rooms for male and female person 
nel are desirable They can also be used is 
sleepmg areas for the night technicians and 
for conferences at daytime

potassium nitrate add 1 ml of solution A 
followed by 1 ml of solution B added drop 
by drop If mtnte is present, a pmk, red 
or maroon color is produced 

2 If no color develops this indicates the 
absence of mtnte and may mean that the 
mtrate is not reduced or that both the 
nitrate and the mtnte have been reduced 

3 In order to determine defimtely that 
the mtrate has not been reduced the follow 
mg procedure can be used 

a Add a small amount of zinc dust 
to the culture and the nitrate re 
agents 

b If a red color develops the zinc has 
reduced nitrate to nitnte This mdi 
cates that nitrate was present and 
was not reduced by bacterial action 
c If no red color develops this indi 
cates that the bactena ha\e reduced 
both mtrates and nitrites

Other Slanting Solutions 

In this section are given the formulas for 
a few widely used staimng fluids that have 
not been Included in the text Other stains 
that arc used only for special purposes are 
discussed in the body of the book and may be 
found by consulting the index 

Acid fast Stain Kinyoun carbolfuchsm 
acid fast stain (Am J Pub Health 5 867 
1915) Formula basic fuchsm 4 gm 
phenol crystals 8 gm 95 per cent alcohol 
20 ml and distilled water 100 ml Stain 
fixed smear for three rmnutes (no heat 
necessary) and continue as with Ziehl Neel 
sen stain 

Rivic Fuchsm This dye should not be 
confused with acid fuchsm Solutions of this 
dye are generally made with phenol as a 
mordant and they are then very powerful 
bacterial stains with a strong tendency to 
cause overstauiing They are used chiefly to 
stain the tubercle bacillus 

Carbol Tliioninc Saturated solution of 
thionine in 50 per cent alcohol 20 ml 2 
per cent aqueous solution of phenol 100 ml 
This stain is used as a general stain In blood 
work it is sometimes used to demonstrate 
the malarial parasite and to demonstrate 
basophilic degeneration of the red cells The 
fluid IS applied for one half to three minutes 
after fixation by heat or for about a minute 
in a 1 per cent aqueous solution of mercuric 
chloride or in a 1 per cent solution of forma 
lin m alcohol 

Crystal Violet Crystal violet a powerful 
bactenal stain may be substituted for gen 
nan violet in aU formulas and is more satis 
factory A solution of 2 gm crystal violet 
m 100 ml methyl alcohol of the highest 
puniy IS probably the best stain for Gram s 
method

Gentian Violet This dye has long been 
■widely used as a bacterial stain especially 
for Grams method but is now being rap- 
idly displaced by crystal \iolet and methyl 
violet Methyl \iolet or crystal violet may 
be substituted for gentian violet 

Giemsa s Stain for Blood Immerse the 
shde m stain diluted 1 to 50 for 30 to 45 
minutes Rinse gently m disuUed water for 
three to five minutes Dry in air and ex 
amine Do not blot 

Hematoxylin Hematoxyhn is one of the 
best nuclear stains available There are 
many combinations most of which require 
weeks or months for “ripening " The foUow 
mg IS a good solution which is ready for 
use as soon as made 

Hams' hematovyhn Dissolve 1 gm 
hematoxyhn crystals in 10 ml alcohol

are stained deep blue and are clearly de- 
fined No granules are seen in the lympho- 
cytes Fewer and lU defined granules are

Pyronine Used in strong aqueous solu 
uon this is useful as a contrast stain in 
Grams method but results are more satis- 
factory when the dye is combined wtth 
methyl green 

Pappenheim s 'Jctlivl Green Pyron ne 
This solution colors bacteria red and th* 
nuclei of cells blue It is therefore espe- 
cially useful for staining intracellular ba

bacillus It 15 a good stain for routine pur 
poses IS an excellent contrast stain for 
Grams method and is also used to demon 
straie Dohle s inclusion bodies in the blood 
It colors the cytoplasm of lymphocytes 
bnght red and has been used as a differen 
tial stain for these cells Tlie soluuon is ap- 
phed cold for one-half to five minutes It 
consists of a saturated aqueous solution of 
methyl green 3 to 4 parts and a saturated 
aqueous soluuon of pyronine 1 to 1*^ parts 
It IS a good plan to keep these solutions m 
stock and to mix a new lot of the stainin'^ 
fluid about once a month If staming vdfh 
either dye is too deep the proper balaitef 
is attained by adding a httle of the other

And Hose Indicators* 

An acid base indicator is a weak acid or 
a weak base the undissociatcd form of 
which has another color and constitution 
than the logcnic form An indicator docs 
not change its color from the purely ncid 
to the purely alkaline side at a definite 
hydrogen concentration, but the color 
change takes place over a certain range of 
hydrogen ion concentrations This range is 
called the color change interval and is ex 
pressed in terms of pM (the negative loga 
nthm of the hydrogen Ion concentration) 
A great number of substances show indi 
cator properties although relatively few of 
iliero arc practically applied for neutrall 
zaiion reactions and pH determinations In 
general, weak acids should be titrated in the 
presence of indicators that change in 
slightly alkaline solutions IVcak bases 
should be titrated in the presence of Indi 
cators tiiat change in slightly acid solutions
